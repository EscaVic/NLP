0,Police find mass graves with at least '15 bodies' near Mexico town where 43 students disappeared after police clash,"Danny Boyle is directing the untitled film

Seth Rogen is being eyed to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak in Sony’s Steve Jobs biopic.

Danny Boyle is directing the untitled film, based on Walter Isaacson's book and adapted by Aaron Sorkin, which is one of the most anticipated biopics in recent years.

Negotiations have not yet begun, and it’s not even clear if Rogen has an official offer, but the producers — Scott Rudin, Guymon Casady and Mark Gordon — have set their sights on the talent and are in talks.

Of course, this may all be for naught as Christian Bale, the actor who is to play Jobs, is still in the midst of closing his deal. Sources say that dealmaking process is in a sensitive stage.

Insiders say Boyle will is flying to Los Angeles to meet with actress to play one of the female leads, an assistant to Jobs. Insiders say that Jessica Chastain is one of the actresses on the meeting list.

Wozniak, known as ""Woz,"" co-founded Apple with Jobs and Ronald Wayne. He first met Jobs when they worked at Atari and later was responsible for creating the early Apple computers.",unrelated
1,Hundreds of Palestinians flee floods in Gaza as Israel opens dams,"Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.

The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.

Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.

The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.

The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering.

Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.

Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.

The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.

Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.

Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.

This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.

In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.

In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning.",agree

4,Spider burrowed through tourist's stomach and up into his chest,"Fear not arachnophobes, the story of Bunbury's ""spiderman"" might not be all it seemed.

Perth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man's body during his first trip to Bali. The story went global on Thursday, generating hundreds of stories online.

Earlier this month, Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing ""a really burning sensation like a searing feeling"" in his abdomen.

Dylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin.

Thomas said a specialist dermatologist was called in and later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a ""tropical spider"".

But it seems we may have all been caught in a web... of misinformation.

Arachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was, it was ""almost impossible"" for the culprit to have been a spider.

""If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin,"" he said.

""We thought it may have been something like a mite, there are a few different parasitic mites out there, which can sometimes look a bit like a spider. I can't think of any spider which could do this to a person.""

Dr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case ""bizarre"".

""I must confess I was amazed because I've never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human, or indeed any mammal,"" he said.

""Spiders need air to breathe, they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive.

""Even if it was a mite, I've never seen anything like this. Even if it was an insect, I've never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this, so it really is a remarkable case.""

Dr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends.
""We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin. Then [the baby spiders] burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics,"" he said.

""None of those are true, they're just made up stories.

""They're not actually able to dig through the skin, that's why this case is so unusual. Some can burrow into soil, but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that.""

Something which is true, according to Dr Harvey, is that certain arachnids do ""live on humans"".

""We all have mites living on our faces. They're follicle mites, but they're absolutely miniscule and you can't see them. We transmit them to our children when we have kids,"" he said.

""They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin. Those mites are so small, you can't see them, and they're not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach.""

Dr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender, dead or alive, and enlisting the help of experts.

""It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it,"" he said.

""If you have been bitten by something, the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral.""

Dylan Thomas has been contacted for comment.

5,'Nasa Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December' Fake News Story Goes Viral,"Thousands of people have been duped by a fake news story claiming that Nasa has forecast a total blackout of earth for six days in December.

The story, entitled ""Nasa Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2014!"" originated from Huzlers.com, a website well known for publishing fake stories with sensational headlines.

The bogus report read: ""Nasa has confirmed that the Earth will experience 6 days of almost complete darkness and will happen from the dates Tuesday the 16 – Monday the 22 in December. The world will remain, during these three days, without sunlight due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight.

""The head of Nasa Charles Bolden who made the announcement and asked everyone to remain calm. This will be the product of a solar storm, the largest in the last 250 years for a period of 216 hours total.

""Despite the six days of darkness soon to come, officials say that the earth will not experience any major problems, since six days of darkness is nowhere near enough to cause major damage to anything.""

Adding on, the article also carried a made-up quote from Nasa scientist Earl Godoy, saying: ""We will solely rely on artificial light for the six days, which is not a problem at all.""

6,"Accused Boston Marathon Bomber Severely Injured In Prison, May Never Walk Or Talk Again","A British fighter who travelled to Iraq to stop the Islamic State claims the terror group fed a murdered kidnap victim to his own mother after she went to their headquarters and demanded to see him.

Yasir Abdulla, a security guard from Keighley, West Yorkshire decided to go to Iraq and fight against ISIS after hearing they came within six miles of taking control of his home village in Kurdistan, which he left in 2000.

It has been reported that the 36-year-old bought a set to combat fatigues online for £100 before going to Kurdistan and buying an assault rifle.

From Yorkshire to Iraq: Security guard Yasir Abdulla (left near his home and right patrolling the border of his home town of Sheikhan, Iraq) joined hundreds of fighters trying to stop the spread of ISIS

On patrol: Mr Abdulla (right) pictured with an Islamic State fighter who he and others had detained

He then joined hundreds of other Kurdish and Peshmerga forces who are trying to stop the spread of ISIS by patrolling a ten-mile front line in Iraq.

Mr Abdulla returned to the UK last week but told The Sun how an elderly Kurdish woman, whose son was captured by ISIS and taken to Mosul, went to meet the jihadis to try and secure his release and was then fed his body.

Slaughter: Mr Abdulla with a member of ISIS who he said was killed after he beheaded a Kurd

The father of four told the newspaper: 'She was determined to find her son and went to ISIS headquarters and asked to see him.

'The ISIS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

'They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were kind.

'But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said ""You've just eaten him.""'

During his time on the front line, Mr Abdulla revealed how ISIS are terrorising locals by calling them and threatening to kidnap them and bury them alive unless they surrender.

He also told of how the terror group kill prisoners they capture by throwing them on a 'human bonfire' and that he saw his own cousin killed in an ISIS attack.

But despite returning back to his family in Yorkshire, Mr Abdulla is keen to go back to Kurdistan saying he wants to finish the job in defeating ISIS.

The new details about the cruelty of ISIS come as Iraq's prime minister called on tribal fighters to abandon the jihadis ahead of an offensive to retake Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from extremists.

Haider al-Abadi offered no timeline for an attack on Tikrit, 80 miles north of Baghdad, which fell into the hands of ISIS last summer.

ISIS and Al Qaeda are hiding messages to their followers in digitally-altered eBay photos and even pornography, a book claims.

Investigative journalist Gordon Thomas said Al Qaeda has used the tactic of 'steganography' - concealing messages in audio clips or images widely available online - to encode items listed for sale on the auction site.

It works by manipulating a sound waveform or the order of pixels in a small or invisible part of an image, a process not unlike the way teletext used to be delivered on analogue TVs.

Now Israeli intelligence service Mossad believes ISIS militants are doing the same, according to Mr Thomas.

One intelligence source told him messages are often hidden on Reddit or 'X-rated pornographic pictures which conceal documents and orders for the next target'.

The claims are contained within new chapters of Mr Thomas' book Gideon's Spies, an extract of which was published yesterday by the New York Post.

However, Shiite militias and Iraqi security forces have stationed themselves around Tikrit as state-run media has warned that the city 'will soon return to its people.'

Tikrit, which occasionally saw attacks on U.S. forces during the American occupation of the country, is one of the biggest cities held by ISIS.

It also sits on the road to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, which is also held by the extremists.

It has also been revealed that in February alone, violence across Iraq killed at least 1,100 Iraqis, including more than 600 civilians, according to the the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq.

UN envoy Nickolay Mladenov blamed the deaths on the extremist group, government forces and pro-government Shiite militias.

He explained: 'Daily terrorist attacks perpetrated by ISIS continue to deliberately target all Iraqis.

'There also concerning reports of a number of revenge killings by armed groups in areas recently liberated from ISIS.'

Last year was the deadliest in Iraq since its 2006-2007 sectarian bloodshed, with a total of 12,282 people killed and 23,126 wounded, according to the UN.

7,Identity of ISIS terrorist known as 'Jihadi John' reportedly revealed,"Adding to Apple's iOS 8 launch troubles, a report on Monday claims the operating system's ""Reset All Settings"" feature for hardware wiping user preferences also deletes data stored in iCloud Drive.

As discovered by MacRumors, the issue presents itself when iPhone and iPad users attempt to reset preferences via the device's Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings option. The feature allows users to troubleshoot possible iOS issues by reverting all system settings back to factory baselines.

As OS X 10.10 Yosemite, and subsequently iCloud Drive, is not yet available for consumer download aside from Apple's public beta testing program, the effects on consumers are non-existent. However, with a large number of untrained public beta participants opting in to the service with iOS 8, the problem could become serious.

According to the report, one iPad user performed the reset and found his local iWork documents deleted, which consequently wiped those same documents from the cloud when the tablet synced to iCloud. It appears only data from first-party apps connected to iCloud Drive are affected by the bug, though not all users are seeing the issue play out as described.

In some cases, files are being delete upon syncing with iCloud, while other data remains untouched. It is suggested that users back up iCloud Drive documents to a local computer prior to performing the Reset All Settings operation.

iCloud Drive is Apple's solution to cloud storage, syncing and collaboration. The system allows seamless file transport and storage across iOS, OS X and Windows, while enabling advanced features like document editing, asset tagging and drag-and-drop data management.

8,Banksy 'Arrested & Real Identity Revealed' Is The Same Hoax From Last Year,"If you’ve seen a story floating around on your Facebook feed about Banksy getting arrested and exposed, don’t worry because Banksy is still anonymous and well. The hoax was the work of a “satirical” news site called The National Report — which I’m not linking because f*ck those guys — that makes up fake stories that sound like they could be ostensibly true, usually without a trace of actual satire, as filthy, filthy clickbait. It’s an awful yet unfortunately effective business model.

In a story which was published early this morning, The National Report claimed that Banksy was arrested in London by a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force and revealed to be a 35-year-old man named Paul Horner. The International Business Times did some quick fact checking and exposed the story to be a hoax:

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users $2.99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15-year-old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager’s house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4.

The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics, a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who, unsurprisingly since his previous stories include ‘Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month’ and ‘Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis’, has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism.

HAHA get it? It’s funny because it’s not true! I guess there’s some logic in there somewhere. It’s not even entertaining to see people share stories that come from places like the The National Report since they’re designed to trick — unlike when dumb people share stories from The Onion, which are designed to actually be satire.

9,British Aid Worker Confirmed Murdered By ISIS,"The British Islamic State militant who has featured in videos featuring the execution of Western hostages, known as ‘Jihadi John’, has been identified.

The man is Mohammed Emwazi, a young British man from West London who was known to British security services.

Security agencies did not disclose his name earlier due to operational reasons.

Emwazi is thought to have killed American journalist James Foley in a video released last August.

He is further believed to have featured in the videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and US aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter.

Emwazi is reported to have links with a former UK control order suspect who fled to Somalia in 2006 and has alleged links to the funding of militant group Al Shabab, which recently threatened to carry out terror attacks on London’s Oxford Street.

He is a computing graduate from Queen’s Park in West London, who traveled to Syria in 2012 and later joined the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS).

One of his friends told the Washington Post he had “no doubt” that “Mohammed is Jihadi John.”

10,Gateway Pundit,"A British rapper whose father is awaiting trial in Manhattan for a pair of US embassy bombings is a leading suspect in the barbaric beheading of American journalist James Foley, it was revealed on Friday.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary — who recently tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head — was among three Brits identified as possibly being the masked killer known as “John the Beatle.” Bary, 24, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on terror charges tied to the deadly 1998 bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Also under investigation are the brother of a British doctor once charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents, and a former gang member who converted to Islam and traveled to Syria, Britain’s Telegraph newspaper reported.

A dozen American counterterrorism experts are expected to fly to the UK “within days” to help identify Foley’s killer, Britain’s Daily Mail reported.

Former hostages held by ISIS have said he is one of several jihadists they nicknamed “the Beatles” due to their British accents, with two of his cronies referred to as “George” and “Ringo.”

Bary, who went to Syria last year to fight in its bloody civil war, has a build, skin tone and ­accent all similar to those of “John,” according to The Telegraph.

Before becoming a jihadist, he was an aspiring rapper from West London known as “L Jinny,” whose music was played on BBC Radio 1.

Bary also appeared in music videos posted on YouTube for songs titled “Overdose,” “Flying High” and “Dreamer.”

But he was reportedly radicalized by followers of firebrand ­Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and walked out of his family’s plush home in the Maida Vale district of London last year, saying he was “leaving everything for the sake of Allah.”

Earlier this month, he was seen in a photo posted to Twitter wearing camouflage clothing and a black balaclava while holding a severed head with his left hand — the same hand “John” is seen using to draw a knife across Foley’s throat in his execution video.

According to The Telegraph, Bary is on an official list of British jihadists who may be “John.”

Also on the list is Razul Islam, 21, the paper says.

In 2012, Islam’s two older brothers — including Dr. Shajul Islam, a suspended physician with England’s National Health Service — were charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents near the Syrian border with Turkey.

But the brothers were released last year after neither British journalist John Cantile nor Dutch photographer Jeroen Oerlmans appeared to testify against them.

Another suspect is Aine Davis, 30, a former drug dealer and gang member who The Telegraph said converted to Islam and flew to Syria to wage jihad.",discuss
11,"Woman detained in Lebanon is not al-Baghdadi's wife, Iraq says","An Iraqi official denied that a woman detained in Lebanon is a wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group, adding that she is the sister of a terror suspect being held in Iraq.

Wednesday's denial comes a day after Lebanese authorities said they are holding a woman believed to be al-Baghdadi's wife.

They said she was detained for travelling with a fake ID and had herself claimed that she is the reclusive extremist leader's spouse.

This file image made from video posted on a militant website purports to show the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, delivering a sermon at a mosque in Iraq

The statement by Iraq's Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maan Ibrahim adds to the confusion surrounding the identity of the woman and child who were detained about 10 days ago in northern Lebanon travelling with a fake ID.

Lebanese officials said the woman, Saja al-Dulaimi, is believed to be the wife of the reclusive IS leader. She was held by Syrian authorities and freed in a prisoner exchange with the Nusra Front, Syria's al-Qaida branch, earlier this year.

The interrogation of the woman was being supervised by Lebanon's military prosecutor.

It was unclear what would have brought the woman and child to Lebanon, where IS controls no territory and enjoys only small support in some predominantly Sunni Muslim areas.

On Wednesday, Ibrahim told The Associated Press that al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi national who traveled to Syria before arriving in Lebanon, is not al-Baghdadi's wife. He identified her as the sister of Omar Abdul Hamid al-Dulaimi, who is being held in Iraq as a terror suspect.

He added that al-Baghdadi has two wives but neither is named Saja al-Dulaimi. There was no immediate comment from Lebanese authorities.

In Lebanon, a military expert was killed and two others wounded Wednesday when a bomb they were about to dismantle near the border with Syria exploded, the army said.

The explosion comes a day after an ambush by suspected Islamic militants in the same area killed six soldiers and wounded one.

Interior Ministry spokesman Mansour al-Turki's comments were published Wednesday in the Saudi Al-Eqtisadia newspaper.

The video was released online this week by a group purporting to be IS supporters. It shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing at the driver. It identifies the target as Thomas Hoepner. It was not immediately possible to confirm the authenticity of the video.

The reports began circulating late yesterday around Twitter:


So far there's nothing substantiating all the buzz. Cuban media outlets have denied any news conference is scheduled, and the hype also comes ""suspiciously close"" to the actual death of Fidel Castro Odinga, the 41-year-old son of a Kenya opposition leader, as the Daily Mail reports.

13,"No, that high school kid didn't make $72 million trading stocks","The video was one of those viral sensations that tugs on your heartstrings and compels you to watch, because it defies your expectations and shows you just how kind and compassionate human beings can be. There was only one problem.

The video was a fake — at least according to a witness who says he was there while the YouTube hit, “How Does A Homeless Man Spend $100?” was filmed.

You have probably seen the video by now — if not, view it above. Posted by the prolific prankster Josh Paler Lin — whose other videos include “Sex In The Bathroom Prank” and “Rock Paper Scissors Hickey!” — the viral video purported to be a “social experiment” in which Paler Lin gave a homeless man identified as “Thomas” a hundred bucks in cash, then “secretly” filmed him as he spent the money.

The video was picked up by dozens of media outlets, including the Inquisitr, and in the week the clip has been on YouTube, has racked up more than 28 million views.

Why? Because Thomas spent his money not on booze or drugs, but on food. And not just for himself. He used the cash to purchase and distribute food to his fellow homeless people in Orange County, California.

While determining how much revenue any particular YouTube video creates is difficult, by many estimates a video can earn between $1,000 and $5,000 for each million views it accumulates.

That means Paler Lin may have grossed anywhere from $28,000 to $140,000 off this single video — in one week.

Perhaps more important, Paler Lin created a crowdfunding campaign along with the video, to raise more money for Thomas. That campaign has so far brought in about $130,000 in donations from people moved by the selfless acts Thomas performs in the video.

But in an interview posted on the site Vocativ on Tuesday, Taugan Tan Kadalim, who says he stumbled by chance across Paler Lin filming the video and witnessed the whole thing, calls the entire scenario “bull****.”

Kadalim, 26, says that he was there at Euclid Liquor & Market where he had just purchased a lottery ticket before walking across the street to his girlfriend’s apartment, and that what he saw made it clear that “Thomas knew he was being followed.”

Kadalim says he is a fan of Paler Lin and recognized the YouTube celebrity immediately.

He then watched as Paler Lin entered the liquor store and spoke with a clerk as Thomas waited outside. Only after Paler Lin returned, Kadalim told Vocativ, did Thomas enter the liquor store.

“He drove Thomas to the liquor store,” Kadalim told the site. “While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.”

Vocativ said its reporters corroborated the story with Kadalim’s girlfriend and brother, but calls to the liquor store went unreturned. Kadalim posted a comment to the video’s YouTube page the day the video went on line, saying quote clearly that Paler Lin drove Thomas to the store, but the comment went largely ignored.

Paler Lin, however, adamantly denied faking any part of the “homeless” viral video, telling Vocativ, “There is no way we’re making any of this up. This is real.”",unrelated
14,"Soon Marijuana May Lead to Ticket, Not Arrest, in New York","After campaigning on a promise to reform stop-and-frisk, Mayor Bill de Blasio is set to launch his most significant effort to address the issues raised by the policy. Law-enforcement officials tell the New York Times that soon the NYPD may issue tickets for low-level marijuana possession rather than making arrests. Under the de Blasio administration's planned changes to the city's marijuana policy, those caught with a small amount of weed would be issued a court summons, but avoid a trip to the police station. The shift could have a huge impact in black and Latino communities, as a recent study found those groups represented 86 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city this year.

The de Blasio administration is still working out the details, such as how much weed one could possess without triggering an arrest, and some are already unhappy with the proposed change. Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson, who announced this year that he would stop prosecuting small-scale marijuana possession cases, said that telling people to show up in a court room without arresting them may actually be worse for minorities.

""In order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system, these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review,"" Thompson explained. ""By allowing these cases to avoid early review, by issuing a summons, there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place. These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.""

16,Boko Haram Denies Nigeria Cease-Fire Claim,"ABUJA, Nigeria — The leader of Nigeria's Islamist extremist group dashed hopes for the release of 200 kidnapped girls Saturday, denying reports of a truce with the government.

In a new video message, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau says the schoolgirls have converted to Islam and married off. ""The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,"" he says, laughing.

The news goes counter to what the Nigerian government said nearly two weeks ago when it announced a cease-fire deal with the terrorist organization, raising hopes among the families of the kidnapped girls — who were taken from the northeastern Nigerian town of Chibok in April — that their daughters would soon be released.

But as the weeks dragged on with no sign of the kidnapped girls, hopes began to fade.

""I was very excited when I heard the news — I will finally reunite with my daughter,"" said Hamidah Amira, 36, whose 17-year-old daughter was kidnapped. But then desperation set in, especially as Boko Haram abducted dozens of young women and teenagers in northeast Nigeria and continued to launch attacks that forced hundreds to flee.

Despite those incidents, the government insisted negotiations with the Islamists were ongoing in Chad, as some began to raise doubts a cease-fire was even agreed upon by the group.

Martin Ewi, senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies' office in Pretoria, said he didn't think Boko Haram had agreed to a truce, citing the lack of public statements on the issue in the past two weeks.

""The government might be talking to one faction … and then you have the other factions which might not have bought into the idea of dialogue,"" he said.

Human Rights Watch estimates Boko Haram, whose name loosely translates as ""Western education is forbidden,"" has abducted around 500 young women over the past five years.

Although some girls managed to escape from the Islamists, the whereabouts and the fate of the rest of the young women are uncertain.

A recent Human Rights Watch report, based on interviews with victims and witnesses of Boko Haram abductions, offers rare insight into a series of physical and sexual abuses the girls suffer in captivity, including rape, forced labor and beating.

""We found that the Nigerian government has never interviewed these girls, never really found out or learned what they've gone through, never attempted to do any kind of investigations,"" said Rona Peligal, Human Rights Watch deputy director for the Africa Division. ""They were kind of left on their own.""

Chibok resident Solomon Ali is deeply critical of the government's handling of the situation since the beginning.

""We were disappointed that the government has done nothing to ensure these girls are released,"" he said, adding officials have failed to keep the community informed.

Outraged by the kidnappings and the atrocities committed by Boko Haram, the international community has urged the Nigerian government to step up its efforts to free the girls. Since April, a campaign under the motto ""Bring Back Our Girls"" went viral on social media.

Peligal says Nigerian authorities should do a better job responding to the Boko Haram threat and ensuring protection around schools.

""The government needs to better anticipate and plan for those kinds of abductions because they're continuing,"" she said. ""And the government should respond capably.""

Ewi worries the girls would not be freed unless the government yields to Boko Haram's demands to release some of their militants.

""You can't pursue military operations and still be hoping to release the girls alive,"" he said.

Analysts warn the situation is likely to get worse in the months ahead of the 2015 election. Earlier this week, President Goodluck Jonathan, who is under increasing scrutiny for his failure to locate the girls, confirmed he would be running for re-election.

""The Boko Haram issue has been indeed politicized, and I expect it would be further politicized as we get closer to the election,"" said Peligal.

In the meantime, Amira — like other moms — waits, while making a personal appeal to Boko Haram to release her daughter and the other girls.

""They should sympathize with us, not with the government,"" Amira said.

17,"No, Robert Plant Didn’t Rip Up an $800 Million Contract","Led Zeppelin fans will be disappointed to learn that there’s no reunion tour and a story that appeared in the Daily Mirror suggesting that Robert Plant ripped up an $800 contract for such a gig is false, according to the Guardian.

The reported tour was supposedly financed by Virgin founder Richard Branson, who wanted to turn one of his Virgin planes into a new iteration of “The Starship,” the jet​ the band used to tour in the 1970s. The group was to play 35 dates in three locales-- London, Berlin and New Jersey.

Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones had signed on. And the late drummer John Bonham’s son Jason was to play drums for the band. “It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it,” a source told the Daily Mirror. “When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock. There is no way they can go ahead without him.”

Turns out, the entire tale is “rubbish,” said Plant’s publicist to the Guardian, backing up what Page had said to the publication in September - a Zeppelin reunion was “[not] very likely.”",agree
18,N. Korea’s Kim has leg injury but in control,"You want a gold Apple Watch, you say? Then it's going to cost you... a lot. 

The vanilla variant of Apple's newest wrist-worn wearable device only costs $349. However, if you're willing to spend big cash on something that has the Apple logo on it, the company would be more than willing to accommodate. 

According to analyst John Gruber, the gold version of the upcoming device may cost about as much as the monthly salary of a middle-class worker in the United States. Gruber predicts that the gold Apple Watch would cost $5,000. The figure is basically just a guess. However, it's not an uneducated one. 

""Most people think I'm joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000. I couldn't be more serious,"" Gruber wrote in a blog post. ""The lowest conceivable price I could see for the Edition models is $1,999 -- but the gold alone, just as scrap metal, might in fact be worth more than that.""

Gruber claims that Apple told him that the gold version of the Apple Watch is made of solid 18-karat gold. It is not gold-plated. This caused him to revise his guess on the price of the device.  

He based his estimate on the going rate for solid gold watches from other manufacturers. Challenging people to find a solid gold watch that costs less than $20,000, he cited a leaked price list for Rolex from 2012. Luxury watch companies don't set prices for their products; they leave that to their authorized dealers. This means that the products on the price list may have ended up being sold for a higher price. In the list, an 18-karat gold Rolex had a price tag of $34,250.


Gruber suspects that the reason Apple has been mostly silent about the specs for the device is that they don't know what the capabilities of the finished product would be. 

""What does Apple Watch actually do? Or, rather, what does WatchKit allow? We don't know. And Apple is not talking, even off the record. One factor is that the software (and perhaps the hardware internals remain a work in progress). It is far from a finished product,"" he said. 

Aside from the gold version, Gruber also predicts a stainless steel version of the device that costs $999. It's not clear whether fancier variants of the device would be available with the sport version at launch. Nonetheless, the Apple Watch is expected to ship in early 2015.",unrelated

20,Tropical spider burrows under man's skin through scar,"Tonight — finally! — ESPN is going to have an in-depth discussion on the NFL's domestic violence problem. The discussion will feature the opinions of up to 11 men and zero women, in a remarkable showing of the exact flavor of dumb meathead that ESPN is so adept at that it should trademark.

The panel was ostensibly was conceived of and approved of by several people who get paid money to do their jobs. Their jobs creating television programs that are good and informative. They are bad at their jobs. A domestic violence panel involving 11 men and 0 women when women constitute the vast majority of domestic violence victims is neither good nor informative.

Understandably, this has upset many people with brains that they use to think rather than promote ESPN programming, including Esquire's Ben Collins. Collins has had about enough of ESPN's blatant NFL defense. He argues that ESPN's pre-Monday Night Football man only domestic violence discussion is even more insidious when you consider just how pathetically cowardly and craven the network is.

[...] you will not hear these words: ""Roger Goodell is a liar.""

You will not hear these words because ESPN has a $15.2 billion broadcasting agreement with the NFL. You will not hear these words because it would interfere with the amount of money both ESPN and the NFL can make.

You will not hear these words because ESPN is not a company in the business of journalism. It is an entertainment outlet that sometimes reports convenient, timely information to drive interest in future programming.

You will not hear these words because ESPN has intimidated its on-air staff into standing down against domestic violence.
What an excellent way for ESPN and the NFL to lead into October Domestic Violence Awareness Month.

[UPDATE: ESPN publicist Josh Krulewitz tells our sister site Deadspin that despite Esquire's report from the 26th, tonight's programming ""was never going to be"" a panel on domestic violence. Krulewitz says it's a ""regular episode of Countdown, hosted by Suzy Kolber.""]",unrelated
21,Boko Haram ceasefire ignored as violence flares in Borno state,"(CNN) -- Boko Haram laughed off Nigeria's announcement of a ceasefire agreement, saying there is no such deal and schoolgirls abducted in spring have been converted to Islam and married off.

Nigerian officials announced two weeks ago that they had struck a deal with the Islamist terror group.

The deal, the government said, included the release of more than 200 girls whose kidnapping in April at a boarding school in the nation's north stunned the world.

In a video released Saturday, the Islamist group's notorious leader fired off a series of denials.

""Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?"" Abubakar Shekau said. ""They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.""

Shekau slammed reports of their planned release.

""We married them off. They are in their marital homes,"" he said, chuckling.

The group's leader also denied knowing the negotiator with whom the government claimed it worked out a deal, saying he does not represent Boko Haram.

""We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,"" he said of the negotiator.

It wasn't clear when the video was made.

Mike Omeri, coordinator of Nigeria's National Information Centre, told CNN on Saturday that all these claims contradict those made in conversations in which the Nigerian government has been involved.

Omeri said Nigeria's government will do everything possible to verify the claims made in the video.

Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to the aide.

The ceasefire deal announced October 17 followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.

After the deal was announced, the aide said final negotiations on the girls' release would be completed at a meeting a week later in Chad.

That day passed without any signs of the girls.

Boko Haram a growing challenge

In the video, Shekau talked not of peace but of more violence -- promising more ""war, striking and killing with gun.""

This strategy appears to be playing out in parts of Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire. More people have been abducted and scores killed in recent weeks, including one attack a day after the ceasefire that left eight dead.

Days later, members of the Islamist terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria, residents said Thursday.

Heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted, residents said.

For its part, the Nigerian government isn't backing down.

Rather, it is stepping up its military campaign against militants and criminals in some parts of the West African nation, Nigeria's defense ministry said on Saturday.

The military claimed its airstrikes and ground operations have repelled attacks against civilians in Adamawa and Borno, two of the states in northeastern Nigeria that have been strongholds and frequent targets for Boko Haram.

Officials are ""studying"" the latest video, even as the military continues to recognize the talks aimed at assuring the release of the kidnapped schoolgirls, the ministry said.

Boko Haram, whose name translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the Hausa language, is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Like ISIS, it has ambitions for a caliphate, or religious state.

The group's attacks have intensified in recent years in an apparent show of defiance for the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the government.

As part of its insurgency, it has bombed schools, churches and mosques, kidnapped women and children and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

22,NBC's Tom Brokaw reportedly wants Brian Williams fired over fabricated Iraq helicopter story,"Macaulay Culkin has once again died — at least, according to a death hoax spreading online.

The troubled actor, who at one point was reportedly entrenched in heroin addiction that friends feared he had only months to live, is once again the subject of a hoax claiming that he was found dead in his Manhattan apartment.

News that Macaulay Culkin had allegedly died spread quickly on Facebook and Twitter, with users linking to a story on something called MSNBC.website.com (which is entirely separate from the real MSNBC). The report read:

Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.

Multiple unconfirmed reports say Culkin was found dead Friday afternoon in his Manhattan apartment after police responded to a wellness check requested by a family member.

At least one occupant of the Manhattan apartment confirmed the apartment belongs to Culkin but police have not confirmed the man’s identity at this time.

“The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today,” said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department.

It has been only a few months since the last hoax claiming that Macaulay Culkin is dead. The actor was also reported dead back in April, with Facebook users mourning his alleged death and even a memorial page popping up.

“At about 11 a.m. ET on Sunday (April 20, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away,” the report claimed. “Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.”

There are way more important things to talk about at the moment, and in the end what matters is that this image speaks to people, so the more it spreads the better it is.

My drawing was a spontaneous reaction, I didn't expect it would have such an echo. Ideas don't break, ideas don't die. Charlie became immortal yesterday and I hope that this terrible day will make us cherish and protect our freedom with even more wit and humour. I can only hope it will inspire people to use their pencils too and that there will be thousands of drawings like this very soon.

25,Rumor debunked: RoboCop-style robots are not patrolling Microsoft's campus,"Knightscope co-founder Stacy Stephens said rumors that its K5 security robots are roaming Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus are not true.

Sorry to rain on the rumor mill's parade, but RoboCop-style robots are not patrolling Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus.

The rumor took shape after California-based Knightscope showed off its K5 security robot at an event hosted at Microsoft, according to Knightscope co-founder and Vice President Stacy Stephens.

""So people started snapping photos,"" and all the sudden a number of news outlets were reporting the robots had been deployed at Microsoft's offices in Mountain View, Calif., Stephens said.

The 5-feet, 300-pound K5 looks like R2-D2 from Star Wars. They roam around with a slew of sensors, looking for trouble, sounding alarms and alerting live security guards.

Knighscope has built the security-guard-mimicking robot and it is trying out the technology with an undisclosed number of partners – but Microsoft is not one of those testers.

""Obviously we're right across the street so we would love them to be [a customer],"" Stephens said. ""But we have not deployed there.""

Stephens said he got a phone call from Microsoft this morning after the news broke.

""They said, 'Hey, this is really cool. We didn't know we were doing this.' I said, 'You're not,'"" Stephens said.

27,Christian Bale Exits Steve Jobs Movie (Exclusive),"The Islamic State released a video of its jihadists beheading American journalist James Wright Foley in Syria. The video is almost five minutes long and includes threats against President Barack Obama and the United States.
In the video, which was temporarily available on YouTube but has since been removed, the terrorists remind the audience Obama authorized military action against IS and replayed Obama’s press conference when he announced the airstrikes. To them the declaration is a “slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims.”
Foley then appears on his knees in an orange jumpsuit. He relays a message that the US government is his true killer. He addresses his family as well. The message is choppy, which gives the appearance that he is reading off cards placed in front of the camera.
His executioner speaks with what appears to be a British accent, saying many Muslims worldwide accepted IS and a war against IS is, in essence, a war against Muslims. The UK has been one of the Islamic State's most active targets of recruitment.
After he beheads Foley, he presents to the camera another journalist, Steven Joel Soltoff, who worked for Time and The National Interest. Soltoff was reported missing in the middle of last year. The executioner said America’s next move will determine IS’s next move in what appears to be a threat against the second journalist.
Foley was an independent journalist in the Middle East. In 2011, he was one of four journalists kidnapped by Qaddafi’s forces in Libya, of which he said in an interview with the Boston Globe, “You don’t want to be defined as that guy who got captured in 2011... believe that front-line journalism is important.” He spoke at Northwestern University about his experience in Libya.

28,Microsoft Tried Out Robot Security Guards on Its Silicon Valley Campus,"A British rapper whose father is awaiting trial in Manhattan for a pair of US embassy bombings is a leading suspect in the barbaric beheading of American journalist James Foley, it was revealed on Friday.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary — who recently tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head — was among three Brits identified as possibly being the masked killer known as “John the Beatle.” Bary, 24, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on terror charges tied to the deadly 1998 bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Also under investigation are the brother of a British doctor once charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents, and a former gang member who converted to Islam and traveled to Syria, Britain’s Telegraph newspaper reported.

A dozen American counterterrorism experts are expected to fly to the UK “within days” to help identify Foley’s killer, Britain’s Daily Mail reported.

Former hostages held by ISIS have said he is one of several jihadists they nicknamed “the Beatles” due to their British accents, with two of his cronies referred to as “George” and “Ringo.”

Bary, who went to Syria last year to fight in its bloody civil war, has a build, skin tone and ­accent all similar to those of “John,” according to The Telegraph.

Before becoming a jihadist, he was an aspiring rapper from West London known as “L Jinny,” whose music was played on BBC Radio 1.

Bary also appeared in music videos posted on YouTube for songs titled “Overdose,” “Flying High” and “Dreamer.”

But he was reportedly radicalized by followers of firebrand ­Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and walked out of his family’s plush home in the Maida Vale district of London last year, saying he was “leaving everything for the sake of Allah.”

Earlier this month, he was seen in a photo posted to Twitter wearing camouflage clothing and a black balaclava while holding a severed head with his left hand — the same hand “John” is seen using to draw a knife across Foley’s throat in his execution video.

According to The Telegraph, Bary is on an official list of British jihadists who may be “John.”

Also on the list is Razul Islam, 21, the paper says.

In 2012, Islam’s two older brothers — including Dr. Shajul Islam, a suspended physician with England’s National Health Service — were charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents near the Syrian border with Turkey.

But the brothers were released last year after neither British journalist John Cantile nor Dutch photographer Jeroen Oerlmans appeared to testify against them.

“The office is over-run and the Vogue staff is secretly whispering that the rats could be cosmic payback for Anna’s decision to put Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on the cover,” a Vogue staffer revealed. “There was so much backlash, and now this!”

Condé Nast and Vogue recently decamped from Times Square to the new digs at One World Trade Center, and the move has not gone off without a hitch.

“The famed accessories closet, which was being put together with the designer wares from the old office, was taking shape when the rats got into it,” the source revealed. “There were droppings all over the floor, and some of the shoe boxes had been chewed into.”

“The rats appear to have gotten in via the venting, which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in,” the source explained. “Walls were being moved to accommodate last-minute design changes by Anna and Condé Nast, and it’s assumed this is how the rats got in.”

But meanwhile, “It’s very unnerving to come to work in the morning, and find rat droppings on computers, and desks!” the source said. “Anna isn’t amused and top pest control experts have been hired to get the problem dealt with quickly.”

In August, Boko Haram declared an “Islamic state” in northeastern Nigeria, the Washington Post reported. Authorities believe the group is hiding the girls somewhere in that area. Jennifer Cook, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the longer the girls stay in captivity, the harder it would be to bring them home.

“With hostage situations with this many people, to bring one set back without endangering another set is very difficult,” Cooke told Time. “In some cases, there’s a pretty good idea of where they are, but extricating them from a group of armed criminals who have so little respect for life is a difficult negotiation process. And the longer they’re there, the greater likelihood they become dispersed, and the more difficult they are to track down.”

It's unclear how the girls have been treated during their captivity, raising questions about their health. “These girls are being held under absolutely horrific circumstances, subjected to sexual violence and rape, forced into servitude,” Cooke said. “There are reports that some have become pregnant.”",discuss
32,"TEXAS TURKEY FARM CONTAMINATED WITH EBOLA, OVER 250,000 HOLIDAY TURKEYS INFECTED","North Korea may have a woman at the helm–Kim Jong-Un’s sister Kim Yo Jong–according to a rash of rumors that have popped up recently.

There’s several pieces of the news, with some indicating that the dictator Jong-Un may no longer be in control of the country.

Jang Jin-sung, formerly a key member of Kim Jong-il’s propaganda machine, said recently that a powerful group of officials that once reported only to Jong-il have stopped taking orders from Jong-Un and now effectively run the country.

The group is called the Organization and Guidance Department, and some of them want to keep the status quo while others want to open up the market.

“On one hand, it’s people who want to maintain a regime monopoly,” Jang told VICE News through a translator.

“On the other hand, it’s not like people are fighting against the regime, but in a policy sense they want to take advantage to get influence. It’s not actually consciously civil war, but there are these two incompatible forces at play.”

The insight comes as Seoul-based think tank North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity says that Kim Yo Jong may be leading the country instead of her brother.

The NKIS says that Jong-Un is getting medical treatment for an unspecified illness, and that the extended treatment was actually decided upon at a high-level meeting in early September that was held at Yo Jong’s suggestion.

She’s now charged with handling important government decisions in his absence, according to the Diplomat, citing the report.

“All the important matters related to government administration should be reported to Kim Yo-jong, so that Kim Jong-un can concentrate on getting better,” the people at the meeting decided.

Yo Jong is the daughter of Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, and his wife Kim Yong-hui, and was first spotted in public in September 2010. She was officially mentioned for the first time on March 9, 2014, being identified as a “senior official” in the government.

Then again, perhaps Yo Kong is not in total control, according to Kim Heung-gwang, the head of NKIS.

“Some say Hwang Byong-so, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,” he said.

The possible leadership change comes amid reports of an attempted coup.

The waddling dictator has already opened branches of the Pyongyang restaurant in China and Holland – with some serving delicacies such as dog-meat soup and a bottled aphrodisiac allegedly made from bears.

Next to that lot, deep fried Mars bars and a national dish made from sheep’s bowels sounds positively delicious.

Kim is alleged to be eyeing up Scotland because of his love of whisky – which is so popular in his communist dictatorship it’s sometimes used instead of money.

The podgy autocrat also admires Alex Salmond’s attempt to break free of English control last year.

While that is something that Scots might be able to get on board with, it’s debatable whether they’ll share Kim’s taste in food, with Western Pyongyang outlets serving ‘delicacies’ such as pine nut gruel.

The key question may be whether Kim offers Irn Bru alongside the ginseng wine offered in other Pyongyang outlets.

Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch, said Jong-un is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

‘The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite’s thoughts.

‘Despite voting No’ they’d consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.’

One of the restaurants has already opened in Holland.

They are run in partnership with Office 39, a secretive branch of the North Korean government, which uses them as a legal way of raising overseas cash.

Mr Madden, a frequent visitor to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, added: “They are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.

‘They are done like a franchise with the state renting the brand out to other Koreans to run.

‘But they tailor the menus to suit. Customers in Western Europe won’t get a plateful of dog!’",unrelated
34,"Thanks Uncle Sam, we have your weapons airdrop: ISIS taunts America over intercepted weapons meant for Kurds","Longtime ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Tom Brokaw reportedly wants his successor, Brian Williams, thrown out of the big chair after he admitted fabricating key portions of a story he repeatedly told about his reporting experience during the Iraq War in 2003.

The New York Post, citing sources at the network, reported that Brokaw, 74, has been ""making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report.""

Brokaw was the anchor of NBC's flagship evening newscast when Williams filed his initial report in March 2003. In it, Williams described how he was traveling in a group of helicopters forced down in the Iraq desert. On the ground, Williams said, he learned the Chinook in front of him ""had almost been blown out of the sky""; he showed a photo of the aircraft with a gash from a rocket-propelled grenade.

Williams succeeded Brokaw as the ""Nightly News"" anchor following the 2004 presidential election, and his story evolved over time.

In a 2008 blog post, Williams said that his helicopter had come under fire from what appeared to be Iraqi farmers with rocket-propelled grenade. He said a helicopter in front of his had been hit.

Then, in a 2013 appearance on David Letterman's ""Late Show"" on CBS, Williams said that two of the four helicopters he was traveling with had been hit by ground fire, ""including the one I was in.""

On Wednesday, Williams recanted that story, claiming he was that he was flying in a Chinook helicopter behind the formation that took fire. However, on Thursday, the military newspaper Stars and Stripes, which broke the story, reported that Williams was actually flying with a different helicopter company altogether, in a different direction, and linked to the attacked unit only by radio.

Adding to the intrigue, the Post reported that Brokaw and former NBC News president Steve Capus, who left the network in 2013, knew that Williams' updated version of his tale was not true before the anchor's admission Wednesday evening. The paper also says NBC News executives had counseled Williams to stop telling the story.

Despite Brokaw's campaign, the paper says NBC will take no action against Williams, believing that his on-air apology Wednesday will suffice.

""He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way,"" one source told the paper. ""He has the full support of NBC News.""

A fisherman has reeled in a monster 19 stone catfish, which could be the biggest in the world caught with a rod and reel.

Dino Ferrari hooked the whopper wels catfish, which was 2.67m in length, last week in the Po Delta in Italy.

While the fish might set a new record for the biggest caught on a line, it is far from the heaviest ever landed. The biggest was 22st and 2.78m long, and was also from the Po Delta.

Wels catfish can grow as long as 4m and up to 62st. However, it is rare to catch one that is over two meters long.

ihadi militants in Syria say that US-led coalition air strikes have killed Kayla Jean Mueller, an American aid worker, who was being held hostage by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (known as Isis).
Social media sites used by the group said Ms Mueller, 26, was killed in coalition air strikes on the Isis stronghold at Raqqa, a city in northern Syria. Pictures posted online, however, offered no conclusive evidence of her death.
Isis supporters posted photographs from the group’s media wing showing a flattened building. “Rubble from the building which the American hostage Kayla Jean Mueller is buried beneath,” said the label of one picture.

Officials in Washington said they could not confirm the claim. “We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates Isil’s claim,” said Marie Harf, a state department spoksewoman.
Ms Mueller was captured by Isis more than a year ago along with a group of aid workers, all of whom have been released, probably by ransom. Isis was demanding millions of dollars for her release, but the US has a strict policy of rejecting ransom demands.
If Ms Mueller’s death is confirmed, she would be the eighth foreign hostage killed in Isis captivity, and the fourth American.
A statement attributed to Isis and posted online said the house where Ms Mueller was being held was on a site hit by strikes lasting more than an hour on Friday. Its authenticity could not be immediately verified.
“God thwarted their intentions and responded to their cunning. Not a single mujahid [holy warrior] was hit,” the statement said. “We have confirmation that the American prisoner was killed by its fire.”
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said that dozens of fighters were killed in the strikes, which focused on suspected Isis bases west of Raqqa.
Activists inside Raqqa said the area was pummeled by air strikes in what was widely perceived by locals as revenge strikes for the execution by Isis of Muath al-Kassaesbeh, a captured Jordanian coalition pilot. He was burned alive in a video that shocked his countrymen and triggered vows of an “earthquake of revenge” by Amman’s forces.
Jordan is one of the Arab countries participating in the US-led coalition against Isis. The coalition has been launching near daily air strikes against Isis territory, which spans about a quarter of both Syria and Iraq.
Isis supporters on Twitter, who posted the images of the destroyed building that allegedly housed Ms Mueller, taunted Jordan for the young captive’s alleged killing. “Bring on your revenge,” said one Isis follower.",unrelated
40,"At CBS Detroit, Fan Site 'Scuttlebutt' Is Enough to Publish Batmobile Rumor","ISLAMIC State group jihadists are being trained by Saddam Hussein’s former pilots to fly three fighter jets captured from the Syrian military, a monitoring group says.

The planes, which are believed to be MiG-21 and MiG-23 jets, are capable of flying although it is unclear if they are equipped with missiles, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The jets were seized from Syrian military airports now under IS control in the northern provinces of Aleppo and Raqa, according to the Britain-based group, which has a wide network of sources inside the war-torn country.

It said that former Iraqi army officers who once served under Saddam were supervising the training at the military airport of Jarrah, east of the city of Aleppo.

Witnesses have reported seeing planes flying at a low altitude to avoid detection by radar after taking off from Jarrah.

It comes as the US and its allies carry out a wave of air strikes on IS positions in Syria and Iraq.

The jihadists also control two other airports in Syria — Albu Kamal near the Iraqi border and Tabqa in Raqa province.

IS has captured large parts of Syria and Iraq, committing atrocities and declaring an Islamic “caliphate”.

After the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, some Sunni former officers from Saddam’s army joined the ranks of the Islamic State of Iraq, a branch of al-Qaeda which later became IS.

Meanwhile, sniper and mortar fire from jihadists are preventing authorities from evacuating civilians caught up in the battle for the Syrian border town of Kobane, a local official says.

At the same time, Kobane district chief Anwar Muslim, said US-led air strikes had destroyed many Islamic State group vehicles and artillery pieces, and that the town’s defenders are reinforcing their positions.

“There are civilians trapped in the centre and south of town, whom we cannot evacuate because of snipers and mortar fire,” Mr Muslim told AFP on Friday.

“Their situation is difficult.”

There are no precise figures on how many non-combatants remain in Kobane, also known as Ain al-Arab.

Last week, the United Nations spoke of as many as 700, mostly elderly, civilians being trapped in the centre of the town. Another 10,000-13,000 were said to be gathered near the Turkish border.

For its part, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says there are hundreds of civilians in the centre and west of town and that many of them refuse to leave, preferring to die than go into exile.

The IS jihadists, who have seized swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq and declared a “caliphate,” first attacked Kobane on September 16 in a bid to seal their control of a long stretch on the Syrian side of the border.

They succeeded in taking nearly half the town before its defenders, aided by US-led air strikes, began pushing them back.

Describing the situation on Friday, Muslim said “you can see their bodies (IS jihadists) in the streets ... Our forces are reinforcing their defensive positions.”

The IS fighters are “mostly in the east and south, and have hidden their Hummers, artillery and tanks among the houses so as not to be targeted by the air strikes.”

He saluted what he called the “incredible resistance” of Kobane’s defenders, adding that the situation is still dangerous and that there is “no other choice but to resist.”",unrelated

The CBI has registered a case against Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda, in connection with the alleged forced castration of 400 of his followers.

The agency has registered a case of criminal conspiracy against the Dera chief and his other followers for voluntarily causing grievous hurt with dangerous weapons, among other charges, under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) .

The case has been registered on the orders of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

A petition was filed in the high court in 2012 by a follower of Dera demanding a CBI inquiry and compensation for his alleged castration in 2000, CBI spokesperson Kanchan Prasad said.

Prasad added that petitioner Hansraj Chauhan has alleged that around 400 male devotees, including himself, belonging to Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, were castrated at the Dera after its head (Ram Rahim) falsely claimed that the castration would lead to “realisation of God through him”.

Justice K. Kannan of the high court passed the order on the petition ordering a CBI inquiry into the incident.

The court had earlier ordered a medical examination of the petitioner from the government multi-speciality hospital which found that he had indeed been castrated.

49,‘Banksy’ Instagram tribute to Charlie Hebdo victims not posted by artist,"Pentagon investigating claims but admits one load missing and it would be embarrassing if it ended up in terror group’s hands

A US airdrop of arms to besieged Kurds in Kobani appears to have missed its target and ended up in the hands of Islamic State (Isis) militants.

Video footage released by Isis shows what appears to be one of its fighters for in desert scrubland with a stack of boxes attached to a parachute. The boxes are opened to show an array of weapons, some rusty, some new. A canister is broken out to reveal a hand grenade.

The Pentagon said it was investigating the claim but admitted that one of its airdrops had gone missing. If confirmed, it would be an embarrassment for the US, given the advanced precision technology available to its air force.

The seemingly bungled airdrop comes against a steady stream of US-supplied weapons being lost to Isis forces, mainly from the dysfunctional Iraqi army. Isis is reported to have stolen seven American M1 Abrams tanks from three Iraqi army bases in Anbar province last week.

The Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral John Kirby, told reporters that analysts at Centcom headquarters in Tampa, Florida, were examining the video. “We’re still taking a look at it and assessing the validity of it,” he said. “So I honestly don’t know if that was one of the one dropped.”

The US began dropping munitions, supplied by Kurdish authorities in the semi-autonomous region of northern Iraq, to their compatriots in Kobani, which sits close to the Iraqi-Turkish border; Isis fighters have encircled much of the town.

Kirby confirmed the weapons shown in the video were the kind that were dropped. “So it’s not out of the realm of the possibility in that regard,” he said.

“I do want to add, though, that we are very confident that the vast majority of the bundles did end up in the right hands. In fact, we’re only aware of one bundle that did not.”

The airdrops were carried out by three C-130 planes. The video shows a man in camouflage clothes and balaclava looking through the boxes of munitions. He says they were dropped by US forces and had been intended for the Kurds. He described them as the spoils of war.

As well as grenades, the boxes appeared to contain parts for rocket-propelled grenades. Some of the equipment appears to be east European in origin, which might seem odd given the weapons were dropped by Americans, but the munitions were supplied by the Kurdish authorities who had been stocking up.

Kirby said the situation in Kobani remained tense, with Kurdish forces in control of most of the city. The US-led coalition has mounted more than 130 air strikes round the town in an effort to stop Isis taking complete control.

While the US has carried out air strikes in Kobani, cloud cover last week prevented them hitting much of the rest of Iraq, particularly around the contested Mosul dam. If the dam was to fall to I, it would provide huge leverage for the group, a strategic loss with potentially catastrophic consequences.

Britain has been supplying the Kurdish semi-autonomous region with weapons but so far supplies have been limited. The Kurds report receiving about 40 heavy machine guns but say they badly need heavier equipment, in particular armoured vehicles.",unrelated

But it's never had a true, physical retail store, at least not until now.

It'll be located on 34th Street, right between the flagship Macy's store and the Empire State Building.

In a way, the store will reportedly be just an extension of what Amazon already does in its physical spaces. Amazon will accept returns at the location, and will use it as a mini-warehouse particularly tuned for same-day delivery of products in New York. You'll also be able to pick up online orders at the store, meaning you'll be able to buy online and get items even faster. Amazon may also use the store to show off its Kindle and Fire products, which seems like a spectacularly obvious thing to do but is evidently still only being considered.

Of course, there's potential to do much more. Amazon's been building to this: the company launched a tool for identifying products, a card-reader for buying them, and much more that suggests it could quickly build a full-fledged physical retail space. It's been rumored for years that Amazon would do this, and even now Amazon tells the Journal that this is just an experiment.

The store is apparently slated to be open in time for the holidays, and could be the beginning of an entirely new branch of competition between Amazon and its biggest brick-and-mortar competitors.",unrelated
51,BREAKING NEWS: ISIS beheads missing American journalist James Wright Foley as warning to US to cease action in Iraq,"North Korean despot Kim Jong-un has been guzzling pint after pint of ‘snake wine’, with the body of a dead cobra in the bottle – in a vain attempt to restore life to genitals he may not have seen for years due to his vast bulk.

Locals believe that the meaty brew increases the size of a man’s manhood – and improves chances of pregnancy.

Kim has piled on enormous amounts of weight after bingeing on Emmenthal cheese and Johnnie Walker whisky, and the 31-year-old is struggling to father a child with his lucky young wife, Ri Joi-Su, 22.

Kim believes that glugging litres of wine, mixed with rotting flesh and venom could be just the ticket to restore his virility and father a sibling for daughter Ju-ae, two.

One South Korean ex-pat said, ‘The elite in the country joke that he is too big to please his wife and that’s why they do not have any other children.’

‘One senior official said that Kim was drinking many bottles of snake wine to help him in the bedroom department.’

Jong-un was first exposed to Emmenthal while studying in Switzerland as a young man, and his fondness for the cheese is said to have rapidly escalated into dependence.

His ballooning weight is thought to be a result of daily binges on the cheese, which is used in fondues, gratins, raclettes and sandwiches.

52,Nigeria and Boko Haram 'agree ceasefire and girls' release',"Someone displaying symptoms of Ebola, who apparently had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, showed up at a Care Now facility in Frisco, Texas, Wednesday afternoon, the Dallas Morning News reported. As of now, it's not a confirmed Ebola case.

“The patient claims to have had contact with the Dallas ‘patient zero.’ Frisco firefighter-paramedics are in the process of transporting the patient,” a statement from Dana Baird-Hanks, a spokeswoman with the city of Frisco, said.

Paramedics are reportedly transporting the patient, who has not yet been identified, to Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, the Morning News reported. Staff and patrons of the facility are being examined for the deadly virus.

Since Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola, there have been 5,000 false alarms in the U.S., Forbes wrote Wednesday. The Centers for Disease Controls said it received more than 800 calls a day regarding the deadly disease -- a drastic jump from the 50 calls a day it received before Duncan’s infection was known.

Duncan, the first person in the U.S. to become sick with virus, died Wednesday. “It is with profound sadness and heartfelt disappointment that we must inform you of the death of Thomas Eric Duncan,” said a statement from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where he was being treated. “He fought courageously in this battle.”

More than 3,400 people in West Africa have been killed by the latest outbreak. The virus might have been spread through handling “bushmeat,” which is the meat of African wild animals, and contact with infected bats.

53,Pope Francis turns out not to have made pets in heaven comment,"NEW YORK — Pope Francis has given hope to gays, unmarried couples and advocates of the Big Bang theory. Now, he has endeared himself to dog lovers, animal-rights activists and vegans.

Trying to console a little boy whose dog had died, Pope Francis told him in a recent public appearance on St Peter’s Square that “paradise is open to all of God’s creatures”. While it is unclear whether the Pope’s remarks helped soothe the child, they were welcomed by groups such as the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

In his relatively short tenure as leader of the world’s one billion Roman Catholics since taking over from Benedict XVI, Pope Francis, 77, has repeatedly caused a stir among conservatives in the church.

He has suggested more lenient positions than his predecessor on issues such as homosexuality, single motherhood and unwed couples.

Theologians cautioned that Pope Francis had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.

Reverend James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor-at-large of America, a Catholic magazine, said he believed that Pope Francis was at least asserting that “God loves and Christ redeems all of creation”, even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals. “He said paradise is open to all creatures,” Rev Martin said.

The question of whether animals go to heaven has been debated for much of the church’s history. Pope Benedict said during a 2008 sermon that when an animal dies, it “just means the end of existence on earth”.

Ms Christine Gutleben, senior director of the Humane Society, said Pope Francis’ apparent reversal of his predecessor’s view could be enormous. “If the Pope did mean that all animals go to heaven, then the implication is that animals have a soul. And if that is true, then we ought to seriously consider how we treat them because they mean something to God,” she said.

Ms Sarah Withrow King, director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA, one of the most activist anti-slaughterhouse groups, said the Pope’s remarks could move Catholics away from consuming meat. But there are differing views.

Mr Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, said in an email that it “certainly does not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin”. THE NEW YORK TIMES",disagree
54,British rapper a suspect in ISIS beheading,"Islamic State group fighters seized at least one cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town, activists said today.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

A still from an Islamic State (ISIS) video, purportedly shows an IS militant displaying the content of a crate carrying grenades near the town of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey border

A U.S. military airdrop of weapons meant for Kurdish fighters fell into the hands of their jihadist foes near the Syrian battleground town of Kobane, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said

The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

On Tuesday, ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.'

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Militant: Particular blackspots for ISIS checkpoints are the roads around the militants' strongholds in Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor, as well as a number of major highways in eastern Syria.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.

An American journalist has been killed in a car crash in Turkey just days after claiming she claimed the Turkish intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of Kobane.

Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'.

Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles.

Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'

Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network.

In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place.

Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally.

Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene.

Breaking News: Macaulay Culkin Found Dead at Age 34

Origins: On 6 November 2014, an online rumor claimed actor Macaulay Culkin, best known for his roles in the 1990s Home Alone films, had died. That rumor was based on a Facebook hoax memorial page set up for the star:

At about 11 a.m. ET on Thursday (November 06, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away.

Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.

The Facebook page memorializing the still-living star was soon taken down, but not before hundreds of thousands of social network users were duped by its claims. Culkin was photographed after the rumor began to circulate, alive and in the company of his bandmates:

56,A Husband Breaks Down In Tears After Lost Voicemail Message By His Late Wife Is Recovered,"Near Suruc, Turkey (CNN) -- Could ISIS fighters be training as warplane pilots capable of turning their weapons on coalition aircraft?

That's the worrying prospect suggested by an unverified report from the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights that ISIS has three warplanes in its possession in northern Syria.

The Syrian opposition group also claims, citing reliable sources in Syria, that former Iraqi military officers are training members of the Sunni extremist militant group to fly them.

The planes are at the Al-Jarrah military airport east of the contested city of Aleppo, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

The former Iraqi military officers are among those who have joined ISIS, and people living near the airport have said that they recently saw an airplane flying at low altitude after it took off, according to the Observatory.

Information on how the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which calls itself the Islamic State and is also known as ISIL, obtained the planes, or the trainees' previous level of familiarity with flight, wasn't immediately available.

CNN has not independently verified the report.

However, the U.S. Central Command sought to pour cold water on the report.

""We're not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,"" said spokesman Col. Patrick Ryder.

""We continue to keep a close eye on ISIL activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centers of gravity, wherever they may be.""

ISIS has captured large swaths of northern and eastern Syria, as well as parts of western and northern Iraq, for what it says is its new Islamic caliphate.

Kobani airstrikes target ISIS

This week has seen an increased number of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in the northern Syrian city of Kobani, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Aleppo.

The strikes are helping Kurdish fighters on the ground push back ISIS militants in the Syrian town, according to sources there.

The Pentagon said its increased focus on the area reflected greater opportunity rather than a strategic shift with regards to the importance of helping the Kurds hold Kobani.

""What makes Kobani matter for us from an airstrike perspective is that (ISIS is) there, and that they want it,"" said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman.

Retired Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt told CNN Friday that Kobani is not tactically or militarily very important -- but has taken on a certain significance.

""It's a small little town along the border with Turkey, he said. ""However, it has attracted the attention of the world.

""The world is watching the coalition fight ISIS and, because of that, a victory by either side in Kobani will have a psychological and strategic communication victory that far outweighs the tactical military victory to whichever side wins.""

In recent weeks, administration and U.S. defense officials have said it wasn't essential to keep the city, on the border with Turkey, from becoming the latest in Syria to fall into ISIS hands.

Anbar advances

Meanwhile, in Iraq's western Anbar province, ISIS militants have tightened their grip over an area about 15 miles south of Falluja, a provincial official said Thursday.

ISIS has brought many of its fighters, armed with heavy weaponry and machinery, in order to attack and control the town of Amiryat al-Falluja, the head of the town's council, Shaker Mahmoud, said Thursday.

Mahmoud urged the Iraqi government to send military reinforcements to support the security forces inside the town.

The deputy head of the Anbar provincial council, Falleh al-Issawi, told CNN by phone Friday that a curfew has been imposed on the city of Ramadi until further notice.

This was prompted by fear of potential suicide attacks by ISIS fighters, particularly during Friday prayers, he said. The curfew was imposed Thursday night.

Al-Issawi told CNN the situation in Ramadi was critical, with ""heavy clashes between Iraqi security forces and their supporters from one side and the ISIS militants from another.""

Car bomb attacks claimed by ISIS targeted Shia areas of Baghdad Tuesday, killing at least seven people and injuring more.

57,Bali Awry,"While Apple announced that the base model of its forthcoming smartwatch would cost $350, it's remained tight-lipped about the pricing of the rest of the range. Now, a new report suggests that the stainless steel version will start at $500, and the gold at somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000.

The report comes from sources at Apple via French website iGen.fr. As MacRumors points out, the site has been reliable in the past, accurately reporting the dimensions of both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

It's thought that the $350 price applies to the aluminum model of the watch. Certainly, $500 for the stainless steel version feels about right by comparison. The cost of the gold model, though; well, quite simply it depends on how much gold there is. We'll have to wait to find out, but such high pricing would indeed make it very much a luxury item.

The iGen.fr sources also claim that Apple is hoping to release the watch as soon as possible—though other rumors claim we may have to wait until Spring of 2015. Either way, we have longer to wait before we find out more than we'd like. [iGen.fr via MacRumors]",unrelated

Amazon seems to understand that all too well -- according to reports from CNBC and the Wall Street Journal, the e-commerce titan is gearing up to open its first brick-and-mortar store in midtown Manhattan in time for the holidays.

The move might seem a little out of character for a company like Amazon, but this isn't the first time it's thought about moving off of the internet and into meatspace. Two years ago, rumor had it that Amazon was going to open a physical shop in Seattle devoted to Amazon-exclusive books and its slew of Kindle gadgets. Oh, and who could forget those Amazon lockers you could choose to route your goodies to? Amazon's vision for its role in the real world has evolved a bit since then -- the Journal notes that the New York outpost could act as a way to highlight its own products like Fire TV, but the bigger draw is the space's role as a same-day product pickup location/customer service hub. Think about it: you'd be able to purchase something from Amazon and schlep down to the store on 34th Street to pick it up. Not exactly what you expected? You'd be able to return it to that very same spot. That sense of physical immediacy is something that Amazon has always lacked -- now we'll just have to wait and see if it's enough to warrant opening more of these things.

60,"No, it's not Tiger Woods selling an island in Lake Mälaren","A luxury island previously owned by Tiger Woods, the golfer, is up for sale.

The 62-acre island, in Lake Mälaren, Sweden, was the former home of the 14-time major winner and his ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, to whom he was married for six years.

It boasts six tee-off areas for a custom-made golf hole, features a secluded villa, a hunting lodge and its very own landing strip for propeller planes.

The island also includes a protected quay, private ferry boat, historic hill fort, pasture land for horses, stables and two small Skinnpälsarna islands with a water area of around 500 acres.

However, potential buyers will have to bring their own clubs as the main building does not come with furnishing.

Sabine Rollinger, of Vladi Private Islands, which is listing the island, said: ""This island was owned by Tiger Woods, but after his divorce he doesn't need an island in Sweden any more.

""This is a unique, exclusive private island with total privacy. It includes a private harbour, untouched woods, beautiful lush parks, open fields, striking lake views and a tastefully designed main residence, a mini-mansion.

""Also on the island is a landing strip and six tee-off areas for golf practice. The secluded villa, hunting lodge and stables are located on the main island and surrounded by a very large lawn.

""Here you can land your private prop airplane, play soccer, do some riding or enjoy unstructured golfing.

""A hundred metres from the villa is the private, protected bay, and a 50-metre long quay that provides plenty of space for your own, and your friends' boats.

""This is the place to begin great fishing trips in your own private fishing waters, take a boat ride out to Mälaren's over 1,000 islands or the beautiful archipelago of Stockholm.

""This island is also unique due to its central location as the Swedish capital is only about an hour away by boat or car, and from there you have swift access to the Stockholm archipelago.

""The property even has a historical 11th century Viking stronghold, a dramatic landscape with approximately 30 metres high rocks rising out of the lake.

""The island boasts a variety of wildlife, such as deer, hares and beavers - even elks can be seen on occasion.

""The protected location, combined with the quay's generous dimensions, make it an ideal place for private parties and outdoor dining.

""You go for a swim in Lake Mälaren, where the water reaches temperatures of up to 26C in the summer.

61,"Why the Gold Apple Watch Edition Must Cost $10,000","A previously unverified audio recording that allegedly captures the final moments of Michael Brown’s life has been verified as authentic, according to the video streaming application it was recorded on.

A resident living in the apartment complex where Brown was killed was using a video messaging app called Glide at the time of the shooting and unwittingly captured the sound of gunfire, according to a lawyer representing the resident, whose identity has not been released.

The recording suggests nearly a dozen shots were fired in an altercation between Brown, who was unarmed at the time, and Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

According to Glide the recording was created at 12:02 p.m. CT on Saturday Aug. 9, precisely the time police say Brown was shot.

“A Glide user living nearby (whose identity is being protected) was simply using the Glide app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed – to instantly communicate with a friend through our real-time video texting service. Simultaneously, they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown,” Glide said in a statement released on Thursday. “Because Glide is the only messaging application using streaming video technology, each message is simultaneously recorded and transmitted, so the exact time can be verified to the second.”

The lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, said she has shared the recording with the FBI. Federal officials won’t confirm they have this specific recording, but do confirm they are collecting any audio and video of the incident. 

The audio could prove to be critical piece of evidence in the ongoing investigation into Brown’s death. It also seems to confirm what some witnesses to the shooting say happened during the incident.

They said Brown, who was black, and Wilson, who is white, were seen struggling through the driver’s side window of Wilson’s police car. They said Wilson fired a single shot from inside his car and then fired several more as Brown attempted to flee. Some witnesses, viewing the incident from different vantage points, have said Wilson fired several shots at Brown and that at some point the boy turned around with his hands up, at which point Wilson fired several more gunshots.

The audio does not capture what happened just moments before or after the shooting. And law enforcement officials say that at this stage it’s impossible to know what the significance of this tape may be.

Days before the release of the audio earlier this week, Tommy Chatman-Bey, who lives in the Canefield Green Apartment complex near where Brown was killed, told msnbc that he was outside at the time of the shooting and was an ear-witness.

“I was right out there when I heard it,” Chatman-Bey said. “I heard Boom, Boom, Boom, pause, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom and then some more.”

The police have not provided many details about the shooting and have not released a detailed police incident report. What Ferguson police have released is a report with little more than the date, time and location of the incident. But more curious are the time stamps on the document. Typically an incident report following a homicide would give a detailed account.

The report, released only after the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri sued under open records law, suggests a supervisor had not reviewed it until Aug. 19, 10 days after the fatal shooting. Final sign-off wasn’t given until Aug. 20, the report appears to indicate.

Glide in their statement said, “While tragedy is never good news, and our hearts go out to the family of Michael Brown, this incident underscores how technology is changing the landscape of not only journalism, but also criminology. We commend this Glide user for turning their Glide video message over to FBI investigators as possible evidence in this ongoing investigation.”

A key question could be why Wilson paused in the midst of the barrage.

Brown was struck with at least six bullets including two that hit his skull, according to an autopsy performed at the behest of Brown’s family. Lawyers for Brown’s family have been critical of what forensic examiners identified as the two head shots that actually killed Brown. At least one of the shots struck Brown at the top of his head. Witnesses claim that as Brown fell to his knees and attempted to surrender to Wilson that the officer continued to walk toward him, firing several more shots.

St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch began presenting evidence in the case to a grand jury last week and said a decision on whether or not Wilson will be charged may not come until October.",unrelated

He also gave a tentative time-frame as to when Apple Pay will be reaching Europe. Also, analysts have predicted what Apple might offer at the time of its smartwatch launch.

While we already know that Apple Watch will be water resistant, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple further confirmed it as shower-proof, while chatting with a Kurfurstendamm Apple Store (Berlin) employee. Reported by iGen (via 9to5Mac), the CEO said that he always wears the watch - ""even in the shower"". Cook added that he puts his Apple Watch on charge every night, which reconfirms the expected battery life from Apple's previous statements and multiple reports.

Regarding Apple Pay, Cook said that the firm plans to bring the service to Europe not ""before the end of the year."" The announcement is somewhat a contradiction to announcements by UK banks, which in the recent past stated they were in talks to bring the Apple Pay system by the first half of 2015. According to Cook, the mobile payment system should reach Canada as soon as next month.

Meanwhile, Trip Chowdhry, an analyst from Global Equities Research has predicted that Apple might introduce as many as 100,000 apps for the Apple Watch by time it gets launched. The huge number comes from six ""Apple Watch-Kit hackathons"" in the past few months, which Chowdhry attended, according to a Barrons blog post.

He further states that the $350 (roughly Rs. 21,700) price tag for the smartwatch seems to be no issue because ""On an average an Apple Watch user will have 100 Apps installed, and one way to think about it is that the consumer is getting 100 devices for $350..i.e. $3.50 (roughly Rs. 217) per device,"" considering each app and its function as a single device.

As for the sales, Apple is being expected to ship almost 42 million units by December this year.

65,Amazon's first brick-and-mortar store said to open in Manhattan,"New audio has surfaced that allegedly captures the moment when Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot dead by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, on Aug. 9.

CNN aired the unverified recording on Monday night. Six shots can be heard, followed by a pause, then several more. A private autopsy performed on Aug. 17 at the request of Brown's family found that the 18-year-old was shot 6 times, including twice in the head.

A man who lives near the scene of the shooting says he inadvertently recorded the shots that killed Brown, his lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN. The man, who wished to remain unidentified, was recording a video chat with a friend when gunfire rang out in the background. Blumenthal said her client has already been interviewed by the FBI about the recording.

Brown was shot on Aug. 9 after he and a friend, Dorian Johnson, were walking in the street and were stopped by Wilson. Johnson, said that Wilson attacked Brown, then shot at the 18-year-old as he was trying to get away. Ferguson Police claim that Brown attacked Wilson, and said that Wilson was injured after the altercation. Multiple witnesses have said that they saw Brown with his hands up in the air when he was shot.

Police released footage on Aug. 15 that they said showed Brown robbing a convenience store for cigarillos. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that Wilson was not aware that Brown was a suspect in a robbery when he stopped the teen, though Jackson later said that Wilson ""made the connection"" during the course of the stop. The family's attorney accused police of trying to ""assassinate the character of Michael Brown"" to divert attention from his death.",unrelated
66,Did Kim Yo-Jong Take Kim Jong Un’s Role? North Korea Ill Health Rumors Are ‘Fabricated’,"Tonight — finally! — ESPN is going to have an in-depth discussion on the NFL's domestic violence problem. The discussion will feature the opinions of up to 11 men and zero women, in a remarkable showing of the exact flavor of dumb meathead that ESPN is so adept at that it should trademark.

The panel was ostensibly was conceived of and approved of by several people who get paid money to do their jobs. Their jobs creating television programs that are good and informative. They are bad at their jobs. A domestic violence panel involving 11 men and 0 women when women constitute the vast majority of domestic violence victims is neither good nor informative.

Understandably, this has upset many people with brains that they use to think rather than promote ESPN programming, including Esquire's Ben Collins. Collins has had about enough of ESPN's blatant NFL defense. He argues that ESPN's pre-Monday Night Football man only domestic violence discussion is even more insidious when you consider just how pathetically cowardly and craven the network is.

[...] you will not hear these words: ""Roger Goodell is a liar.""

You will not hear these words because ESPN has a $15.2 billion broadcasting agreement with the NFL. You will not hear these words because it would interfere with the amount of money both ESPN and the NFL can make.

You will not hear these words because ESPN is not a company in the business of journalism. It is an entertainment outlet that sometimes reports convenient, timely information to drive interest in future programming.

You will not hear these words because ESPN has intimidated its on-air staff into standing down against domestic violence.
What an excellent way for ESPN and the NFL to lead into October Domestic Violence Awareness Month.

[UPDATE: ESPN publicist Josh Krulewitz tells our sister site Deadspin that despite Esquire's report from the 26th, tonight's programming ""was never going to be"" a panel on domestic violence. Krulewitz says it's a ""regular episode of Countdown, hosted by Suzy Kolber.""]",unrelated

68,US confirms death of Somalia terror group leader,"LAS VEGAS -- The person behind the $300,000 dinner at Bellagio’s Prime Steakhouse has been revealed.

Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Vice Media Inc. CEO Shane Smith sprung for the dinner following a lucky run at the casino’s blackjack tables. Bloomberg said its source was a person who asked not to be identified because the meal was private.

On Tuesday, MGM Resorts International Chairman Jim Murren cited the dinner bill as an “encouraging sign” that Las Vegas visitors were eager to spend money again. He said the dinner was for a party of more than a dozen people at the upscale Prime and included wine with a price tag upward of $15,000 per bottle.

A guest at the dinner, who asked not to be identified, told Bloomberg the dinner party was closer to 25.

Murren said he hadn’t seen a check like that since 2007.

Bloomberg termed Brooklyn-based Vice a media titan that “has grown from a free, whiskey-stained Montreal monthly.” Technology Crossover Ventures and A+E Networks each invested $250 million for 10 percent stakes in the company last year.

Smith is 45 and, according to Gawker, gave $1 million to Vice’s staff at last year’s holiday party.

69,Durex Is Not Making Pumpkin Spice Condoms After All: A Hoax Debunked,"A spokesman for the Iraqi health ministry denied reports in a local newspaper that militants in Mosul had Ebola

Reports that Isis fighters in Iraq have contracted Ebola have been refuted as “incorrect” and “unfounded” by the country’s health ministry.

Despite reports on Wednesday in the Iraqi paper, al-Sabah, that two cases of Ebola had been reported in Mosul in the north of the country, Ahmed Rudaini, the health ministry’s spokesman dismissed the speculation.

He said the disease could not have been registered, as only the Central Laboratory of Public Health in Baghdad has the “diagnostic capabilities” to confirm cases of Ebola which was reported by the al-Maalomah news website and the International Business Times.

The World Health Organisation also confirmed that they had received no confirmation of Ebola cases from Iraq.

Tarik Jasarevic from the organisation told The Independent: ""WHO is aware of these reports and is working closely with Iraqi MoH to get more information.

""It is unlikely that this case can be a confirmed Ebola case as there is no laboratory facility in Mosul that could do an Ebola test.""

WHO’s director of communications, Christy Feig had earlier told Mashable: “We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.”

The organisation has reached out to the Iraqi government to investigate the claims, should it require assistance, however.

Al-Sabah initially reported that “terrorists” from several unnamed African countries had brought the virus to the country and claimed that two cases of Ebola and 26 cases of HIV/AIDS had been registered by authorities.

Although Isis has recruited foreign fighters in the past, it believed that the majority came from Tunisia, according to a Washington Post report. Very few, if any, militants are thought to have travelled from at-risk areas of West Africa, including Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

The northern city of Mosul fell to Isis six months ago and residents have suffered brutal repression. People are restricted from leaving the city without first nominating a guarantor, water and food supplies are limited and hospitals have been closed due to a lack of electricity.",unrelated

72,Indian civil servant sacked 'after 24-year sickie',"An Indian public official has been sacked for taking leave 24 years ago and never returning to his desk in the country’s notoriously work-shy bureaucracy, the urban development ministry said.

Assistant executive engineer A.K Verma went on leave in 1990 after joining India’s central public works department (CPWD) a decade earlier.

Verma defied bosses’ orders to return to work after his requests for additional leave were denied.

“He went on seeking extension of leave, which was not sanctioned, and defied directions to report to work,” the government said in a statement on Thursday.

Even after an inquiry found him guilty of “wilful absence from duty” in 1992, it took another 22 years and the intervention of a cabinet minister to remove him, the government said.

Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu ordered his dismissal in order to “streamline the functioning of CPWD and to ensure accountability,” it said.

India’s civil servants have long been notorious for arriving late, taking long lunches or spending parts of their day on the golf course.

A 2012 survey by the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk consultancy rated India’s bureaucracy as the worst among major Asian countries.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he was shocked by what he saw in the corridors of power after moving to New Delhi following his landslide election victory in May last year.

During his first few months in office, Modi developed a reputation for paying unannounced visits to government offices.

Fear of being caught playing truant triggered a rise in attendance levels among civil servants and Delhi’s main golf course has reportedly been largely deserted on week days.",agree

76,Biological Warfare on the Horizon? ISIS Soldiers May Be Infected With Ebola,"A hallucinogenic fungi has been found growing in the Queen’s garden at Buckingham Palace after being discovered by gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh.

The television presenter unearthed the fungi at Buckingham Palace for an ITV gardening show called The Queen’s Garden, and said: “I won’t be eating any of that.”

Titchmarsh came across the red and white spotted toadstool — called Amanita muscaria, or fly agaric — on a tour of the private 40-acre plot with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley.

Titchmarsh, 65, asks in an ITV show to be screened on Christmas Day: “Is it edible?”

Professor Crawley replies: “That depends what you mean. It’s eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic affects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

“The old-fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness.”

Titchmarsh jokingly replies: “I think I’ll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms.”

Then he adds: “Not something to try at home.”

Later he told The Sun newspaper: “That was a surprise but it shows just how varied the species are. I won’t be eating any of that, though, no. My idea of hard drugs is Nurofen.”

On the new TV show, Titchmarsh explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools.

He says: “Every time they chop something down, they leave out the wood to rot.”

Magic mushroom is a slang term for any hallucinogenic fungus.

The most common, illegal form contains drug psilocybin, but there is no suggestion this grows in the Palace garden.

Last night a Palace spokesman told the Sun: “For the avoidance of doubt, fungi from the garden are not used in the Palace kitchens.”

The new programme will show viewers an entire year in the life of the Buckingham Palace garden, from the summer garden parties to the nocturnal wanderings of wildlife in the heart of London.

It will demonstrate how gardeners work tirelessly to maintain the Queen’s flowers, while bearing in mind her wish to see animals and insects made welcome in the gardens, swapping pesticides for homemade garlic treatments.

Titchmarsh will explore how bee hives, homes for insects and deposits from the Royal mews each help cultivate the gardens of Buckingham Palace, with top tips from gardeners giving insight into the Queen’s own tastes.

The programme, to be broadcast by ITV on Christmas Day, will also show how the garden has been used by the royal family for generations, from the king who planted mulberry trees to rival the French to the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret climbing to peer over the high garden walls.

A sandpit used by the royal children will be filmed, along with oak trees planted decades ago by the young Prince of Wales and Princess Royal, grown from acorns sown on the event of their birth.

Titchmarsh, who spent 12 months exploring how the Palace garden changed with the seasons, will be seen finishing the calendar year with a Christmas tree mounted in the Marble Hall, decorated with holly and mistletoe from the royal garden and festooned with festive golden crowns.",unrelated
77,Moment Michael Brown was shot dead 'caught on audio recording': FBI handed potentially damning tape of ELEVEN shots being fired - including final volley of 'kill shots',"FERGUSON, St. Louis (CNN) — Could a newly released audio provide more clues on what led up to Michael Brown’s shooting death?

The FBI has questioned a man who says he recorded audio of gunfire at the time Brown was shot by Ferguson police on August 9, the man’s attorney told CNN.

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots — a cluster of six, followed by four.

“I was very concerned about that pause … because it’s not just the number of gunshots, it’s how they’re fired,” the man’s attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN’s Don Lemon. “And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.”

The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots, his attorney said.

He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

The attorney said she learned of the man’s recording late last week from a mutual friend.

“I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,” Blumenthal said.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording.

The meaning of the pause

It’s difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.

“It’s the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless — he has no weapon,” said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn’t automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

“To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,” said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN’s Crossfire. “Maybe the officer will say, ‘Well I fired, and he kept advancing, so I fired again.'”

Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown’s death.

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown’s who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away.

According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a friend of Wilson said Brown mocked the officer and charged at him before the shooting began.

An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown’s body.

Key witness speaks out

Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience storeshortly before the shooting.

And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that including lying to police has put Johnson’s credibility in question.

In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address.

Johnson said Monday night he doesn’t understand why some are questioning his credibility.

“I see they bring up my past, my history, but it’s not like it’s a long rap sheet,” Johnson told Lemon. “This one incident shouldn’t make me a bad person.”",discuss
78,Saudi fatwa banning snowmen triggers heated debate,"Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured. Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page. The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story ""mere propaganda"". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible. Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting. Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north. Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg's status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet.

Among the interesting details is the existence of an unannounced ""Power Reserve"" mode for the watch that will display only the time and cut off all other functions as the battery begins to run critically low, preserving the most basic functionality of the watch. The report also notes that while the Apple Watch has been widely tested by Apple employees, the company did work to conceal many of those prototypes by disguising them to resemble Samsung smartwatches.

Sources have also provided more context to a Wall Street Journal article from last month that discussed how many of the originally planned health features for Apple Watch were dropped due to consistency issues. According to The New York Times' sources, the decision to drop many of those features came more than 18 months ago, refuting off-target reports in recent weeks claiming the cuts have come at the last minute.Nearly two years ago, the company experimented with advanced health monitoring sensors that tracked blood pressure and stress, among other variables. Many of those experiments were abandoned more than 18 months ago after the sensors proved unreliable and cumbersome, these people said.

Apple long ago decided that for the first version of the product, it would include a heart rate sensor and a sensor for tracking movement, to market the device as a fitness-tracking companion to the iPhone. Previous reports have indicated Apple is still working on those technologies, and they could appear in future versions of the Apple Watch.

Today's report reveals some additional insight into the development process, noting that the Apple Watch is coming a bit later than originally hoped due to technical challenges that were likely exacerbated by the loss of several engineers working on the project. Google's Nest Labs, headed by iPod pioneer Tony Fadell, was responsible for poaching several of the key Apple Watch employees.

Apple's media event will take place at 10:00 AM Pacific Time on Monday, March 9 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. The company will offer a live video stream of the event, and MacRumors will provide full coverage of the event.

Witnesses in the Canadian capital, Ottawa, say the gunman then ran into the main Parliament building, where dozens of shots were fired.

Ottawa Police say ""a male suspect has been confirmed deceased."" It's unclear whether that suspect was killed at the Parliament building.

During a press conference, Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said this is still an ""ongoing investigation"" and asked ""people to stay away from [Ottawa's] downtown core.""

Bordeleau was asked if police are still looking for another suspect, but he would only say that authorities are sweeping Parliament Hill to make sure it is safe.

This hour, Parliament remains locked down.

This is a breaking news story. We'll update once we know more. And as we always tell you when stories like this are developing, information may come in that later turns out to have been incorrect. We'll do our best to sort through what's out there and reliable and update as needed.

In a press release, Ottawa police say today's incident happened near the National War Memorial and on Parliament Hill only.

Earlier, there were reports that shots were fired near Rideau Centre Mall.

According to Ottawa Police, the shooting started at the National War Memorial, where one soldier was killed. There was another shooting incident at Parliament and police say one male suspect was deceased.

Earnest said Canada is one of the United States' ""closest friends and allies,"" and administration officials have been in touch to offer any support.

Earnest was asked if this was a terrorist attack, and he said he was not in ""a position to render judgement on that at this point.""

Update at 1:33 p.m. ET. Multiple Shots Heard:

CNN interviewed Peter Henderson, who said he was locking his bicycle near the memorial when the initial shooting took place.

""I heard four shots, turned around and saw the soldier laying on the ground,"" Henderson said.

""People fled Parliament by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, witnesses told the Canadian Press news agency,"" The Associated Press relays.

81,Everyone chill! Banksy has NOT been arrested,"Amidst all the fist-pumping and Bono-goofing yesterday, one piece of information was conspicuously absent: The Apple Watch's battery life. What's the point of strapping a tiny computer to your body if it needs constant charging? According to Re/code, even Apple hasn't quite figured out the battery dilemma yet.

After Tim Cook mentioned charging Apple Watch ""every night"" on stage, John Paczkowski confirms today that a source within Apple pins the charge-by date at nightly—which would imply that the Apple Watch has a battery life of less than a day. Apparently, Apple is still working to improve that number before release. ""We anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging,"" an Apple spokesperson told Paczkowski, seemingly confirming the source.

This isn't just Apple's problem. As a paradigm, smartwatches still have quite a few kinks that need working out before they'll seem truly functional—and battery life is one of the biggest. On Monday, Gizmodo's Brent Rose reported that the Moto 360's battery life, while not as bad as expected, was only about 24 hours.

That's not terrible, but it does present some problems from a user experience perspective. The main selling point of many smartwatches is that they will constantly track your activity, from sleeping to working out. If your device needs to be charged for even a few hours every day, that's lost data, as information designer Nicholas Felton pointed out yesterday on Twitter:

Also sad that the watch charging solution means unbroken health stats are impossible. Not necessary for everyone, but important for many.

Sure, not everyone cares about tracking things like REM cycles. Not everyone will mind taking off their watch for a few hours every day.

A video published Tuesday by the extremist group ISIS showed Foley being beheaded. It is not known when or where the video was recorded.

For Foley's family and friends, the recording was the answer they hoped they'd never hear to their questions about his disappearance.

""We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,"" his mother, Diane, said Tuesday night,

She called him ""an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person.""

Courageous, generous

Foley was the oldest child of Diane and John Foley of Rochester, New Hampshire. He had four siblings.

Foley -- Jim to his friends -- had been reporting from war-torn countries for the better part of four years when he disappeared in Syria.

On Tuesday, fellow journalists remembered him for his courage and his generosity.

One of his friends, Alex Sherman of Bloomberg News, wrote on Twitter that he was a ""funny, warm, Big Lebowski-loving guy.""

Another friend, Max Fisher of Vox, praised his ""dedication to truth and understanding.""

Fisher also wrote that ""Jim's faith was something we all agreed not to discuss publicly while he was held in Syria, but it was the wellspring of his generosity,""

He recalled how Foley helped to organize a memorial fund for a photographer, Anton Hammerl, who was killed in Libya in 2011.

Foley had been traveling with Hammerl and two other journalists at the time, and the three who survived wound up in a Libyan jail.

Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors

Front-line journalist

Foley was freed six weeks later. Afterward, in a video interview with the Boston Globe, he hesitated to make the story about himself, remarking at one point that ""you don't want to be defined as 'that guy who got captured in 2011.'""

""I believe that front-line journalism is important, you know -- without these photos and videos and first-hand experience, we can't really tell the world how bad it might be,"" he said.

One of the journalists detained with Foley in Libya, Clare Morgana Gillis, said his fundraising for Hammerl's family was ""the same impulse that compelled him to cut short his much-needed break from reporting in Syria when a colleague went missing last summer, and to raise money for an ambulance for Aleppo's Dar al-Shifa field hospital, where he spent weeks filming the plight of doctors who struggled to save lives with minimal space equipment.""

His time as a teacher

For Foley, these were acts of service, not entirely unlike his time spent in the Teach for America program. He began teaching in Phoenix in 1996.

""He'd promise students that he'd take them to the Castles and Coasters amusement park if they would come to class everyday,"" a fellow Teach for America alum, Sarah Fang, recalled in an essay in 2013.

Foley later ""taught reading and writing to inmates at the Cook County Sheriff's Boot Camp in Chicago,"" according to a Columbia Journalism Review feature about him.

Would you watch the video?

His journalism career

In the mid-2000s he decided to pursue a journalism career, first by enrolling at Northwestern University's well-respected Medill School of Journalism and then by embedding with American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. While preparing for his first embed, he started his blog.

Foley freelanced for a number of news media outlets, including GlobalPost, a world news Web site founded in 2009.

In 2012, he gravitated toward the spiraling conflict in Syria.

Fang, who kept in touch with Foley after their years teaching in Phoenix, wrote that his interest in the story there did not surprise her.

""He's always been willing to step into a zone where no one else wants to go,"" she wrote. ""Jim feels that society needs reporters willing to bear witness and report back the facts of history-in-the-making. And his loyalty to his colleagues meant that he wanted to be there with them on the frontlines.""

BuzzFeed Middle East correspondent Sheera Frenkel said she last saw Foley about a week before his final trip into Syria.

Drinking beers at the lobby of a hotel popular among journalists, they talked, she said, about ""how hard it was to move on from this job, into a life which would allow for marriage and family.""

""He was a generous colleague, never holding back a tip, phone number, or detail that could help, and could spend hours talking over the ins and outs of a story to get it just right,"" Frenkel wrote in an email message.

""Jim was a great journalist, and I think he'd like to be remembered that way, first and foremost.""

After the news of Foley's killing spread on Tuesday, CBS News foreign correspondent Clarissa Ward changed her profile picture on Twitter to a photo of Foley wearing a helmet, a flak jacket and holding up a camera.

This, she said, ""is how I will chose to remember James -- as a brave and tireless journalist with a passion for the Syrian cause.""

83,New Audio Shows Michael Brown Was Shot at 11 Times,"Apple may be planning to hold a special event during the month of February, according to French Apple-focused website iGen [Google Translate] (via iDownloadBlog). The site's sources, which are often reliable, suggest that the event might take place during the last week of February, potentially on Tuesday, February 24.

The event may see Apple once again showcasing the Apple Watch, which is set to debut in April, and it may also see the launch of the 12-inch MacBook Air. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently predicted that the upcoming notebook will debut in March, which is in line with a late-February unveiling.

Rendering of the 12-inch MacBook Air by Martin Hajek
Apple's 12-inch MacBook Air is rumored to feature a new ultrathin design that does away with fans and introduces a revamped trackpad. It may include a low-power Core-M processor and it may be the first device to take advantage of the new reversible USB Type-C connector, which is much smaller and allows a USB cable to be inserted into a notebook in any orientation.

Apple may also use the event to unveil additional details on the Apple Watch, such as pricing and battery life. An event showing off the Apple Watch could explain why Apple has been asking some developers to have their apps ready to launch in the App Store in mid-February, as we reported last week. It's possible that Apple will use apps from these developers to demonstrate additional capabilities of the watch.

Though rumored, a February event is by no means confirmed at this point, and it is unclear what else Apple might cover in addition to the Apple Watch and the 12-inch MacBook Air.

Update 12:23 PM: Sources speaking to 9to5Mac have indicated Apple will not be holding a late February media event.

Christian Bale had already been cast in the title role, and this new addition... it's surprising, but kinda great.

Danny Boyle of Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later, and Trainspotting fame will direct the drama—which at one point was going to be a David Fincher affair—and it sounds like the whole film will offer a somewhat unconventional approach to the life of this tech icon.

Sorkin told Business Insider earlier this year: ""It's not a biopic."" Okay! So, that already sets it apart from the Ashton Kutcher joint. But also: ""It's not the story of Steve Jobs—it's something much different than that."" It's been rumored that the whole film will be three looong backstage scenes set right before big product launches, so maybe that means an epic walk-and-talk sequence that spans the full feature-length?

85,Report: Audio Reveals Pause Between Gunshots When Michael Brown Was Shot,"We're just two months away from the Apple Watch launch and things still seem not to be set in stone. Some new features or misfeatures about Apple's first wearable foray are still coming in. For this round, the source is supposedly none other than CEO Tim Cook himself. Speaking to a crowd of Apple employees at a flagship store in Berlin, Cook was said to have given some good news for worried would be Apple Watch owners: the smartwatch is resistant enough to use in the shower.

To be exact, what the executive supposedly said was that he uses it everywhere, even in the shower. We presume that it is a subtle confirmation that the Apple Watch will be more rugged that first thought. This would perhaps allay the worries of some over the device's ""water resistant"" only properties. Especially in a time where other smartwatches (read: Android Wear) are boasting IP67 ratings.

The one place that Tim Cook doesn't take his Apple Watch to is apparently his bed. And it's not for the lack of would be activity or sleep tracking apps. The CEO admits that he does charge it every night. That's not surprising considering Apple itself said that the Apple Watch would have enough battery to last you a day. That, however, might exclude the wearable from night activities, like sleep tracking. It might also not satisfy those who are wary of smartwatches exactly because they have to charge it every night.

Will the Apple Watch face tougher times, especially with the longer lasting, cross-platform, and now colorful Pebble Time, or even the rugged but classy LG Watch Urbane? Hardly, if we take sales of any Apple device as an indication. However, there is no denying the fact that Apple is treading new ground and it has to take care to tread carefully if the Apple Watch is to go beyond a one hit wonder.

86,Canadian official identifies dead Ottawa gunman as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau,"THE young soldier killed in a terror attack on the Canadian parliament last night was a devoted family man and a career soldier who planned on becoming a border guard.

By contrast, his killer was a convicted criminal who was on the terror watchlist and had his passport confiscated.

It was chance that brought the two men together, when Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, launched his attack as Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 25, stood guard at Ottawa’s war memorial, just metres away from the national parliament.

Zehaf-Bibeau shot Corporal Cirillo dead before running into parliament, only to be killed himself by the Sergeant-at-Arms, Kevin Vickers.

VICKERS: Sergeant-at-arms the hero of Ottawa

Mr Vickers has been hailed as a hero after he dashed into his office to retrieve a hand gun before shooting Zehaf-Bibeau dead.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper declared the act a “terror attack” as he said that Canadians would not be intimidated by such actions.

The attack had particular potency, with Canada already on alert because of a deadly hit-and-run earlier in the week against two Canadian soldiers by Muslim convert Martin Rouleau-Couture.

Corporal Cirillo’s aunt has described him as a “wonderful young man,” who joined the cadets in his hometown of Hamilton as an adolescent, and went on to enlist with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.

CANBERRA: Copycat fear locks down Parliament

In a cruel twist, he was carrying out a short rotation of just one month as a guard at the war memorial. The position was created seven years ago after a string of vandalism attempts.

The National War Memorial, which includes the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, honours Canadians who died for their country.

“He was a wonderful young man. Not an enemy in the world,” Cpl. Cirillo’s aunt, told the Globe and Mail newspaper

LIVE- Ottawa parliament attack

She said her nephew was devoted to his six-year-old son, and spent almost all of his spare time with his family, and working out, she said. “He was into being fit. And being a father and a son.”

Zehaf-Bibeau, on the other hand, had a criminal record in Quebec and British Columbia. The son of a Libyan mother and Quebecoise mother, he has convictions for drug possession and robbery.

He was recently designated a “high risk traveller” by the Canadian government, and his passport was seized.

OTTAWA: Ottawa attacker on terror watchlist

His mother Susan is the deputy chairman of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Radio Canada has reported.

Police said in the initial hours after the shootings that as many as two other gunmen may have taken part. But as the day wore on, the cordon around Parliament was eased, employees were allowed to go home, and the sense of urgency appeared to wane.

“Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said. He said it was a tragedy with “origins as yet not fully known, causes not yet fully understood.”

Witnesses said Corporal Cirillo was gunned down at point-blank range just before 10 am by a man carrying a rifle and dressed all in black, his face half-covered. They said the gunman appeared to raise his arms in triumph, then ran off and entered Parliament, a few hundred yards away, where dozens of shots soon rang out.

DEFENCE: ADF chief warns against complacency

People fled the complex by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, while others took cover inside and barricaded doors with chairs as police with rifles and body armour took up positions outside and cordoned off the normally bustling streets around Parliament.

Video footage posted online by the Globe and Mail newspaper showed police ducking for cover as they advanced along a stone hallway, loud gunfire echoing among parliament’s stone columns.

Reporters in Canada said that if the gunman had turned left as he ran into the building, he would have entered the room where a caucus meeting was being held.

Colonel Geordie Elms, a former commanding officer of the Argylls, told The Globe and Mail that his “heart just fell” when he saw the regiment’s distinctive gold leopard badge on the shot soldier on television broadcasts. “That could only be one unit,” he said he thought at the time.

Because the guard role is considered ceremonial, Mr Cirillo’s gun probably was not loaded, he said.

Hamilton Mayor Bob Bratina told the newspaper he had visited Corpl Cirillo’s family, who had told him that he was excited to be a part of the army.

“He was so proud of it,” he said, “and looked really great wearing the Argylls kit.”

87,Mystery woman behind the 'richest hands on the internet' revealed: Former pornstar 'makes $5m a year unwrapping Disney toys on YouTube',"The identity of the couple behind the mega-successful DC Toys Collector Youtube channel has finally been uncovered. Reportedly the highest paid creators on Youtube, having raked in an estimated $5 million in 2014, DC Toys Collector is allegedly 29-year-old, Brazilian-born Daiane DeJesus, a former adult film actress known as Sandy Summers, and her husband, Messias Credido, according to the Daily Mail. DeJesus’s porn star past could explain why the mega-successful Youtuber has chosen to stay anonymous despite months-long digging from numerous media outlets covering her channel’s surprising popularity. With over 5.2 billion views to date and nearly 3.8 million subscribers, the channel is an unbridled Youtube success — the scrutiny attracted by revelations of her adult film star past may have been figured by a cautious DeJesus to potentially dampen her kid-friendly channel’s image, and ultimately, perhaps, its huge revenue stream. Former neighbors and a “close friend” are behind the revelation that the DeJesus and Credido are behind the DC Toys Collector channel. The neighbors say they only learned of DeJesus’s adult film star career, which she reportedly quit seven years ago, after they saw her participating in a photoshoot by her swimming pool. They then say they were able to confirm their suspicions after identifying her in several “graphic adult-only videos.” The videos uploaded to the DC Toys Collector channel all feature a pair of disembodied, feminine hands unpackaging new toys as a soft voice narrates. They are a part of the “unboxing” video trend, which, according to Google, saw a 57% increase in views from 2013 to 2014. “That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere,” said one of the neighbors after listening to a DC Toys Collector video. The neighbor added: “Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange. “We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on. “Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers’ website and it all clicked into place.” When asked if the couple were behind the DC Toys Collector channel, formerly the Disney Collector channel, the ex-wife of Credido, Maribel Barreto, said: “Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can’t say any more.” Credido has also been identified as the creator behind the successful BluCollector Youtube channel, whose videos are nearly identical to the DC Toys Collector channel’s videos, except that they focus on toys aimed at young boys. According to the Daily Mail, DeJesus and husband reside in Orlando, Florida, in a house located in an “upscale” gated community. The couple have an 18-month-old son and were married in December of 2013, according to records seen by the tabloid. The DC Toys Collector channel began uploading videos in July of 2011 and is currently the 168th most-subscribed channel on Youtube. New videos are uploaded to the channel daily.",agree
88,"Apple 12-Inch MacBook Air Details Emerge; Device Could Be Thinner, Lighter Than Current Model","Our Retina MacBook Air rumour article brings together everything we know or can plausibly predict about Apple's next MacBook Air laptop: a laptop that we're pretty sure will come with a Retina display. We're also interested in rumours that Apple will be launching its next MacBook Air in a new size: one based on a 12in screen.

We report on (and analyse for credibility) all the rumours about every aspect of the new MacBook Air with Retina display: its release date, so you'll know exactly when the new Retina MacBook Air will launch; the Retina MacBook Air's specs, features and design; its UK pricing and availability; and all the rest of the clues and hints circulating on the web that could help us work out what to expect, and when to expect it. Finally, we will show you any Retina MacBook Air images that surface online, together with concept and mockup illustrations produced by clever artists with an eye for prediction.

We'll update this article whenever we hear of new information, clues and rumours about the next MacBook Air, so bookmark this page and check back here regularly for the latest information about the new MacBook Air with Retina display.

UPDATED: The plot thickens! Apple website 9to5Mac has commissioned an artist to produce detailed images of the next MacBook Air, based (the site says) on information from sources who have used prototypes. More info in the MacBook Air redesign section.

Retina MacBook Air release date rumours: When is the new MacBook Air coming out?
The latest 'word on the street' (not our words) sounds to us like a bit of a long shot, but here goes. It's been suggested by a number of websites that Apple will launch its next range of MacBooks during the Christmas holidays.

Aside from the obvious problem (which is that this would be an unbelievable nightmare for us poor souls in the media), this seems to be a case of a reasonable article by Boy Genius Report, written back in August, being rehashed and misinterpreted this month.

For a start, BGR wrote that the next MacBook Air would be ready in time for the Christmas holidays, not launched during them (releasing during the holidays would be a truly bizarre move, denying the products access to the lucrative pre-Christmas shopping period). That nuance seems to have been lost in translation. And beyond this, the article was as we said written in August, at which point a pre-Christmas launch still seemed possible. Now we're pretty much certain that the Retina MacBook Air will have to wait until 2015.

UPDATE, 7 Jan 2015: Sure enough, no MacBook Air appeared over Christmas. The very idea! The latest rumour suggests instead that a radically slimmed-down 12in MacBook Air will launch in mid-2015, perhaps making an appearance at WWDC 2015. See more details and images in the Design section, below.

We've been awaiting the launch of a new MacBook Air for some time. Back in summer 2014 Apple made a few tweaks to the MacBook Air line up, but this was mainly to reduce prices; the processor bump was very slight. Read our reviews of the current MacBook Air range here: 11in 2014 MacBook Air review and MacBook Air 2014, 13in, review.

What people are really waiting for is a new MacBook Air with Intel's (delayed) Broadwell processor, and a Retina display.

The new MacBook Air line up is said to include a completely new 12-inch model which may replace the 11-inch version, giving customers the option of a slighly bigger screen, or it may replace the 13-inch model, where customers could instead opt for the comparitively priced 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display.

So when will this new MacBook Air arrive? Reports in mid June suggested that Apple would begin production of this 12-inch MacBook Air in the third quarter. According to a DigiTimes report, Quanta Computer was set to begin production of the new 12-inch MacBook Air in July. This may have started, if the new Intel chips arrived in time...

They may have: Intel has issued a press release regarding the arrival of its new Core M chip that some believe could be used in the new MacBook Air. A number of manufacturers are already said to be using this new chip in their laptops and tablets, and some of these models will be available in October. According to Intel, Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Toshiba are all using the Core M.

If this new Intel chip is used by Apple, reports suggest that the new Retina MacBook Air will be available in time for Christmas.

In an August report on Digitimes, the Taiwan-based site claimed that its sources in the Taiwanese supply chain said that the production of components for the new MacBook had begun and that it may launch before the end of this year, or next year.

However, there are also reports that suggest the new Retina MacBook Air could be delayed until next year - it may not be using these Core M chips, relying instead on a different series of Intel Core i5 Broadwell processors (more on that below).

One report even suggests a mid-2015 launch date, claiming that the date has already been pushed back on multiple occasions.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours : Redesign, new colours, thinner design
On 6 January 2015, 9to5Mac posted a series of images that it says show the next MacBook Air's radical new design.

New 12in MacBook Air design mockups by 9to5mac

Bear in mind that these are artist's renders rather than photos of the real thing (although we're sure you'll agree that they're extremely well done - the artist is Michael Steeber). 9to5mac commissioned the images based on information it acquired from sources within Apple ""who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer"".

It isn't entirely clear how much of the design comes from the sources and how much from the artist's imagination, although many of the most major changes (to the keyboard layout, for instance) are obviously in the former category.

Sure enough, the new design is for a laptop with a new screen size: 12 inches. Yet the slimming process in these designs is so extreme that the new 12in MacBook Air actually has a smaller body than the existing 11in MacBook Air. The screen is a little bigger, but everything around the screen has been shrunk.

Here (according to the renders, at any rate) is how the new 12in MacBook Air (left) will compare to the current 11in MacBook Air (right):

New 12in MacBook Air design mockups by 9to5mac

This also partly illustrates the biggest bombshell in these leaks: the new design finds space for only one port on each side of the laptop. It has a USB port on the righthand edge (the new, smaller and reversible, Type-C USB) and a headphone socket, along with a couple of microphone holes, on the left. If this is right, the MacBook will have to be powered via the USB port - and sure enough, USB Type-C will be perfectly adequate for that purpose. It just means that you won't be able to use a USB hard drive, wired mouse (or wireless mouse dongle) or other USB accessory while the MacBook is plugged in.

Macworld contributor Kirk McElhearn is one of the sceptics who have pointed out the numerous inconveniences this would impose, and it's possible - likely, we would say - that the eventual layout will be less extreme. We think the MagSafe power connection is likely to survive. 

As we mentioned briefly, the keyboard is also designed differently. The power button now sits next to the Esc key at the top-left corner of the keyboard, and the keys have in general been shrunk down and squeezed together. The trackpad, on the other hand, has been expanded and now comes closer to the keys.

Of course, 9to5mac's images aren't the first apparent leak about the next MacBook Air's design.

Jack Marsh, a 16-year-old blogger who appears to have a source with plausible information about the new MacBook Air, seems to have become the the go-to blogger for all MacBook Air rumours. There have certainly been other young bloggers who have gained insight into unannounced Apple products, but as yet we can't be sure the claims are legitimate.

Marsh has a rumour about the MacBook Air to add to an earlier rumour that suggested the new model would come in gold, silver and space grey finishes (more on that below). Now he claims his source has told him that the new design is so thin Apple has had to switch to a new reversible USB Type C connector which is significantly smaller than USB 3 (it's 8.4x2.6mm).

Apparently the MagSafe port is also getting a redesign for the same reason: the laptop chassis is too thin to accomodate the current MagSafe charger. Indeed the MacBook Air may charge in an entirely new way, although Marsh's source wasn't clear on whether this had been finalised yet.

The MacBook Air is also said to feature thin bezels with a keyboard that stretches to the edge of the laptop. Marsh also claims his source told him: ""The display bezels are noticeably thinner - quite similar to the current MacBook Pro Retina lineup.""

Marsh's earlier report claimed that the new MacBook Air will come in iPhone-like space grey and gold finishes, as well as the usual aluminium.

MacRumors lent some credibility to this inisial report, claiming that they are aware that ""Apple has at least considered launching the 12in notebook with several different 'special edition' colour options"". And it wouldn't be the first time Apple has introduced a range of colour choices on their Mac laptops.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: 12-inch screen
Many of the new MacBook Air rumours suggest this model will feature a 12in screen.

Some sources point to evidence that Apple is working with 12in screens, but there have been claims that Quanta Computer will be building a rumoured 12-inch iPad later this year and it could be the iPad Pro that is being referred to here.

According to a DigiTimes report in June, sources claim Apple wishes to introduce a smaller MacBook Air to make clearer the distinction between the 11-inch MacBook Air and the iPad Air with its 9.7-inch screen.

Canalys analyst Daniel Matte also believes Apple is working on a new version of the MacBook Air - one with a 11.88in screen. Other rumours place the screen size at 12in (which probably matches Matte's expectations).

In his blog Matte seems to be suggesting that there may only be one MacBook Air - this new 12-inch model, with the 13-inch model being phased out in favour of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display.

KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested back in October 2013 that Apple will launch a 12-inch MacBook Air in 2014. Kuo suggested that this new MacBook Air would have an entirely new design.

The smaller 12in model could still accommodate a reasonably sized screen and keyboard if it had a smaller bezel.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Fanless design
The new MacBook Air is also said to be even thinner than the existing MacBook Air. This is based on the theory that it will use Intel's new Intel Core M processor, a chip that doesn't need fans. By using this processor it is claimed that Apple could make the laptop 9mm thin. The MacBook Air is currently 0.3-1.7cm thick so it could be almost 1cm thinner at its thickest point.

Apparently the fan assembly is the reason why the MacBook Air is thicker at one end than the other. Removing the fan assembly would enable Apple to make the laptop thinner than ever, according to reports.

Presumably there will be some sort of cooling system built in, but that may not be necessary. The new Intel processors are said to be efficient enough to make the removal of the fan feasible - indeed there are already laptops on the market that do not feature a fan.

Even the Core M may still require cooling in a 12in laptop, though. The new Broadwell processor should enable a fanless design for the smaller (up to 11.6in) laptop or mobile device, notes Motley Fool, based on what Intel said at its developer forum in 2013.

It has been suggested that the MacBook Air could also offer thermal scaling and thermal management.

Another advantage of a fanless design would be quiet operation. There would also be no moving parts (making it less likely to break), and it could also offer higher battery capacity because the remaining space could be used to house a bigger battery.

(We can't help but worry that history could repeat itself if the MacBook Air is fan free - Steve Jobs famously refused to include a fan in the Apple III, leading to hardware failure.)

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: USB Type C
If Marsh's source (above) is correct the new MacBook Air may offer USB Type C support, which is smaller than USB 3 (it's 8.4x2.6mm). USB Type C is able to support 10Gbps data transfers, which is twice as fast as USB 3, but still slower than Thunderbolt 2 (although the same as the older Thunderbolt 1).

It will also support for up to 100 watts of power, which is apparently enough to power 4K displays, as Apple's Thunderbolt cable does currently. The only problem is that USB Type C isn't backwards-compatible.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Inductive charging
Marsh's source also claims that the MagSafe port may get a redesign and that the MacBook Air may charge in an entirely new way. Perhaps the new MacBook Air will use inductive charging like the Apple Watch does.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Trackpad changes
According to a report on Chinese site Weiphone earlier this year, the new MacBook Air will be thinner and lighter, a feat it will achieve by removing the fan and the clicking mechanism in the trackpad.

The new 12in model will drop the trackpad and introduce ""force and optical sensors"" and new touch gestures, according to this report from BEN Latest News.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Retina display
Will the next MacBook Air feature a Retina display? That's one of the strongest and most persistent rumours, and it's certainly possible.

Apple may opt to keep prices down (and battery life up) by keeping the screen non-Retina; but we don't think so. According to our own reviews of the MacBook Air, the MacBook Air is currently let down by its display, which has a lower resolution than the competition.

Canalys analyst Daniel Matte has written a blog claiming that Apple will add a Retina display to the MacBook Air this year. He expects that we will see a 11.88-inch model with a resolution of 2,732x1,536 pixels, the same 264ppi that the iPad Air offers.

He explains the significance of Apple using the same display technology for the MacBook Air and iPad Air, stating: ""It turns out that an ~11.88"" Retina MacBook Air with a 2732 x 1536 resolution happens to have the exact same pixel density as the 9.7"" 2048 x 1536 Retina iPads: ~264 PPI. It would make sense for Apple to take advantage of the same display technology it has been utilizing for the 9.7"" iPads by cutting their panels to this larger size.""

Rumours also claim that the new MacBook Air Retina display could have a resolution of 2,304 x 1,440 for a rumoured 12in display (discussed below). That's 226 pixels per inch, compared to 227 pixels per inch for the 13in MacBook Pro (which offers 2,560-by-1,600 resolution). This adds up to a 16:10 aspect ratio like that found on the 13in MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models, rather than the 16:9 aspect ratio currently offered by the 11in MacBook Air.

The current 11.6-inch MacBook Air offers a 1366 x 768 pixel display.

The rumours of a MacBook Air with Retina display have been long running. Back in February 2013, rumours suggested that Apple was planning to launch a revamped MacBook Air with a Retina display in the third-quarter of 2013. A separate report in March 2013 also claimed that Apple would introduce a Retina display to the MacBook Air in 2013. Since this didn't happen in 2013, it is perhaps likely for 2014. 

Apple does appear to be moving the whole of its range to Retina display. The company updated the Retina versions of its MacBook Pro in 2013, and also introduced a Retina iPad mini in October 2013.

The reason for the supposition is that Apple was recruiting for a engineers with experience in LED backlighting and LCD displays, in February, according to CultofMac. In an LCD display the bunches of pixels with wires running behind to connect them. The backlight has to shine though this mesh of wires to light up the pixels. In an IGZO display more light is able to shine though this mesh of wires, so the power requirements are lower, and battery life can be preserved. As a result we could see even longer battery life than the 12 hours currently on offer from the 13in MacBook Air.

Rumours about a Retina MacBook Air with a smaller display have been circulating for some time. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested back in October 2013 that Apple will launch a 12-inch MacBook Air in 2014. Kuo suggested that this new MacBook Air would have an entirely new design.

Then back in January 2014, Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang predicted that a 12in MacBook/iPad hybrid would launch in the autumn of 2014. It is possible that the rumoured Retina display MacBook Air could be this Mac.

Canalys analyst Daniel Matte also believes Apple will add a Retina display to the MacBook Air this year.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Processor
Intel has announced the new Intel Core M chip. Some expect that this processor may be used by Apple inside the new MacBook Air. As mentioned above, because this chip doesn't need fans, the new MacBook Air could be less than a centimeter thick at its thickest point. Since it uses the 14nm processor, the processor itself it is tiny.

The Core M processor should also enable the new MacBook to be more power-efficient with better battery life. Intel claims it's the most energy-efficient chip yet.

The Core M also offers excellent graphics processing power, according to Intel. Intel says it will offer seven times the graphics power of four-year-old machines, and double the graphical and three times the web performance of the current range of high-end tablets.

However, Intel has not confirmed that Apple will use the new processor. (In the press release regarding the new chip, Intel mentions Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Toshiba as potentially using the Core M. Some of these models will be available in October, according to Intel.)

The Core M is designed for small laptops, large tablets and 2-in-1 devices, and Intel is positioning the chips as being for use in laptops of 13.3in, tablets above 10in and dual devices. Apple would traditionally use the Core i5 chips in its MacBook, so it is possible that these processors will never appear in a MacBook Air which may instead use the new U Broadwell processor, which may not ship until 2015.

Redmond Pie reports that performance with the Core M hasn't been particularly impressive; it was featured in the Lenovo Yogo 3 Pro, which didn't exactly set the world alight: benchmark speed tests and overall reviews rated the device quite poorly. It's therefore been suggested that Apple may give the Core M a miss and go instead for an i5 or i7 chip.

(On the other hand, some analysts have argued that Lenovo's implementation of the Core M, rather than the innate qualities of the Core M itself, was to blame for the sub-standard performance, and that Apple's engineers would be able to coax solid performance from a Core M-equipped MacBook Air. We shall see.)

Whichever Broadwell processor Apple does use, it should make the Retina display MacBook Air possible. Broadwell is said to consume 30 percent less power than its predecessor Haswell, and that should be good news for battery life on the portable Macs, especially those with power hungry screens.

Other features of the Broadwell chip are that it is low power and offers integration with WiDi, 4G WWAN and WiGig networks.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: May not use Intel chips
This rumour has been floating around for some time. It is possible that Apple will ditch the Intel processor in its range of laptop in favour of its own home-made A-series chips, like those found in the iPad and iPhone.  

Some have even speculated that the new MacBook Air could mark some sort of crossover between the iPad and the MacBook, perhaps an iPad Pro.

However, rumours that Apple will move from Intel to ARM chips seem unlikely, based on this explaination from Cult of Mac.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: UK price
With the price of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with Retina display being so close we had expected that Apple would reduce the price of the entry-level MacBook even further. It's currently £749 for the 11in model, which is £100 less than in 2013. This compares to the MacBook Pro Retina starting price of £999. However, the fact that the top-of the range iPhone 6 Plus costs more than the entry level MacBook Air (£789) makes us think that the MacBook Air price is more likely to increase.

It may be that the 13-inch MacBook Air is discontinued, as that model is similar in price to the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina, but not equal in specs. This would leave the cheaper 12-inch MacBook Air models with, potentially, an entry-level price of £800.

When it first launched in October 2012, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display started at £1,449. This was reduced to £1,249 a few months later when the range received a processor upgrade. Now, with the April 2014 update to the MacBook Air, the entry-level price of the 13-inch model is a much more compelling £999 which makes the difference between the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display and the 13-inch MacBook Air £250 rather than £150.

In his predictions last year, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the price of this new 12-inch MacBook Air model could be lower than the current line up of Mac laptops.

Didn't Apple already introduce the 2014 MacBook Air?
Apple unveiled the latest update to the MacBook Air on 29 April 2014.  Quietly updating its MacBook Air line-up with improved Haswell processors from Intel. You can read our review of the 2014 11in MacBook Air and the review of the 13in MacBook Air here.

Aside from the small processor boost and a tiny battery life tweak, the main change for the new MacBook Air models was the price. Each model is now under £1,000, with prices starting at £749, £100 less than the previous models. This helps keep the MacBook Air an attractive option for customers, as the previous price was not much different to the price of the new MacBook Pro with Retina display.

The range update came as some surprise as the Retina display for the MacBook Air rumour was already in circulation. Prior to the MacBook Air update in April, there were suggestions that the new MacBook Air with Retina display could launch at WWDC, but this was obviously not the case.

Why is the Retina MacBook Air delayed?
If there is a delay, the key reason may be the availability of Intel processors, rather than the production of the new design.

Intel's newest generation of chips - the successor to the Haswell chips currently in the MacBook Air - called Broadwell has been plagued by delays. However, in a conference call about Intel's second-quarter results on 15 July, Intel's chief executive Brian Krzanich confirmed Intel’s hardware partners will have Broadwell systems on store shelves in the run up to Christmas. He said: ""We said we would have products on shelves for the holiday season and we continue to work with our partners and we’re on schedule to have product on shelf in the holiday.""

As we mention above, some of these new chips are now shipping, however, anyone awaiting the new Retina MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac and Mac mini should note that there are various Broadwell chips being developed by Intel, and the chips that Intel confirmed are shipping now are the M variety, destined for fanless two-in-ones. The new MacBook Air may use the U Broadwell processor, which may not ship until 2015.

We are sure that Apple is pretty frustrated with Intel.

Shipment of Skylake – the successor to Broadwell which will offer even more power than that chip - is also delayed.

New Retina MacBook Air release date: Will the MacBook Air be an iPad Pro?
There are also rumours that Apple could launch a 12in iPad, but this might not arrive until 2015, or the rumours could relate to the 12in MacBook.

There are also rumours that the new MacBook Air merge with the iPad to create the iPad Pro. You can read more about the iPad Pro rumours here.

We think that a MacBook Air that offered a dual boot system for iOS 7 and Mac OS X would be very interesting, however, Tim Cook last year ruled out any kind of convergence suggesting that a Toaster Refrigerator wouldn't work.

Will the old non-Retina MacBook Air remain?
If Apple launches a 12in MacBook Air, will it discontinue the existing models? It's possible that if Apple launches a 12in Retina MacBook Air model it will discontinue both, or either of the existing models. Equally, Apple could maintain one of the existing models as an entry-level model. It seems more likely that it would keep the 11in model on at an even lower price, rather than keep on the bigger 13in model.

One reason why Apple may keep a lower-priced MacBook Air on is the fact that Apple has just introduced a new entry-level iMac and already the MacBook Air looks superior to that, despite costing less. If Apple wants a low end option, it would appear unlekely that the Retina MacBook Air would be it.

The new MacBook Air will be solar-powered
Ok, so this is a bit of an out-there rumour, but it really is possible that Apple will one day release a new MacBook Air with a solar powered display.

In January 2013, Apple was granted a patent that described a method for harnessing sunlight to illuminate a MacBook's display. This patent is actually the seventh solar-related patent Apple has gained in the past two years.

89,Jihadi John identity revealed as Mohammed Emwazi: live,"Adding to Apple's iOS 8 launch troubles, a report on Monday claims the operating system's ""Reset All Settings"" feature for hardware wiping user preferences also deletes data stored in iCloud Drive.

As discovered by MacRumors, the issue presents itself when iPhone and iPad users attempt to reset preferences via the device's Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings option. The feature allows users to troubleshoot possible iOS issues by reverting all system settings back to factory baselines.

As OS X 10.10 Yosemite, and subsequently iCloud Drive, is not yet available for consumer download aside from Apple's public beta testing program, the effects on consumers are non-existent. However, with a large number of untrained public beta participants opting in to the service with iOS 8, the problem could become serious.

According to the report, one iPad user performed the reset and found his local iWork documents deleted, which consequently wiped those same documents from the cloud when the tablet synced to iCloud. It appears only data from first-party apps connected to iCloud Drive are affected by the bug, though not all users are seeing the issue play out as described.

In some cases, files are being delete upon syncing with iCloud, while other data remains untouched. It is suggested that users back up iCloud Drive documents to a local computer prior to performing the Reset All Settings operation.

iCloud Drive is Apple's solution to cloud storage, syncing and collaboration. The system allows seamless file transport and storage across iOS, OS X and Windows, while enabling advanced features like document editing, asset tagging and drag-and-drop data management.

Apple will activate iCloud Drive alongside the release of OS X Yosemite later this fall, bringing the company's The feature has already rolled out to beta testers, as well as the iCloud.com beta website, which now supports access and editing of stored documents.",unrelated

91,Wife and son of Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 'detained at Lebanon border',"DC Toy Collector is the “highest paid performer” on YouTube making nearly $5 million last year unboxing Disney toys. However, little has been known about the woman-behind-the-hands of the popular YouTube channel. In fact, her face is never shown in the video, only her voice, toys and hands. However, a recent report reveals the true identity of the YouTube hit and the identity is somewhat shocking. A former Brazilian porn star is behind the wholesome Disney videos and it is noted that during the early years of “Disney Collector,” the woman was filming both Disney unboxing videos and porn in the same Florida home.

The Daily Mail reports that Brazilian Daiane DeJeus, also known as Sandy Summers in the porn industry, is the woman behind the hit Disney Collector Youtube videos. Reporters tracked down information on DeJeus that aligns with public records information regarding the widely popular DC Toy Collector YouTube channel. After tracking down DeJeus, the reporters spoke with family and friends who confirmed that Daiane was behind the million dollar videos.

DeJeus has went to unfathomable measures to ensure her identity remained secret and for good reason. The target market of the YouTube channel, which caters to Disney lovers such as children and families, may not remain viewers if they knew the owner’s secret. DeJeus was not only a Disney fanatic, but also a porn star. Going by the name Sandy Summers, Dejeus filmed numerous x-rated videos for the adult film industry in the same home that she filmed some of her early DC Toy Collector features.

Family and friends have identified DeJeus as the mystery unboxer and note that certain physical features on the woman’s hands and arms can be seen in many of the YouTube videos.

“They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.”

Aside from the physical similarities, former neighbors say DeJeus has an unmistakable voice and say that many people on the street knew what she was up to.

‘That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere. Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.”

Would you have ever imagined that the popular DC Toy Collector videos were being filmed in the same house as adult films by a porn star?

Jesus Murillo Karam said further tests were being carried out on four other recently discovered grave sites.

The 43 students went missing three weeks ago amid violent protests in Iguala, south of Mexico City.

Mr Karam said 14 more police officers had been arrested, accused of handing the students over to a drugs gang.

About 50 people have been arrested in connection with the students' disappearance, with the vast majority being local police officers.

The officers are believed to have been working for a drugs gang, known as the Guerreros Unidos.

On Tuesday, police said the gang's leader, Benjamin Mondragon, had killed himself when he was about to be arrested during an operation by Mexican security forces in the state of Morelos.

The missing students all attended a teacher training college in Iguala, some 200km (125 miles) south of Mexico City.

The college has a history of left-wing activism but it is not clear whether the students were targeted for their political beliefs.

Renewed hope

They disappeared after deadly clashes with the police on 26 September in which six people died. Eyewitnesses reported seeing them being bundled into police vans.

Will Grant, the BBC's Mexico correspondent, says confirmation the missing students were not found in mass graves will give their families renewed hope.

(RNS) When Pope Francis recently sought to comfort a distraught boy whose dog had died, the pontiff took the sort of pastoral approach he is famous for — telling the youngster not to worry, that he would one day see his pet in heaven.

“Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures,” Francis said reassuringly.

 This image is available for Web and print publication. For questions, contact Sally Morrow.

It was a sparkling moment on a rainy November day, and the setting in St. Peter’s Square only burnished Francis’ reputation as a kindly “people’s pope.” The story naturally lit up social media, became instant promotional material for vegetarians and animal rights groups, and on Friday even made it to the front page of The New York Times.

There’s only one problem: apparently none of it ever happened.

Yes, a version of that quotation was uttered by a pope, but it was said decades ago by Paul VI, who died in 1978. There is no evidence that Francis repeated the words during his public audience on Nov. 26, as has been widely reported, nor was there was a boy mourning his dead dog.

So how could such a fable so quickly become taken as fact?

Part of the answer may be the topic of the pope’s talk to the crowd that day, which centered on the End Times and the transformation of all creation into a “new heaven” and a “new earth.” Citing St. Paul in the New Testament, Francis said that is not “the annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us, but the bringing of all things into the fullness of being.”

The trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an Italian news report that extended Francis’ discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to heaven.

“One day we will see our pets in the eternity of Christ,” the report quoted Paul VI as telling a disconsolate boy years ago.

The story was titled, somewhat misleadingly: “Paradise for animals? The Pope doesn’t rule it out.” It wasn’t clear which pope the writer meant, however.

The next day, Nov. 27, a story in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera by veteran Vaticanista Gian Guido Vecchi pushed the headline further: “The Pope and pets: “Paradise is open to all creatures.”

Vecchi faithfully recounted the pope’s talk about a new creation, and also cited Paul VI’s remark.

But the headline put those words in Francis’ mouth, and that became the story.

The Italian version of the Huffington Post picked it up next and ran an article quoting Francis as saying “We will go to heaven with the animals” and contending that the pope was quoting St. Paul – not Pope Paul – as making that statement to console a boy who lost his dog. (That story, by the way, is nowhere in the Bible.)

The urban legend became unstoppable a week later when it was translated into English and picked up by the British press, which cited St. Paul as saying that “One day we will see our animals again in (the) eternity of Christ,” while it has Francis adding the phrase: “Paradise is open to all God’s creatures.”

Fueling the meme was the fact that Francis was photographed accepting a gift of two donkeys from a company promoting the use of donkey milk for infants allergic to cow’s milk – and Francis said his own mother gave him donkey’s milk as a baby.

Social media and other media outlets then picked up the story, further conflating the statements and the chronology. It became a hot mess of a story that was also sparking another theological debate by a pope who was known for prompting controversy.

The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets, paradise, and Pope Francis.

The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets, paradise, and Pope Francis.
When The New York Times went with the story, along with input from ethicists and theologians, it became gospel truth.

Television programs discussed the pope’s theological breakthrough, news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals, and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the afterlife. At America magazine, the Rev. James Martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of Francis’ statements and what level of authority they may have. It was all very interesting and illuminating, but based on a misunderstanding.

A number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train wreck:

The story had so much going for it: Francis took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and sisters.
Pope Francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment, and almost since the day he was elected in 2013 he has stressed the Christian duty to care for creation.
Francis also blessed a blind man’s guide dog shortly after he was elected, an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for animals.
Moreover, the media and the public are so primed for Francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out; it fit with the pattern.
In most accounts, Francis’ comments were also set against statements by his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who insisted that animals did not have souls. That apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative Benedict against the ostensibly liberal Francis.

That may be true in some areas, but probably not when it comes to animals.

Adding insult to injury, the Times article cited St. John Paul II as saying in 1990 that animals have souls and are “as near to God as men are.” But that, too, was a misquote, as media critic Dawn Eden explained at the website GetReligion.

On the other hand, there should have been warnings signs: Francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people, and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go hungry.

In addition, the pope’s huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of myth-making: news reports last year said that Francis was sneaking out of the Vatican at night to feed the homeless around Rome.

The pope personally debunked that rumor in an interview last March, saying the idea “has never crossed my mind” and that “depicting the pope to be a sort of superman, a type of star, seems offensive to me.”

Maybe he’ll have to give another interview to deflate this latest story, and to offer his real thoughts on pets and paradise.

100,Magic mushrooms found in BUCKINGHAM PALACE by Alan Titchmarsh,"LONDON — The man in the black balaclava who has seemed to have beheaded several foreign hostages in Islamic State videos has been identified by British security services as Mohammed Emwazi, a British national from London.

Known in the news media as “Jihadi John,” he is said to have been born in Kuwait and traveled to Syria in 2012. His name was first published on Thursday on the website of The Washington Post.

The story was confirmed by a senior British security official, who said that the British government had identified Mr. Emwazi some time ago but had not disclosed his name for operational reasons.

Mr. Emwazi, 27, grew up in Queen’s Park, West London, and graduated from the University of Westminster with a degree in computer programming.

102,Canadian Soldier Shot At Ottawa War Memorial: Report,"A disturbing video posted online appears to show the beheading of American journalist James Foley, who was kidnapped while covering the Syrian conflict in 2012.

In the video a man who appears to be Foley, dressed in orange, kneels beside an armed man clad in black. Foley delivers a statement condemning U.S. action in Iraq and says that the U.S. government is his “real killers.”

“For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” Foley says in halting speech. “I wish I had more time. I wish I could have the hope of freedom of seeing my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.”

Seconds later, the figure dressed in black brandishes a knife and identifies himself as with the Islamic State, the name the brutal terror group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria took on after its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared himself the leader of all Muslims.

“Today your military air force has attacked us daily… Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims,” the figure in black says. He then addresses President Obama directly, saying “any attempt… to deny the Muslims their right to live in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.”

Foley is then killed. The video continues, showing American Steven Sotloff, who has written for national publications like Time, also dressed in orange and on his knees.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the figure in black says.

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the U.S. intelligence community ""is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity.""

""If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,"" spokesperson Caitlin Hayden wrote in a statement to reporters.

The U.S. government offers a $10 million reward for information leading to ISIS leader al-Baghdadi’s capture.

Foley was on assignment in Syria for the news outlet GlobalPost. The news organization's co-founder Charles Sennott said today there is ""no reliable proof that this execution is authentic"" and that they're working to gather information.

""If the video is verified, it is just unfathomable darkness to think that a life as bright as Jim Foley's ended that way,"" Sennott said. ""He was an experienced and fearless journalist who believed deeply in reporting from the frontlines.""

In an interview with The Boston Globe in 2011, Foley spoke about being held captive while covering the uprising in Libya and the importance of his job.

“I believe that frontline journalism is important,” Foley said. “Without these photos and videos and firsthand experience, we really can’t tell the world how bad it might be.”

Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., had worked with Foley's family and the State Department in their efforts to get Foley back.

103,Audio recording allegedly captures moment Michael Brown was shot,"14.3K 3077reddit70  32

(RNS) When Pope Francis recently sought to comfort a distraught boy whose dog had died, the pontiff took the sort of pastoral approach he is famous for — telling the youngster not to worry, that he would one day see his pet in heaven.

“Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures,” Francis said reassuringly.

 This image is available for Web and print publication. For questions, contact Sally Morrow.

It was a sparkling moment on a rainy November day, and the setting in St. Peter’s Square only burnished Francis’ reputation as a kindly “people’s pope.” The story naturally lit up social media, became instant promotional material for vegetarians and animal rights groups, and on Friday even made it to the front page of The New York Times.

There’s only one problem: apparently none of it ever happened.

Yes, a version of that quotation was uttered by a pope, but it was said decades ago by Paul VI, who died in 1978. There is no evidence that Francis repeated the words during his public audience on Nov. 26, as has been widely reported, nor was there was a boy mourning his dead dog.

So how could such a fable so quickly become taken as fact?

Part of the answer may be the topic of the pope’s talk to the crowd that day, which centered on the End Times and the transformation of all creation into a “new heaven” and a “new earth.” Citing St. Paul in the New Testament, Francis said that is not “the annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us, but the bringing of all things into the fullness of being.”

The trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an Italian news report that extended Francis’ discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to heaven.

“One day we will see our pets in the eternity of Christ,” the report quoted Paul VI as telling a disconsolate boy years ago.

The story was titled, somewhat misleadingly: “Paradise for animals? The Pope doesn’t rule it out.” It wasn’t clear which pope the writer meant, however.

The next day, Nov. 27, a story in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera by veteran Vaticanista Gian Guido Vecchi pushed the headline further: “The Pope and pets: “Paradise is open to all creatures.”

Vecchi faithfully recounted the pope’s talk about a new creation, and also cited Paul VI’s remark.

But the headline put those words in Francis’ mouth, and that became the story.

The Italian version of the Huffington Post picked it up next and ran an article quoting Francis as saying “We will go to heaven with the animals” and contending that the pope was quoting St. Paul – not Pope Paul – as making that statement to console a boy who lost his dog. (That story, by the way, is nowhere in the Bible.)

The urban legend became unstoppable a week later when it was translated into English and picked up by the British press, which cited St. Paul as saying that “One day we will see our animals again in (the) eternity of Christ,” while it has Francis adding the phrase: “Paradise is open to all God’s creatures.”

Fueling the meme was the fact that Francis was photographed accepting a gift of two donkeys from a company promoting the use of donkey milk for infants allergic to cow’s milk – and Francis said his own mother gave him donkey’s milk as a baby.

Social media and other media outlets then picked up the story, further conflating the statements and the chronology. It became a hot mess of a story that was also sparking another theological debate by a pope who was known for prompting controversy.

The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets, paradise, and Pope Francis.

The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets, paradise, and Pope Francis.
When The New York Times went with the story, along with input from ethicists and theologians, it became gospel truth.

Television programs discussed the pope’s theological breakthrough, news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals, and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the afterlife. At America magazine, the Rev. James Martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of Francis’ statements and what level of authority they may have. It was all very interesting and illuminating, but based on a misunderstanding.

A number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train wreck:

The story had so much going for it: Francis took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and sisters.
Pope Francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment, and almost since the day he was elected in 2013 he has stressed the Christian duty to care for creation.
Francis also blessed a blind man’s guide dog shortly after he was elected, an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for animals.
Moreover, the media and the public are so primed for Francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out; it fit with the pattern.
In most accounts, Francis’ comments were also set against statements by his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who insisted that animals did not have souls. That apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative Benedict against the ostensibly liberal Francis.

That may be true in some areas, but probably not when it comes to animals.

Adding insult to injury, the Times article cited St. John Paul II as saying in 1990 that animals have souls and are “as near to God as men are.” But that, too, was a misquote, as media critic Dawn Eden explained at the website GetReligion.

On the other hand, there should have been warnings signs: Francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people, and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go hungry.

In addition, the pope’s huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of myth-making: news reports last year said that Francis was sneaking out of the Vatican at night to feed the homeless around Rome.

The pope personally debunked that rumor in an interview last March, saying the idea “has never crossed my mind” and that “depicting the pope to be a sort of superman, a type of star, seems offensive to me.”

Maybe he’ll have to give another interview to deflate this latest story, and to offer his real thoughts on pets and paradise.

The NYPD and Mayor de Blasio are prepared to initiate a change in policy that would drastically reduce the number of arrests for possession of pot, according to law-enforcement sources.

The department had already been halting its pot “buy and bust” operations, a crime-fighting staple that often led to gun seizures and arrests for outstanding warrants, The Post had earlier reported.

Sources said that the “powers that be,” including City Hall, wanted to see a decrease in arrests for pot because they have “disastrous consequences’’ on police relations with minorities.

Blacks and Hispanics have accounted for 86 percent of low-level pot busts this year, according to the Marijuana Research Project.

At a press conference scheduled for Monday, de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton are expected to announce the key aspects of the policy change.

They will also likely spell out such details as how much marijuana will be considered low-level.

De Blasio plans to meet with the city’s five district attorneys this week, according to The New York Times, and Brooklyn DA Kenneth Thompson has already expressed disapproval at policy change.

Libyan terrorists have posted pictures of themselves online posing with some of the aeroplanes taken from Tripoli airport after fighters seized it last month.

Soldiers from the group Libyan Dawn can be seen climbing on to the wings of commercial jets while smiling and waving for the camera.

U.S. officials fear that these aeroplanes could now be used to carry out 9/11-style attacks in the region on the anniversary of the tragedy this month.

A total of 11 commercial jets from state-owned carriers Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways went missing in August after militants from the so-called 'masked men brigade' overran the airport.

In pictures posted online Jihadi soldiers can be seen clambering over aircraft at Tripoli airport. At least 11 planes went missing after the airport fell at the end of last month

Tripoli airport was left as little more than a smouldering ruin after rebels seized control of it in August

Officials have been warning for some time about the deteriorating situation in Libya, which was controlled by dictator Muammar Gaddaffi until he was killed in October 2011.

'There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,' one official told the Washington Free-Beacon. 'We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.'

September 11 not only marks the anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center but it will also be the second anniversary of the raid of the U.S. Ambassador's compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Four Americans were killed in the attack, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

Ansar al-Shariah, the group Washington holds responsible for the attack, have also seized parts of the Libyan capital and are known to work with terrorists from ISIS.

However they are not thought to be working with fighters from Libyan Dawn, as they are an Al-Qaeda affiliated group.

Libyan Dawn, an Al-Qaeda affiliated group, are now in control of part of Tripoli, as are Ansar al-Shariah, the group held responsible for the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Libya

Tripoli International Airport was being run by two anti-Islamist militias and had been closed since mid-July when it was taken over at the end of August by the group Libyan Dawn.

Pictures show the aftermath of the firefight, with planes completely or partially blasted and several littered with bullet holes.

Tripoli is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gaddaffi left power. The militias, many of which originate from rebel forces that fought Gaddaffi, became powerful players in post-war Libya, filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army.

Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order, but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped-for transition to democracy.

On Sunday, the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital.

Ansar al-Sharia has ties to the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), the Syrian group which today released the filmed beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff - the second recorded execution of a U.S. hostage by the group.

Fears: Nearly a dozen commercial planes are missing in Libya after a radical Islamic group overtook the international airport in the capital of Tripoli late last month.

Aftermath: Tripoli International Airport was overtaken by the group Libyan Dawn last month and now 11 aircraft for Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways are missing

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui told Al Jazeera television after the airport attack that the planes had been taken by another Islamic group, the Masked Men Brigade.

Mekkaoui said there is 'credible intelligence' that the Masked Men Brigade 'is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the Maghreb state' on the 9/11 anniversary.

Sebastian Gorka, a counterterrorism expert, told the Free-Beacon that the planes could be used in two ways to strike North Africa or even as far as the oil fields of Saudi Arabia.

'The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,' Gorka, the Maj Gen Charles Horner chair at the Marine Corps University, said.

'The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,' he added.

U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the eleven planes' disappearance, but are reportedly working to track them down.

A 'feminist' blog from the US has caused outrage after its author apparently admitted aborting her male fetus based on her negative past experiences of men.

In an article so astounding it is difficult to believe it is actually true, 'Lana' even expresses surprise that ""many friends, and several of my own family members have completely cut off communication with me"".

The author purports to have fallen pregnant in 2012 and was overjoyed at the thought until she discovered she was to have a boy at which point she decided to have an abortion.

Read the full blog post here

Abortion based on gender is illegal in the UK but just this week religious groups wrote to MPs to support an amendment to the 1967 Abortion Act to clarify the point.

The amendment reads: ""Nothing in section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 can be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child.""

The practise is said to still happen in the UK particularly in ethnic communities where boys are more valued than girls.

In the blog, Lana details one of the negative experiences that was so terrible she felt she could not ""bring another monster into the world"".

The story begins aboard a plane on the way to an Occupy Wall Street rally in San Francisco. A man sat next to her upon discovering where she is going says: ""B****** like you need to learn their place.""

Lana screams ""assault"" and a male attendant rushes over but refuses to do anything as no physical contact was made.

She then admits considering lying but won't move to one of the only two spare seats as they are ""both back in Economy"".

She adds: ""I was flabbergasted, and then betrayed as they recommended that I move to one of the empty seats. This left me in tears.

""I knew the only way to get away was to move seats so I did so tearfully and having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.""

Lana then goes on how pregnancy made her feel her body had betrayed her so much she experienced ""crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war"".

Her decision to abort the fetus prompted furious comments.

""I almost threw up after reading this.""

""The most disturbing part of this is what if she didn't say yes to finding out the babies gender and had the baby to realize it was a boy, what would she have had done then?""

The agency searching for a buyer made no secret of Woods’ motivation to sell. Sabine Rollinger, of Vladi Private Islands, said the property is of little practical use to the golf superstar.

“This island was owned by Tiger Woods but after his divorce he doesn’t need an island in Sweden any more.”

Nordegren told People in May of 2014 that she and Woods live a 25-minute drive apart in Southern Florida and share custody of their two children, daughter Sam and son Charlie. The children were, at that time, 6 and 5 respectively.

“I have moved on and I am in a good place. My relationship with Tiger is centered around our children and we are doing really good — we really are — and I am so happy that is the case. He is a great father.”

Nordegren gave the interview to People as she finally received her psychology degree after nine years of chipping away at courses. She graduated with a 3.96 GPA and gave the commencement address at her institution, Rollins College. Her speech made a silent reference to her marriage to Woods.

“Education has been the only consistent part of my life the last nine years. And it has offered me comfort. Education is one thing that no one can take away from you.”

The island is in Sweden’s Lake Mälaren and boasts a villa, hunting lodge, landing strip, stables, woods, lush parks, and tee-off area. There’s also a unique historical artifact: an 11th-century Viking stronghold. But anyone who buys the property will have to ferry in a couch, since the property is listed as unfurnished.

The Boston Herald reports that after Elin and Tiger’s divorce, they sold their home in Windermere, Florida, to another golf star, left-hander Bubba Watson. Woods’ extensive Florida compound is in Hobe Sound, Florida, and Nordegren’s Florida home is in North Palm Beach.

Last year, Tiger Woods’ career earnings surpassed the $1.3 billion mark. ESPN quotes a Golf Digest report in stating that 88 percent of those earnings were for endorsements off the green. In 2013, Woods made $12 million playing golf and $71 million in endorsements.

After revelations came to light about Woods’ infidelity, his endorsement earnings dropped to an all-time low of $62 million in 2011. He made $100 million in endorsements in each of 2008 and 2009.",unrelated
118,Islamic State flying three jets in Syria: monitor,"Mexican hitmen allegedly killed more than a dozen students who went missing last month after a clash with corrupt local police, then buried them in a recently-discovered mass grave.

State prosecutors in the country said a man they arrested told how 17 of the missing youths were rounded up and killed, then thrown in pits, where badly charred remains have now been unearthed.

Authorities said that the man told them how the students, who went missing after a violent clash on September 26, were marched to the site on the outskirts of Iguala, Guerrero state before their deaths.

Hunt: A forensic investigator works at the site of the mass graves, near Iguala in Mexico

The bodies found by authorities are so damaged that they could not be identified. All that is left are bones and small pieces of flesh.

Investigators found 28 bodies there, though local officials say as many as 34 were buried across six separate pits.

It could be days before the identities of the dead are known for sure.

Security officials said earlier they believed the victims had been driven to the end of the track, walked up the hillside, executed and buried in six graves.

As investigators worked at the site, up to 2,000 protesters blocked a main highway in the Guerrero state capital of Chilpancingo demanding justice.

'You took them alive, we want them returned alive,' read a huge banner hung across the road linking Mexico City and Acapulco.

Victims: The above poster shows the 43 missing students and offers a reward for their recovery

Remote spot: Officers stand watch near the site of the mass grave on the outskirts of Iguala in Mexico

Mass grave: The roughly 30 bodies in the grave are believed to belong the group of 43 missing students

Jesus Lopez, an Acapulco street vendor whose 19-year-old son Giovani is among the missing, said he hoped the remains weren't those of the students.

Other relatives 'told us that (the remains) were burned, and that they couldn't be the kids,' Lopez said. 'But we're really nervous.'

Mexico's National Human Rights Commission opened its own investigation into the case for possible 'serious human rights abuses,' such as extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances by Iguala city police.

Police infiltrated by local drug cartels are suspected of abducting some of the students, a local security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

One security official said: 'You really can't call them police'.

He added that suspected gang members had told investigators that police had handed over the students to the people who killed them, who belonged to the gang.

Suspicion: Masked police officers stand guard atop a vehicle outside of the morgue in Iguala

Forensic workers arrive at the morgue: Relatives of the missing have given DNA samples for identification

Grim work: The remains of nine people had been brought from the hillside so far, with another 25 to follow

Heartbroken: Relatives and colleagues blockade a toll road near the site of the disappearance

Demonstration: Fellow students protested earlier this week over the dissapearance

The suspected gang members had also helped the authorities identify the site, the security official said.

Soldiers and police had cordoned off the dirt track where it ended not far from the graves, which lay about a 40-minute walk across rocky terrain inaccessible by vehicle.

The fatal clashes took place in Iguala on the night of September 26. Thirty people, including 22 police, have been arrested in connection with the violence, which claimed the lives of at least six people and left 25 injured.

Information leading to the discovery of the graves had in part come from the interrogation of local police arrested after the clashes in Iguala, the security official said.

Guerrero state, home to Iguala and the resort of Acapulco, has been one of the most lawless in the country for years.

Officials said the remains of nine people had been taken down from the hillside so far, with another 25 due to follow.",unrelated
119,J.J. Abrams Asks Disney To Move Up 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Release Date,"The Force may be with us a little sooner than expected as the latest Star Wars: The Force Awakens buzz seems to indicate that the much-awaited sci-fi's release date may be advanced, presumably amid mounting clamor by impatient fans. While different sources suggest conflicting release dates, they all indicate a much earlier premier than the originally announced December 18.

Rumor has it that director J.J. Abrams is getting fed up with the constant plot and image leaks, The Telegraph said quoting yet other industry sources. Disney has, for its part, started to go after those illegally releasing content from the film, when it asked a judge to subpoena a website that displayed a blurred image of what appeared to be a ""Sith Lord"" last week, the same report stated.
There are apparently very real fears that the story may become public knowledge even before the movie actually hits theaters before yearend. So, advancing the release date may be the director's idea of averting a potentially costly, not to mention embarrassing catastrophe, by mounting a Death Star-level pre-emptive strike on spoilers!
With a quick search of You Tube, fans can watch a one and a half minute ""official trailer"" supposedly released by Disney last November. This particular video clip begins with a helmetless Storm Trooper wandering about what could possibly be the desert of planet Tatooine. However, there could also be dozens of unofficial material floating about the Internet today!
The big question, therefore, is exactly when will the Force Awaken? Speaking at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015 recently, director Abrams was quoted as saying that he is pushing for a summer release date for Star Wars Episode 7, according to MoviePilot.
If Abrams and Disney make good on a summer release, this would put the latest Star Wars flick head to head against other much-anticipated films such as Avengers 2: Age of Ultron, Ant Man and Jurassic World, the report added.",discuss

123,North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un to open restaurant in Scotland,"The video was one of those viral sensations that tugs on your heartstrings and compels you to watch, because it defies your expectations and shows you just how kind and compassionate human beings can be. There was only one problem.

The video was a fake — at least according to a witness who says he was there while the YouTube hit, “How Does A Homeless Man Spend $100?” was filmed.

You have probably seen the video by now — if not, view it above. Posted by the prolific prankster Josh Paler Lin — whose other videos include “Sex In The Bathroom Prank” and “Rock Paper Scissors Hickey!” — the viral video purported to be a “social experiment” in which Paler Lin gave a homeless man identified as “Thomas” a hundred bucks in cash, then “secretly” filmed him as he spent the money.

The video was picked up by dozens of media outlets, including the Inquisitr, and in the week the clip has been on YouTube, has racked up more than 28 million views.

Why? Because Thomas spent his money not on booze or drugs, but on food. And not just for himself. He used the cash to purchase and distribute food to his fellow homeless people in Orange County, California.

While determining how much revenue any particular YouTube video creates is difficult, by many estimates a video can earn between $1,000 and $5,000 for each million views it accumulates.

That means Paler Lin may have grossed anywhere from $28,000 to $140,000 off this single video — in one week.

Perhaps more important, Paler Lin created a crowdfunding campaign along with the video, to raise more money for Thomas. That campaign has so far brought in about $130,000 in donations from people moved by the selfless acts Thomas performs in the video.

But in an interview posted on the site Vocativ on Tuesday, Taugan Tan Kadalim, who says he stumbled by chance across Paler Lin filming the video and witnessed the whole thing, calls the entire scenario “bull****.”

Kadalim, 26, says that he was there at Euclid Liquor & Market where he had just purchased a lottery ticket before walking across the street to his girlfriend’s apartment, and that what he saw made it clear that “Thomas knew he was being followed.”

Kadalim says he is a fan of Paler Lin and recognized the YouTube celebrity immediately.

He then watched as Paler Lin entered the liquor store and spoke with a clerk as Thomas waited outside. Only after Paler Lin returned, Kadalim told Vocativ, did Thomas enter the liquor store.

“He drove Thomas to the liquor store,” Kadalim told the site. “While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.”

Vocativ said its reporters corroborated the story with Kadalim’s girlfriend and brother, but calls to the liquor store went unreturned. Kadalim posted a comment to the video’s YouTube page the day the video went on line, saying quote clearly that Paler Lin drove Thomas to the store, but the comment went largely ignored.

Paler Lin, however, adamantly denied faking any part of the “homeless” viral video, telling Vocativ, “There is no way we’re making any of this up. This is real.”",unrelated
124,Eyewitness Says Viral Video of Homeless Man Was Staged,"(CNN) -- Boko Haram laughed off Nigeria's announcement of a ceasefire agreement, saying there is no such deal and schoolgirls abducted in spring have been converted to Islam and married off.

Nigerian officials announced two weeks ago that they had struck a deal with the Islamist terror group.

The deal, the government said, included the release of more than 200 girls whose kidnapping in April at a boarding school in the nation's north stunned the world.

In a video released Saturday, the Islamist group's notorious leader fired off a series of denials.

""Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?"" Abubakar Shekau said. ""They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.""

Shekau slammed reports of their planned release.

""We married them off. They are in their marital homes,"" he said, chuckling.

The group's leader also denied knowing the negotiator with whom the government claimed it worked out a deal, saying he does not represent Boko Haram.

""We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,"" he said of the negotiator.

It wasn't clear when the video was made.

Mike Omeri, coordinator of Nigeria's National Information Centre, told CNN on Saturday that all these claims contradict those made in conversations in which the Nigerian government has been involved.

Omeri said Nigeria's government will do everything possible to verify the claims made in the video.

Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to the aide.

The ceasefire deal announced October 17 followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.

After the deal was announced, the aide said final negotiations on the girls' release would be completed at a meeting a week later in Chad.

That day passed without any signs of the girls.

Boko Haram a growing challenge

In the video, Shekau talked not of peace but of more violence -- promising more ""war, striking and killing with gun.""

This strategy appears to be playing out in parts of Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire. More people have been abducted and scores killed in recent weeks, including one attack a day after the ceasefire that left eight dead.

Days later, members of the Islamist terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria, residents said Thursday.

Heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted, residents said.

For its part, the Nigerian government isn't backing down.

Rather, it is stepping up its military campaign against militants and criminals in some parts of the West African nation, Nigeria's defense ministry said on Saturday.

The military claimed its airstrikes and ground operations have repelled attacks against civilians in Adamawa and Borno, two of the states in northeastern Nigeria that have been strongholds and frequent targets for Boko Haram.

Officials are ""studying"" the latest video, even as the military continues to recognize the talks aimed at assuring the release of the kidnapped schoolgirls, the ministry said.

Boko Haram, whose name translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the Hausa language, is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Like ISIS, it has ambitions for a caliphate, or religious state.

The group's attacks have intensified in recent years in an apparent show of defiance for the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the government.

As part of its insurgency, it has bombed schools, churches and mosques, kidnapped women and children and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

125,New Audio Shows Michael Brown Was Shot at 11 Times,"A hoax story alleging the British graffiti artist Banksy has been arrested and has had his identity revealed has once again duped thousands of people online.

According to the highly refutable website National Report, a 'news' website consisting entirely of fake stories, the artist was arrested by Metropolitan Police at his studio and his identity revealed as 35-year-old Paul Horner, originally from Liverpool.

The article contains all the elements you would expect to see from a news story covering an arrest, including details from police and quotes from those close to Banksy.

However, it only takes the bare minimum of fact-checking and research to spot that this story is a hoax.

The article claims the story has been confirmed by the BBC (it hasn't) and that City of London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy's arrest (he never did and Edwards doesn't even exist).

US news site CNN also did not conduct an interview with Banksy's ""project manager"" John Hawes following his arrest (also because he doesn't exist).

The 'revealed identity' of Banksy is also suspicious.

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users $2.99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15-year-old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager's house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4.

The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics, a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who, unsurprisingly since his previous stories include 'Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month' and 'Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis', has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism.

One final, major clue that the story is a hoax is that the exact same thing has happened before. Last February, a fake press release that again claimed Banksy has been arrested and again claimed his name is Paul Horner did the rounds, with Jezebel being one of the more high-profile websites to publish the hoax before later taking it down.

Despite this, the latest 'Banksy arrested' story has been shared more than 200,000 times on Facebook and Twitter, proving there are still people who will believe anything they read on the internet.

It was said Kim Yo Jong had taken over while her brother underwent medical treatment, but So Se Pyong, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told Reuters Kim was not in bad health.

The ambassador sat down for an interview where he discussed a variety of matters, including North Korea's nuclear program, possibly negotiations to free three detained Americans and, of course, Kim’s health.

It has been rumored Kim, 31, might have had ankle surgery, but So said that is incorrect. The story emerged after Kim did not appear at the Supreme People's Assembly last month and reports said he suffered from ""discomfort.” He was also seen walking with a limp in July. ""That is rumors, fabricated rumors,"" So said about Kim's alleged ailment.

Questions about Kim’s health rose after an article from the Diplomat, a magazine based in Tokyo, claimed his sister was making important government decisions while Kim was being treated at Bonghwa Clinic in North Korea's capital Pyongyang.

""Some say Hwang Byong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo Jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,"" Kim Heung Gwang, the head of North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, reportedly said.

Even if So denies any health problems, Kim has not been seen by his people since Sept. 3. The leader also gained a significant amount of weight, which could contribute to ailments like gout, diabetes or high blood pressure, sources told the Associated Press. If he were suffering from gout, his cheese eating and smoking would worsen the condition.

Dramatic footage has emerged of a US marine being shot in the head by a Taliban sniper, only to be saved by his Kevlar helmet.

The video was captured on the helmet camera of a marine in 2013, when he and two other marines were taking part in a reconnaissance mission in the NawZad district of the renowned Helmand Province, Afghanistan.

130,Militant Group Says It Killed American Journalist in Syria,"Islamic State militants appear to have killed missing American journalist James Wright Foley, if a video that surfaced Tuesday is to be believed. 

Foley was a freelancer who frequently reported for the Global Post and Agence France-Presse about ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. When Foley first disappeared in Syria, reports indicated that he had been captured by pro-government forces. Instead, it appears that his captors were members of ISIS. He had previously been kidnapped in Libya. 

The video that surfaced Tuesday first shows a clip from President Obama's press conference calling for air strikes against ""the terrorist group ISIL."" About halfway in, a man believed to be Foley speaks in English to his family. He's on his knees, with an ISIS guard standing over him. In a [likely ISIS-scripted] speech, he blames Obama and the U.S. government for his impending death and implores his family not to take a penny from the government. He then addresses his brother, John, who is in the U.S. Air Force. 

""I died that day, John,"" he says, referring to U.S. air strikes against the militant group. ""When your colleagues dropped that bomb on those people, they signed my death certificate.""

When the video reorients itself to focus back on Foley and his executioner, the mike previously hooked up to his shirt is gone. The militant spouts off an angry tirade against the United States, and the camera cuts away after the first few seconds of the beheading. 

At the end of the video, ISIS militants parade another captive journalist, Steven Sotloff, who they threaten will be the next victim if the U.S. government's policy toward the militant group doesn't change.

According to a report on Sunday from The New York Times, the New York Police Department (NYPD) is planning to announce new guidelines that would allow those found in possession of small amounts of marijuana to walk away with a ticket instead of spending time in handcuffs.

The change in policy could have wide-ranging effects in a city known for arresting thousands citizens each year for marijuana possession.

If true, the change in policy could also have a significant impact on the city's black and Hispanic community, which some studies say are disproportionately affected by the police department's current marijuana arrest policy.

The upcoming shift in enforcement, which the report says is something of a throwback to the city's policy in the late '70s, comes just days after Alaska, Oregon and Washington D.C. voted to legalize cannabis, joining Colorado and Washington, events that may point toward a national trend.

134,Islamic State claims to have beheaded American journalist,"A DESPERATE mother was tricked into feasting on cooked meat from the body of her son by Islamic State militants, it has been claimed.

The famished Kurdish mother had gone to plead with the jihadists to release her son.

Cruel militants delayed talks with the elderly mum – feeding her a meal made with the corpse of her offspring while she waited.

The depraved story was relayed by a brave Briton fighting on the front line with Kurdish forces against the Islamic State, also referred to as IS, ISIS and ISIL.

Yasir Abdulla left behind his wife and children at their Yorkshire home for six months to battle for his Kurdish homeland.

The 36-year-old said the disturbing story was the cause of his hatred against IS – and one of the reasons he has vowed to return to his war-ravaged native county and ""finish the job"".

The father-of-four told The Sun: ""I hate IS because of what happened to an old Kurdish woman from a nearby tribe.

""Her son was captured by IS fighters and taken as a prisoner to Mosul. She was determined to find her son and went to IS headquarters and asked to see him.

""The IS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

""They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were so kind.

But security guard Mr Abdulla then adds: ""They had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said, 'You've just EATEN him'.""

""They burn people alive, they chop off people's heads, there is no limit to their depravity.

""They are not Muslims, they have hijacked Islam. All they do is hate.""

The shocking account is just the latest in a string of disturbing executions and punishments administered by the immoral group.

In February, IS released a highly-choreographed propaganda film showing Jordanian fighter pilot Lieutenant Mouath al-Kasaesbeh soaked in fuel and being burned alive inside a cage.

Another video from the organisation showed a man believed to be gay thrown from a seven-storey building. The 50-year-old man, who was blindfolded throughout his sickening fall, is seen to be still alive after hitting the ground below.

He was later stoned to his death by a waiting mob.

Some have interpreted the perceived increase in brutality from the Islamic State as a sign of their weakness.

The terror organisation have suffered a number of defeats recently, including the loss of two strongholds in Iraq.

Last week, Kurdish gunmen stormed the town of Tel Hamis and fought back control from Islamic State rebels.

The group, aided by US-led coalition airstrikes, previously won back the seized border town of Kobani.

Infamous Islamic State militant Jihadi John, who is believed to have orchestrated the beheadings of dozens of hostages, was last week unmasked as a hypocritical cannabis smoker from west London.

Fearless Mr Abdulla, speaking after temporarily returning to his family home in Keighley, West Yorkshire, said: ""IS are very good at making people scared.

""If they make one person scared then that person will make another person scared and soon everyone is scared of IS.

""But the Kurds are not scared of them. Someone has to stand and fight. We have got thousands of people in many villages and towns behind us.

However, little has been known about the woman-behind-the-hands of the popular YouTube channel. In fact, her face is never shown in the video, only her voice, toys and hands. However, a recent report reveals the true identity of the YouTube hit and the identity is somewhat shocking. A former Brazilian porn star is behind the wholesome Disney videos and it is noted that during the early years of “Disney Collector,” the woman was filming both Disney unboxing videos and porn in the same Florida home.

The Daily Mail reports that Brazilian Daiane DeJeus, also known as Sandy Summers in the porn industry, is the woman behind the hit Disney Collector Youtube videos. Reporters tracked down information on DeJeus that aligns with public records information regarding the widely popular DC Toy Collector YouTube channel. After tracking down DeJeus, the reporters spoke with family and friends who confirmed that Daiane was behind the million dollar videos.

DeJeus has went to unfathomable measures to ensure her identity remained secret and for good reason. The target market of the YouTube channel, which caters to Disney lovers such as children and families, may not remain viewers if they knew the owner’s secret. DeJeus was not only a Disney fanatic, but also a porn star. Going by the name Sandy Summers, Dejeus filmed numerous x-rated videos for the adult film industry in the same home that she filmed some of her early DC Toy Collector features.

Family and friends have identified DeJeus as the mystery unboxer and note that certain physical features on the woman’s hands and arms can be seen in many of the YouTube videos.

“They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.”

Aside from the physical similarities, former neighbors say DeJeus has an unmistakable voice and say that many people on the street knew what she was up to.

‘That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere. Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.”

Would you have ever imagined that the popular DC Toy Collector videos were being filmed in the same house as adult films by a porn star?

136,US probing claims ISIS fighters seized airdropped weapons meant for Kurds,"Eleven commercial jets have reportedly been stolen in recent weeks in Libya, and Western intelligence agencies have begun warning they could be used in terror attacks on Sept. 11, the anniversary of the devastating Osama bin Laden-orchestrated attacks on New York and Washington that left nearly 3,000 dead.
According to a report in the Free Beacon, the jets were taken by Islamist militias in Libya, and reports distributed within the U.S. government “included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack … on the date marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks …”

One official in the report assembled by the highly respected Bill Gertz said, “There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

Gertz now is senior editor of the Free Beacon, but he built his career during 27 years as reporter, editor and columnist with the Washington Times. He’s also authored six books and his online biography reveals the state-run Xinhua news agency in 2006 identified him as the No. 1 “anti-China expert” in the world.

His report about the missing jetliners notes authorities have a high level of concern because of the convergence of the cases of missing airplanes and the 13th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.

It also is just two years after the Sept. 11 terror attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, a scandal that still is reverberating through the Obama administration and threatening to become a game-changer for the 2014 elections.

Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in that attack.

What do YOU think? Do you fear for America’s safety? Sound off in today’s WND poll.

A State Department official declined comment, Gertz reported.

The officials quoted by Gertz said U.S. intelligence agencies now are trying to locate all the airplanes belonging to two Libyan airline companies, and they have not confirmed the aircraft theft, which reportedly happened after the takeover by terrorists of Tripoli International Airport in August.

“The state-owned Libyan Airlines fleet until this summer included 14 passenger and cargo jetliners, including seven Airbus 320s, one Airbus 330, two French ATR-42 turboprop aircraft, and four Bombardier CJR-900s,” the report said. “Libyan state-owned Afriqiyah Airways fleet is made up of 13 aircraft, including three Airbus 319s, seven Airbus 320s, two Airbus 330s, and one Airbus 340.”

The report blames Libyan Dawn, one of the terror organizations operating there, for the alleged thefts in late August.

Following the warnings from Western intelligence agencies, Tunisia halted flights from Tripoli, Sirte and Misrata because of the potential the jets would appear in suicide missions, the report said.

And Egypt halted flights to and from Libya.

Gertz said military components from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt were put on a higher level of alert.

Libya has been an uncontrolled disaster area since the Obama administration engineered the removal in 2011 of strongman Muammar Gadhafi from office. His departure left terror factions struggling for control as the nation plunged into chaos.

Both Libyan Dawn and another group called Ansar al-Shariah were declared by Libya’s parliament to be terror groups. The report said Ansar al-Shariah reportedly has surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft guns and rocket-propelled grenades, among other weapons.

Abderrahmane Mekkaoui, a Moroccan military expert, explained to Al Jazeera broadcasting that “credible intelligence” reports say the jets are intended for use by a group called Masked Men Brigade for attacks on the 9/11 date.

Gertz reported that a counterterrorism expert, Sebastian Gorka, explained the events that could develop with the stolen jets.

“The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept. 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,” he said.

“The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,” he said.

Gertz’s report noted the planes themselves become an agent of destruction.

“Who needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes?” asked Michael Rubin, of the American Enterprise Institute. “Even empty, but loaded up with fuel, they can be as devastating.”",unrelated
137,Meteorite 'caused mysterious boom in Nicaragua',"UTAH COUNTY — Over the years, holiday office Christmas parties have gained a reputation for crazy antics. Often, there's a lot of heavy drinking. One overly zealous drinker in Utah County nearly killed himself a couple of weeks ago, winding up in the hospital for three days.

Even though the drinks at the party contained no alcohol, a heavy drink nearly put Ryan Roche out of commission for the holidays.

""I think it was one of those spur of the moment kind of things,"" Roche said.

As his holiday office party wound down earlier this month, Roche headed for the door with his wife and kids.

""They busted out some eggnog.""

An eggnog-chugging contest was getting started, and one of Roche's colleagues called him out to compete. Roche said he's a competitive guy and couldn't walk away.

""I've already decided, if I'm going to do it, I'm going to win,"" he said.

The record at that point was 22 seconds. There was a Ruth's Chris Steak House gift card on the line, so Roche faced off against two other co-workers.

""I just opened up my throat, didn't even swallow,"" he said. ""I pretty much poured it down.""

I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably. I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.
–Ryan Roche
As the video shows, he drank a quart of eggnog in just 12 seconds, without taking a breath.

""I got done, and I was gasping, I couldn't breathe.""

Roche said he was coughing a lot as he headed home, but thought he would be OK. A couple of hours later, he wasn't so sure.

""I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably,"" he said. ""I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.""

He asked a friend in medical school to come over to his house and check on him. The friend took him to the hospital.

Roche had aspirated the eggnog to his lungs and was essentially ""dry drowning,"" the doctors told him.

""They pretty much had to wheelchair me in, double IV, oxygen, and hooked me up to what they call the nuclear weapon of antibiotics,"" he said.

The liquid in his lungs was starting an infection. He spent 24 hours in intensive care with a fever, sweats and chills.

""It was rough,"" he said. ""Eggnog: not ideal for the lungs.""

On day three in the hospital, doctors took him off oxygen, and he went home. After about a week, he was back at full strength.

It was a holiday mishap he'll never forget, and also probably never live down. Roche did win, but at quite a price.

""Not only do I get a Ruth's Chris gift card, but I got a three night's stay in the hospital.""",unrelated

After being dumped by her boyfriend, Tan Shen says she was walking the city feeling depressed when she decided to stop into a KFC outlet in a train station in Chengdu China, reports Metro UK.

After ordering some chicken wings, Shen realized going back to her apartment would be too difficult.

“I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings. But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think,” Shen said. “I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.”

Luckily for Shen, the place where she camped out is open for 24 hours. At first, the lovesick woman went unnoticed by employees since they work in different shifts.

""At first no one really noticed her. But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar. Then I realized we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left,” Jiang Li Lung, a KFC employee said.

Shen ordered more wings and fries and continued to stay in her booth. After a week, local media reportedly started flocking to the restaurant so Shen decided it was time to leave.

""I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my parents. I had already told work I was off sick, so phoned them and said I was leaving,” Shen said.

But her best line ever?

""And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore.""

139,Hope Fades for Girls' Release After Boko Haram 'Truce' Breached,"ABUJA, Nigeria — The leader of Nigeria's Islamist extremist group dashed hopes for the release of 200 kidnapped girls Saturday, denying reports of a truce with the government.

In a new video message, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau says the schoolgirls have converted to Islam and married off. ""The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,"" he says, laughing.

The news goes counter to what the Nigerian government said nearly two weeks ago when it announced a cease-fire deal with the terrorist organization, raising hopes among the families of the kidnapped girls — who were taken from the northeastern Nigerian town of Chibok in April — that their daughters would soon be released.

But as the weeks dragged on with no sign of the kidnapped girls, hopes began to fade.

""I was very excited when I heard the news — I will finally reunite with my daughter,"" said Hamidah Amira, 36, whose 17-year-old daughter was kidnapped. But then desperation set in, especially as Boko Haram abducted dozens of young women and teenagers in northeast Nigeria and continued to launch attacks that forced hundreds to flee.

Despite those incidents, the government insisted negotiations with the Islamists were ongoing in Chad, as some began to raise doubts a cease-fire was even agreed upon by the group.

Martin Ewi, senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies' office in Pretoria, said he didn't think Boko Haram had agreed to a truce, citing the lack of public statements on the issue in the past two weeks.

""The government might be talking to one faction … and then you have the other factions which might not have bought into the idea of dialogue,"" he said.

Human Rights Watch estimates Boko Haram, whose name loosely translates as ""Western education is forbidden,"" has abducted around 500 young women over the past five years.

Although some girls managed to escape from the Islamists, the whereabouts and the fate of the rest of the young women are uncertain.

A recent Human Rights Watch report, based on interviews with victims and witnesses of Boko Haram abductions, offers rare insight into a series of physical and sexual abuses the girls suffer in captivity, including rape, forced labor and beating.

""We found that the Nigerian government has never interviewed these girls, never really found out or learned what they've gone through, never attempted to do any kind of investigations,"" said Rona Peligal, Human Rights Watch deputy director for the Africa Division. ""They were kind of left on their own.""

Chibok resident Solomon Ali is deeply critical of the government's handling of the situation since the beginning.

""We were disappointed that the government has done nothing to ensure these girls are released,"" he said, adding officials have failed to keep the community informed.

Outraged by the kidnappings and the atrocities committed by Boko Haram, the international community has urged the Nigerian government to step up its efforts to free the girls. Since April, a campaign under the motto ""Bring Back Our Girls"" went viral on social media.

Peligal says Nigerian authorities should do a better job responding to the Boko Haram threat and ensuring protection around schools.

""The government needs to better anticipate and plan for those kinds of abductions because they're continuing,"" she said. ""And the government should respond capably.""

Ewi worries the girls would not be freed unless the government yields to Boko Haram's demands to release some of their militants.

""You can't pursue military operations and still be hoping to release the girls alive,"" he said.

Analysts warn the situation is likely to get worse in the months ahead of the 2015 election. Earlier this week, President Goodluck Jonathan, who is under increasing scrutiny for his failure to locate the girls, confirmed he would be running for re-election.

""The Boko Haram issue has been indeed politicized, and I expect it would be further politicized as we get closer to the election,"" said Peligal.

In the meantime, Amira — like other moms — waits, while making a personal appeal to Boko Haram to release her daughter and the other girls.

""They should sympathize with us, not with the government,"" Amira said.

140,ISIS cracks down on five confirmed Ebola cases among fighters: official,"Amazon has warehouses — hundreds of them, miles of them. It has lockers and pop-up shipping containers. But it's never had a true, physical retail store, at least not until now. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Amazon plans to open its first physical store, and that it will be located in midtown Manhattan, right in the heart of New York City. It'll be located on 34th Street, right between the flagship Macy's store and the Empire State Building.

In a way, the store will reportedly be just an extension of what Amazon already does in its physical spaces. Amazon will accept returns at the location, and will use it as a mini-warehouse particularly tuned for same-day delivery of products in New York. You'll also be able to pick up online orders at the store, meaning you'll be able to buy online and get items even faster. Amazon may also use the store to show off its Kindle and Fire products, which seems like a spectacularly obvious thing to do but is evidently still only being considered.

Of course, there's potential to do much more. Amazon's been building to this: the company launched a tool for identifying products, a card-reader for buying them, and much more that suggests it could quickly build a full-fledged physical retail space. It's been rumored for years that Amazon would do this, and even now Amazon tells the Journal that this is just an experiment.

The store is apparently slated to be open in time for the holidays, and could be the beginning of an entirely new branch of competition between Amazon and its biggest brick-and-mortar competitors.",unrelated
141,Nasa questions whether crater in Nicaragua caused by meteorite,"Nicaragua's government said that a mysterious boom heard in the capital was made by a small meteorite that left a crater in a wooded area near Managua's airport.

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said on Sunday that a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a ""relatively small"" meteorite that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth"".

Murillo said Nicaragua would ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.

The crater left by the meteorite has a radius of 12 metres and is 5 metres deep, said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it was still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.

Humberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Centre at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet on Saturday night.

""We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,"" he said.

Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""

Local residents reported hearing a loud boom on Saturday night, but said they did not see anything strange in the sky.

""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria told the Associated Press.

The site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit.",discuss
142,Fears Islamic State could launch EBOLA attack on Britain after fighters 'contract virus',"An Israeli-Canadian woman who traveled to Iraq to fight alongside the Kurds there earlier this month has been abducted by Islamic State fighters, Hebrew media reported Sunday, citing Syrian jihadist-linked media.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, was captured by jihadists near the flashpoint city of Kobani in the past few days, reports said. The former IDF soldier and Canada native was taken after the jihadists launched three suicide bombings in the area, and her condition is unknown.


The reports were not initially confirmed by the Islamic State group. In Israel, the Foreign Ministry said it was looking into the reports while stressing that the websites that carried the information were “of dubious credibility.”

Two Kurdish fighters quoted by Israel Radio cast doubt on the reports. One, an American fighter, said Rosenberg was never in Kobani. Another soldier on the ground said that he had heard nothing of her alleged abduction.

In her last Facebook post to date, Rosenberg wrote on November 20 that someone would be managing her profile for two weeks, and asked that people not message her “as this is not me.”

IS launched an attack Saturday on the Syrian border town of Kobani from Turkey, a Kurdish official and activists said, although Turkey denied that the fighters had used its territory for the raid.

The assault began when a suicide bomber driving an armored vehicle detonated an explosive device on the border crossing between Kobani and Turkey, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria’s powerful Kurdish Democratic Union Party.

The Islamic State group “used to attack the town from three sides,” Khalil said. “Today, they are attacking from four sides.”

The Islamic State group claimed three suicide attacks in Kobani’s border crossing point, the SITE Intelligence Group reported. The group, quoting Twitter accounts linked to the militants, said the suicide attacks were carried out by a Saudi and a Turkmen, adding that one of them was driving a Humvee.

The first foreign woman to join the Kurdish forces, Rosenberg set out from her home in Tel Aviv on November 2, stopping in Amman before flying to Erbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

Rosenberg told Israel Radio that she wanted to do her part for the Kurdish national struggle, and that she was hopeful her experience in the Israel Defense Forces would be useful to the Kurds.

According to Rosenberg’s Facebook page, she served in the IDF’s Home Front Command.

Rosenberg has posted pictures of herself in mountains of Iraq and Syrian Kurdistan.

“In the IDF, we say Aharai – After Me. Let’s show ISIS what that means,” she wrote, using an alternate acronym for Islamic State.

In 2009, Rosenberg was arrested in a joint Israeli police and FBI operation on suspicion that she had been part of a ring that cheated elderly American citizens out of their money by posing as lottery officials and convincing the unsuspecting seniors to pay for fictive services, according to the Walla news site. The members of the ring, which included 11 other Israeli citizens aside from Rosenberg, were said to have stolen up to $25 million.

Rosenberg was later convicted of the crime and sentenced to four years in a US prison, though her term was eventually shortened and she was deported to Israel instead, Channel 10 reported.

The Islamic State group began its Kobani offensive in mid-September, capturing parts of the town as well as dozens of nearby villages. The town later became the focus of airstrikes by the US-led coalition against the militants.

Kurdish fighters slowly have been advancing in Kobani since late October, when dozens of well-armed Iraqi peshmerga fighters joined fellow Syrian Kurds in the battles. The fighting has killed hundreds of fighters on both sides over the past two months.

If confirmed, Rosenberg would be the second Israeli captive held by the jihadist group. Israeli-American journalist Steven Sotloff was beheaded by the Islamic State group in early September. Sotloff went missing in Syria in August 2013, and the jihadists were reportedly unaware of his Jewish heritage and Israeli citizenship until after his death.

143,Court Orders Probe Into Complaints Of 'Forced Castration' In Religious 'Dera' Sect,"Amazon is reportedly planning to launch an ad-supported media streaming service for music and videos, the New York Post reports.

The service would exist in addition to its $99 Prime membership subscription, which includes free, two-day shipping on thousands of items alongside music, TV, and movie streaming options.

The Wall Street Journal reported similar plans in March, pegging the service as being free. At the time, Amazon denied that it had plans to offer a free streaming-media service.

The Post, however, doesn't say that the service would be free, and instead suggests that the new service would likely compete with Netflix and Hulu, while under-cutting them on price (Netflix costs and Hulu Plus cost $7.99 a month).

Amazon's Sally Fouts sent the following via email: ""We currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our First Episode Free feature on Amazon Instant Video, and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers. We’re often experimenting with new offers and experiences for customers, but we have not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service.""

At its core, the idea of this service makes sense.

Amazon could use this new, cheaper streaming service as a way to ease people into its ecosystem so they'll be more likely to eventually make the jump to Prime, while also giving it a way to entice potential customers who don't care about Prime's free shipping but want a Netflix alternative.

148,Amazon plans ad-supported video streaming service - NY post,"Every superhero has an origin story, but one Russian boy’s unbelievable tale isn’t from a comic book — it’s very much real-life.

Twelve-year-old Nikolai Kryaglyachenko was walking home from school one day when he stopped to lean against a lamppost.

Unfortunately for Nikolai, the lamppost had a faulty wire and the schoolboy was blasted across the street by a jolt of electricity.

“When I came round, I felt groggy, but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened. When I woke up the next day and got out of bed, I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest,” Nikolai revealed.

Being a comic book fan, Nikolai immediately set about testing his new power, which is eerily similar to the power wielded by Marvel character Magneto.

“I can do things I couldn’t do before, but I don’t have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass — it just moved towards me,” he said.

Naturally, Nikolai’s schoolmates were fascinated by his new power, but what they didn’t know was that he could pass his ability to others, turning them into human magnets, too.

“I could even hang a ladle on my nose,” said classmate Vika Balandina.

Nikolai is not the first real-life Magneto. In fact, an entire Russian family got magnetism superpower in 1987.

A year after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, Leonid Tenkaev, his wife, Galina, their daughter Tanya and grandson Kolya were all able to stick metal objects to their bodies, according to The Guardian.

When they discovered their powers, Russian and Japanese scientists examined the family and verified that their seeming magnetism was real.

“There is absolutely no doubt that the objects stick as if their bodies were magnetic,” said Dr. Atusi Kono in 1991.

Another famous real-life Magneto revealed herself at a Superfields conference of 300 “human magnets” in 1990.

149,CBI registers 'criminal conspiracy' case against Dera chief after claims 400 male followers were forcibly castrated,"Multi-millionaire religious ""guru"" Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh persuaded around 400 of his estimated 50 million followers worldwide to cut off their own testicles to ""bring them closer to God"".  The details of the bizarre incident have only just come to light despite reportedly taking place in 2000 at a hospital run by Ram Rahim in India.  India's Central Bureau of Investigation has reportedly accused Ram Rahim of grievous bodily harm and he is under investigation. He has previously been questioned over the murder of an investigative journalist in 2002 and has also been accused of sexual assault by female followers but has never been charged.  Navkiran Singh, who is the lawyer for Hans Raj Chauhan, the only castration victim so far to come forward, said his client and other victims believed they would become social outcasts if they refused to perform the ""operation"" demanded of them by Ram Rahim. ""They were told that only those who get castrated will be able to meet God,"" said Navkiran, in a report in the Daily Mail.  Ram Rahim, 47, dubbed the ""guru in bling"", is head of the socio-political organisation Dera Sacha Sauda and is estimated to be worth £26m. The guru stars in a spectacular new movie, Messenger of God, in which he appears to walk on air, tear tree trunks in half and perform other miracles. Though 157,000 people are thought to have attended the film's premiere in Gurgaon, near Delhi, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, the revelations have caused sales of tickets for the movie to dwindle dramatically.  Gurus are big business in India, where their endorsements can help political parties get elected, and where millions of people seek spiritual guidance every year. Sathya Sai Baba, who was said to be able to conjure ash from thin air, was worth an estimated US$7bn when he died.  Even after death, some gurus retain a hold over devotees.

150,Shots Heard In Alleged Brown Shooting Recording [AUDIO],"Video messaging app Glide on Thursday said it has verified the authenticity and timestamp of a recording that a Ferguson, Missouri resident captured as a police officer shot 18-year-old Michael Brown to death on a residential street.

While the anonymous Glide user was chatting with a friend, the sounds of what appear to be gunshots can be heard in the background (CNN video below). The user turned over the video to the FBI as evidence. Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg told CNN he detected six shots, followed by four more after a brief pause. An autopsy report commissioned by Brown's family said the unarmed man was shot at least six times. A Glide representative told the Washington Post the video is ""absolutely"" authentic.

""While tragedy is never good news, and our hearts go out to the family of Michael Brown, this incident underscores how technology is changing the landscape of not only journalism, but also criminology,"" Glide said in a blog post. ""Because Glide is the only messaging application using streaming video technology, each message is simultaneously recorded and transmitted, so the exact time can be verified to the second. In this case, the video in question was created at 12:02:14 PM CDT on Saturday, August 9th.""",discuss
151,Armed U.S. drones spotted flying over Syria in possible hunt for ISIS leader,"Activists in Al Raqqa have posted images online purporting to show a U.S. Predator drone orbiting the skies of the north-east Syrian city, the chosen “capital” of the Islamic State militant group.

The 16-member activist group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently provided the images to various online publications. Their handheld imagery corresponds with a video uploaded to Youtube on Sept. 6.

In recent months, RIBSS has provided most of the documentation coming out of the conflict-ridden city, as almost no local or foreign journalists are present—due, of course, to Islamic State’s suppression and murder of journalists.

Last year, rebel groups overran government forces in Al Raqqa. Within several months, Islamists came to dominate the city, with Islamic State eventually coming out on top. Last month, the group took over the entire province when it pushed the remaining government forces out of one last military base.

Islamic State’s territorial gains in Syria and Iraq continue to put considerable pressure on the United States to do more than send advisers to Iraq.

In August, U.S. president Barack Obama authorized air strikes against Islamic State forces in Iraq. U.S. Central Command has launched 131 air strikes across the country—most around Irbil and the Mosul Dam.

The appearance of Predator in Syrian skies could indicate U.S. planning for possible air strikes in Syria, as well.

American planes and drones are flying around 60 surveillance flights evvery day over Islamic State territory, according to Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby.",discuss
152,"Oh Hey, Paul Rudd Was One Of The Dallas Airport Homophobe Heroes, No Big","TEXAS CITY, Texas (AP) — A Texas plumber is getting some unwanted attention after one of his old company vehicles appeared in a photo posted on an Islamic militant group's social media account.

Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City has been flooded with calls after the picture appeared on Twitter, The Galveston County Daily News reported.

The picture was posted online by the Islamic extremist group Ansar al-Deen Front, according to a CBS News report.

The photo shows a black pickup truck with a Mark-1 Plumbing decal on the door and an anti-aircraft gun in the bed.

Mark Oberholtzer, who has owned the company for 32 years, said he traded that truck at an AutoNation dealership three years ago and has no idea how it ended up in Syria. He usually takes the decals off his vehicles when he sells them but he left it on this vehicle, believing AutoNation would remove it.

""They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn't do it,"" Oberholtzer said. ""How it ended up in Syria, I'll never know.""

Oberholtzer said his business has received a thousand calls and faxes this week about the photo.

""A few of the people are really ugly,"" he said.

Oberholtzer said he just wanted people to know the vehicle was no longer his.

""I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth,"" he said.

153,Tourist wakes to find strange red trail on his stomach - and discovers a spider has burrowed through his appendix scar and crawled UNDER his skin while on holiday in Bali,"Amazon has warehouses — hundreds of them, miles of them. It has lockers and pop-up shipping containers. But it's never had a true, physical retail store, at least not until now. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Amazon plans to open its first physical store, and that it will be located in midtown Manhattan, right in the heart of New York City. It'll be located on 34th Street, right between the flagship Macy's store and the Empire State Building.

In a way, the store will reportedly be just an extension of what Amazon already does in its physical spaces. Amazon will accept returns at the location, and will use it as a mini-warehouse particularly tuned for same-day delivery of products in New York. You'll also be able to pick up online orders at the store, meaning you'll be able to buy online and get items even faster. Amazon may also use the store to show off its Kindle and Fire products, which seems like a spectacularly obvious thing to do but is evidently still only being considered.

Of course, there's potential to do much more. Amazon's been building to this: the company launched a tool for identifying products, a card-reader for buying them, and much more that suggests it could quickly build a full-fledged physical retail space. It's been rumored for years that Amazon would do this, and even now Amazon tells the Journal that this is just an experiment.

The store is apparently slated to be open in time for the holidays, and could be the beginning of an entirely new branch of competition between Amazon and its biggest brick-and-mortar competitors.",unrelated
154,ISIS Video: America’s Air Dropped Weapons Now in Our Hands,"In a new video posted online, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claims it has captured weapons and ammunition dropped by the U.S. military that was intended for Kurdish forces defending an embattled Syrian city near the Turkish border.

The airdrops Sunday were the first of their kind and followed weeks of U.S. and coalition airstrikes in and near Kobani.

In the video, ISIS claims some of the weapons and ammunition was air-dropped by mistake on its positions in Kobani.



A senior administration official told CBS News on Sunday that the majority - but not necessarily all - of the bundles dropped by U.S. forces appeared to ‎make it to their intended targets.

""We are still assessing the completion of the mission but every indication that we have is that the vast majority of those bundles were successfully delivered to Kurdish forces,"" the official said. ""We're still working through a complete assessment right now.‎""

Because the drops were made overnight, the Pentagon could not say with 100 certainty that they reached their intended destinations.

Idris Nassan, a senior Kurdish official from Kobani who is now in the Turkish town of Mursitpinar, confirmed the Kurdish fighters received the airdrop and asked for more weapons.

""We are not in need of fighters. We are able to defeat the terrorists of ISIS if we have weaponry - enough weaponry and enough ammunition,"" he told The Associated Press.

Kurdish fighters tweeted messages of appreciation along with photos that apparently show that some of the air-dropped cargo - including M-16 guns and medical supplies - did reach its intended recipients.",discuss

To Parents.

The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.

It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.

A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses.

The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.

The image was uploaded by Reddit user fryd_ on Saturday morning. He spoke to BuzzFeed News about it:

I came across the pamphlet whilst playing Lego with my niece & nephew at their Grandma’s house and it struck me as particularly modern message for something written 40 years ago. I thought the toy-makers of today could learn a thing or two!

Lego famously had egalitarian advertising in the 1970s and 1980s, this poster is from 1981.

157,Two GOP Congressmen Say Suspected Terrorists Caught Crossing U.S.–Mexico Border,"U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter this week declared terrorists have been crossing the Rio Grande.

The California Republican, speaking to Greta Van Susteren on Fox News Oct. 7, 2014, said he’d learned from the U.S. Border Patrol that Islamic State fighters had been nabbed trying to enter the country from Mexico. ""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" Hunter said, adding a moment later: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""

Border Patrol agents ""caught them,"" Hunter also said, but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""

Our eyebrows were raised. We sought detail.

No federal or state confirmation

No state or federal law enforcement agency confirmed Hunter’s account when we inquired, and Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper declined to reveal the congressman’s sources.

Fox News, in its original Oct. 8, 2014, online news report on Hunter’s declaration, quoted the Department of Homeland Security disputing his account.

Homeland Security told PolitiFact Texas that no such apprehensions have occurred. An agency spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, emailed: ""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

And after Hunter spoke, the Texas Department of Public Safety wrote state legislators, saying in an Oct. 8, 2014, email it ""does not have any information to confirm"" statements about Islamic terrorists or ISIS fighters entering the country. A DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, confirmed the message’s authenticity.

In the message, a DPS deputy director, Robert Bodisch, mentioned the Hunter interview and an Oct. 8, 2014, news report by Judicial Watch, a conservative news website, stating Islamic terrorists had entered the country from Mexico. According to unidentified Homeland Security sources, Judicial Watch said four terrorists had been apprehended in the previous 36 hours by federal authorities and the DPS in McAllen and Pharr.

In the message to legislators, Bodisch further wrote: ""An unsecure border is certainly a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminals of all kinds, and it would be naïve to rule out the possibility that any criminal organization would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our international border. That said, DPS does not have any information to confirm the specific statements recently reported in the press.""

On Sept. 17, 2014, PolitiFact in Washington analyzed an August 2014 Judicial Watch story, finding Mostly False another congressman’s claim that ""we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez,"" which neighbors El Paso. Research did not turn up any law enforcement official or news outlet that independently verified or corroborated the claim, making the declaration that ""we know"" with certainty ISIS is in Juarez a big stretch.

For this fact check, a terrorism expert said Hunter’s claim doesn’t make much sense.

""It’s implausible given the way the criminal-justice system works to have 10 ISIS fighters arrested at the border and never charged,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, director of the Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington.

Gartenstein-Ross said by phone he knows of ""no reporting coming through DHS suggesting that a large number of ISIS fighters have been intercepted at the border. I’ve talked to a large number of people within the department, and the department has unequivocally denied it. There’s not one shred of evidence this is the case.""

Kasper, informed we'd not confirmed Hunter's statement, said Hunter stands by what he said.

Kasper also expressed doubt federal agencies are revealing the facts about fighters getting caught.

""Problem here is that this is always a zero-sum game,"" Kasper wrote. ""We make the point. Official channels deny. Then, maybe in a few years from now the information will pop up on the front page of the Washington Post,""  much like that newspaper this week reported new details about the Secret Service prostitution scandal, Kasper said.

Our ruling

Hunter said ""at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas"" and there are ""dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""

No government agency confirms anything remotely close to the idea that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border. Notably, too, the lead Texas agency entrusted with public safety alerted legislators of its own lack of confirmation. Similarly, the idea there are ""dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol"" is missing a factual basis.

All told, this statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

158,'Hairgate': iPhone 6 users encounter latest Apple problem after 'bendgate',"(CNN) -- The mystery surrounding North Korea's erratic young leader, Kim Jong Un, only deepens by the day.

He has not been seen publicly in more than a month.  Rumors are flying that Kim is ill with gout, diabetes, even possible problems with his ankles. Now, a group of defectors say they believe Kim's younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, may be running the country while he recuperates.

The North Korea Intellectuals' Solidarity, a think-tank run by defectors, says Kim Yo Jong may be at least temporarily leading the government. The group has not revealed the source of its information, and CNN cannot independently confirm it. But Kim Yo Jong's star appears to be rising.

Why has North Korea decided to talk now?

Michael Madden, who runs the blog North Korea Leadership Watch, says Kim Yo Jong has been identified in North Korean media as deputy director of the Workers' Party, a very powerful position.

Victor Cha, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously handled the North Korea account with the National Security Council, says Kim Yo Jong began surfacing publicly earlier this year at party functions.

""Clearly it's an effort to slow-track her into becoming somebody who is important within the system,"" Cha says. ""I can see how it's possible that she's in some sort of temporary position. It's very difficult for the North Korean system to run without one of the Kim family at least titularly in charge. So, if Kim Jong Un is indisposed, she's really the only available body that's left, in terms of a direct Kim family line.""

Is Kim Jong Un still in charge of North Korea?

Who is Kim Yo Jong?

Madden says Kim Yo Jong was born in 1987 or 1988, and attended private school in Switzerland with Kim Jong Un. They both stayed at the North Korean embassy while attending the Swiss school, Madden says, and lived there under assumed names.

Madden says Kim Yo Jong is the youngest of seven siblings their father, Kim Jong Il, had with four women. Many of them are half-siblings, but Kim Jong Un and Kim Yo Jong have the same mother.

Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge

Madden says Kim Yo Jong was always close to her father, and after returning from Switzerland, she was appointed to positions of responsibility in the government. She would act as an advance-team leader, inspecting sites before official visits, and had administrative duties as well.

Now, he says, she continues those duties and has taken on more responsibility under her brother's rule: dealing with policy and receiving intelligence briefings. She acts ""almost like a White House chief-of-staff would,"" Madden says.

He says he believes she had a large role in planning the recent trip by three top North Korean officials to South Korea while her brother was absent from the scene.

Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge

Ready for prime time?

Given her age and that so little is known about Kim Yo Jong, North Korea-watchers are concerned about her being in the top leadership spot, if only temporarily. The stress and palace intrigue inside the North Korean regime, they say, may be overwhelming.

""If in fact she is running the country -- as someone in their early to mid twenties, to me that is quite alarming,"" Cha says. ""It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.""

All eyes will be on a significant event this Friday, October 10. That's the 69th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party. Kim Jong Un attended the anniversary event last year. If he doesn't show up at Friday's ceremonies, concern over his public disappearance will only grow.

If he does attend, intelligence analysts will be looking at his appearance, his body language -- every detail -- very carefully.

160,Judicial Watch's Farrell: ISIS Terrorists Did Cross Mexican Border,"The video was one of those viral sensations that tugs on your heartstrings and compels you to watch, because it defies your expectations and shows you just how kind and compassionate human beings can be. There was only one problem.

The video was a fake — at least according to a witness who says he was there while the YouTube hit, “How Does A Homeless Man Spend $100?” was filmed.

You have probably seen the video by now — if not, view it above. Posted by the prolific prankster Josh Paler Lin — whose other videos include “Sex In The Bathroom Prank” and “Rock Paper Scissors Hickey!” — the viral video purported to be a “social experiment” in which Paler Lin gave a homeless man identified as “Thomas” a hundred bucks in cash, then “secretly” filmed him as he spent the money.

The video was picked up by dozens of media outlets, including the Inquisitr, and in the week the clip has been on YouTube, has racked up more than 28 million views.

Why? Because Thomas spent his money not on booze or drugs, but on food. And not just for himself. He used the cash to purchase and distribute food to his fellow homeless people in Orange County, California.

While determining how much revenue any particular YouTube video creates is difficult, by many estimates a video can earn between $1,000 and $5,000 for each million views it accumulates.

That means Paler Lin may have grossed anywhere from $28,000 to $140,000 off this single video — in one week.

Perhaps more important, Paler Lin created a crowdfunding campaign along with the video, to raise more money for Thomas. That campaign has so far brought in about $130,000 in donations from people moved by the selfless acts Thomas performs in the video.

But in an interview posted on the site Vocativ on Tuesday, Taugan Tan Kadalim, who says he stumbled by chance across Paler Lin filming the video and witnessed the whole thing, calls the entire scenario “bull****.”

Kadalim, 26, says that he was there at Euclid Liquor & Market where he had just purchased a lottery ticket before walking across the street to his girlfriend’s apartment, and that what he saw made it clear that “Thomas knew he was being followed.”

Kadalim says he is a fan of Paler Lin and recognized the YouTube celebrity immediately.

He then watched as Paler Lin entered the liquor store and spoke with a clerk as Thomas waited outside. Only after Paler Lin returned, Kadalim told Vocativ, did Thomas enter the liquor store.

“He drove Thomas to the liquor store,” Kadalim told the site. “While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.”

Vocativ said its reporters corroborated the story with Kadalim’s girlfriend and brother, but calls to the liquor store went unreturned. Kadalim posted a comment to the video’s YouTube page the day the video went on line, saying quote clearly that Paler Lin drove Thomas to the store, but the comment went largely ignored.

Paler Lin, however, adamantly denied faking any part of the “homeless” viral video, telling Vocativ, “There is no way we’re making any of this up. This is real.”",unrelated
161,Amazon.com to open first physical store in Manhattan: DJ,"The North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has not been seen in public for more than a month, leading to rumors his sister has taken over while the Supreme Leader fights an illness or sits under house arrest.

Where is Kim Jong Un?

The saber-rattling North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month, spurring rumors he is ill and leading to speculation over who — if anyone — has filled the power vacuum in Pyongyang.

But there's one atom bomb of a theory being mentioned by Korea watchers that's quickly gaining currency.

Analysts believe 27-year-old Kim Yo Jong, the seventh and youngest of Kim Jong Il's children with four women, has risen rapidly within the regime and may be secretly running the Hermit Kingdom — for now.

Little Kim reportedly went to the same Swiss boarding school with Kim Jong Un and has held positions within the North Korean government since her father was in power.

""If in fact she is running the country — as someone in their early- to mid-20s — to me that is quite alarming,"" Center for Strategic and International Studies analyst Victor Cha told CNN. ""It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.""

State TV showed Kim Jong Un uncharacteristically walking with a noticeable limp in July at the 20th anniversary memorial commemorating the death of his grandfather, the nation's founder.

After the Supreme Leader's recent vanishing act, health theories have abounded. Kim is ill with everything from gout and a cheese addiction to ankle problems and diabetes. State media called what ails Kim ""discomfort"" in a Sept. 26 report.

He may even be under house arrest, according to Remco Breuker, professor of Korean studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

""We're not sure where he is, or what's happening,"" Breuker told the ABC News. ""We don't know whether he's in the hospital or whether he's been put under house arrest.""

Kim Jong Un, whose pal Dennis Rodman said is 31, saw his waistline balloon since he ascended to power in late 2011, analysts note.

Sis Kim Yo Jong is a senior official in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. But her role might have expanded dramatically if Kim Jong Un is incapacitated.

""She is one of the only people in (North Korea) that we know has unfettered direct access to KJU. At the present time I would not be surprised if she is sole gatekeeper,"" North Korea Leadership Watch blog's Michael Madden told NBC News.

Korea watchers point to Friday's anniversary of the founding of the Ruling Workers Party. If Kim Jong Un doesn't show, expect speculation to reach fever pitch.

162,Lynch Mob Castrates Alleged Rapist In Rajasthan,"Newly released audio allegedly records the moment that Officer Darren Wilson opened fire on unarmed Michael Brown

At least ten shots can be heard - in two separate volleys of gunfire

Experts have said this indicated a 'moment of contemplation' for Wilson

Is another tantalizing piece of evidence collected in the ongoing case

Officer Wilson claims he felt his life was threatened on August 9

Witnesses and a friend of Brown, 18, claim he had surrendered

Brown was buried on Monday in a ceremony attended by thousands

The FBI has been handed a potentially crucial recording that allegedly contains audio of the moment that Officer Darren Wilson opened fire and killed unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.

Revealed by CNN's Don Lemon on Monday, at least ten shots are heard to ring out during the background of the recording, with a brief but significant pause between the first seven shots and the last volley of four.

The unidentified man who has given the unverified tape to authorities claims to have coincidentally recorded the fatal shots that killed Brown in broad daylight on August 9, and experts who have listened to the audio have said it could prove damning for Officer Wilson.

Scroll Down for Audio

Attorney: Lopa Blumenthal is legally representing the man who claims to have coincidentally recorded the shooting of Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9

'There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern,' said retired Chief Deputy US Marshall Matthew Fog after listening on CNN.

'It is very significant, because if you have a pause there it means somebody had time to think and then fire again.'

In the audio, the unidentified man is heard telling someone, 'You’re so pretty' then 11 gunshots can be heard to cackle in the background — seven in one volley, followed a pause and then a final burst of four.

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.

'He was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat,' said Blumenthal.

'He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.'

Lemon cautioned that 'CNN cannot independent verify the authenticity of this tape' but did say that the FBI have interviewed both Blumenthal and her client.

'We had been told that at least six shots were fired at Michael Brown. In the tape that you have, which is alleged to be of the shooting—we can't independently authorize it, as CNN, because we did not shoot it, but there were more than six shots,' Lemon said.

Funeral: The casket containing the remains of Michael Brown awaiting the start of his funeral inside the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church, St Louis, Missouri, USA, on 25 August 2014

Grief: Dorian Johnson, who is one of the key witnesses in the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, leaves Brown's funeral at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, on Monday, 25, August

If indeed the audio is genuine it calls into question the version of events that Officer Wilson and the Ferguson police force have claimed occurred on that Saturday afternoon.

At least two autopsies performed on Michael Brown have concluded he died after being shot six times by Wilson after being pulled over by the officer, including a fatal 'kill shot' to the top of his head.

Numerous witnesses, including Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, claim that Wilson opened fire after bungling opening his squad car door, causing the teen to run before turning back to face the officer with his hands raised saying 'don't shoot'.

Johnson then alleges that Wilson continued to fire.

Ferguson police and friends of Officer Wilson contend that Brown engaged in a scuffle with Wilson when the officer pulled him and Johnson over, tried to grab his weapon and then run towards him, leaving him no choice but to fire.

Indeed in recent days reports had emerged stating that Wilson, 28, was badly beaten and left with serious facial injuries following the fatal shooting in the St Louis suburb, including an eye socket fracture.

On Tuesday, The Gateway Pundit reported that the officer had suffered an 'orbital blowout fracture'.

But CNN reported on Thursday that although the officer was taken to a hospital with a badly swollen face following the shooting on August 9, x-rays came back negative for any serious injury.

Earlier reports had claimed that the officer was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows, according to the source.

A police source told Fox: 'The Assistant (Police) Chief took him to the hospital, his face all swollen on one side. He was beaten very severely.'

Demonstrators protest the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, last Thursday night

The source continued: 'They ignored him [Wilson] and the officer started to get out of the car to tell them to move. They shoved him right back in, that’s when Michael Brown leans in and starts beating Officer Wilson in the head and the face.'

A police source has confirmed to MailOnline that Wilson was taken to hospital and treated for facial injuries sustained during the Brown incident but would not elaborate on the severity or nature of those injuries.

Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries.

Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record, has not been arrested or charged with any crime.

He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and is under 24-hour guard after death threats were aimed at him.

Wilson is 'traumatized, scared for his life and his family' along with being deeply concerned that a grand jury, which met for the first time on Wednesday, will make an example out of him, the source told Fox.

Earlier reports had claimed that Officer Wilson was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has come under fire after calling for the 'vigorous prosecution' of Wilson despite the fact that the officer has not yet been charged with any crime.

His deputy, Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder said: 'It's really heartbreaking to see a man elected to an office that high in our state government... come out with a statement like that, that does prejudge the case.'

St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said on Wednesday he estimated it would be the middle of October before the grand jury reached a decision on whether Officer Wilson will face charges over Michael Brown's death.

Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday ordered the Missouri National Guard to begin withdrawing from Ferguson.

Since the guard's arrival Monday, flare-ups in the small section of town that had been the center of nightly unrest have begun to subside.

About 100 people gathered Thursday evening, walking in laps near the spot where Michael Brown was shot. Some were in organized groups, such as clergy members.

We're told that Conde has sent a memo to their staff in the building telling them that ""they cannot eat at their desks"" and that a complaint to the city's health department is next on the agenda.

When we bumped into Carter outside the tower, where the publishing house set up shop in November, we asked him if the little beasts are disgusting as we've heard. ""They're rats!"" laughed the legendary editor, ""What do you think?""

Doctors removed a matchhead-sized insect, believed to be a spider, from under Dylan Thomas’s skin earlier this week and have sent the creature away for testing to determine what it is.

It had been there for three days and burrowed up to his chest, leaving a trail of red blisters.

The 21-year-old was on his first trip to Bali.

He told News Corp yesterday that doctors had pulled a tropical spider “a bit bigger than the size of a match head” from his skin.

There’s just one problem.

Spiders, according to Perth arachnid expert Dr Volker Framenau, don’t burrow in skin.

“They don’t have the tools, the armature, to do this sort of stuff,” Dr Framenau said.

“I find it highly unlikely, almost impossible, that it was a spider.’

More likely, Dr Framenau said, was some kind of burrowing mite.

“That’s a professional skin-digger,” he said.

“There’s a lot of nasty stuff out there.”

The results of the tests on the creature should come back next week.

171,Sergeant-at-Arms stopped shooter on Parliament Hill,"It is one of the most annoying aspects of modern air travel - kicking off shoes and removing belts to get through security without setting off the scanner.

One frustrated traveller clearly decided the only answer was to strip off altogether, much to the surprise of security guards.

The incident at Pulkovo Airport, in St Petersburg, Russia, saw the man strip his clothes off in a nonchalant manner before strolling through the metal detector watch by bemused airport workers.

Two guards can be seen chatting and looking on as the man bends down to remove his shoes and then starts to remove his belt.

Suddenly the man, who some sources believe may be an IT department worker at the airport, takes off his trousers altogether an places them in the tray with the rest of his belongings.

One security worker can be seen nudging his colleague and pointing to the man, but neither appears to know what to do next.

At first all seems as normal as the man bends down to remove his shoes - a common request by security when passing through metal detectors at airports

Suddenly the man surprises staff by removing his trousers altogether and placing them in a tray

As startled workers look on, seemingly unsure what to do, the man continues stripping off

Unbothered by the attention, the man moves onto his top half and whips off his jumper, leaving him completely naked.

But he still takes a moment to remove the all-important wrist watch - the one thing that actually could set off the scanner - before strutting through the metal detecting arch.

Staff stand back and appear to let him just walk through the metal detectors. The cheeky man even jokingly hesitate by the workers as if to check they don't want to search him further.

Completely unbothered by the attention, the man then strolls through the security gate, even pausing by security staff as if to ask if he needs to be searched further

The first thing the man puts back on is his wrist watch as he gathers his clothing up at the end of the conveyor belt

Then, as if there is nothing unusual about the situation, the man picks up his clothes - places his wrist watch back on first, then proceeds to walk off.

St Petersburg police are said to be investigating the incident.

Passengers at airports around the world have long complained of 'invasive' searches at security points, with American passengers in particular complaining about the methods of the Transport Security Administration (TSA).

And instead of hurriedly getting changed, the man simply bundles up his clothes and walks off

It seems this gentleman isn't the first to stage a naked protest either.

A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.

Hurricane Floyd aftermath
According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. “I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside,” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick.”

Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106°. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.

The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of  Ebola on US soil.


 
Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the world’s bio waste.”


Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. “It is a safe and sound process,” Osborne said. “I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.”

A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment",unrelated

The Washington Post and TIME magazine both posted the video, apparently believing it.

It later updated the post, saying that “The Independent reveals this video to have been falsely doctored to show a bird defecating on Putin.”

The Associated Press update:

Obama, Putin discuss Ukraine, missile treaty

WASHINGTON (AP) — Capping a week of aggressive action against Russia, President Barack Obama pressed Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday for a diplomatic path out of Ukraine’s struggle with Moscow-backed pro-Russian separatists. Putin countered by calling U.S. and European economic sanctions against Russia counterproductive.

Obama later conceded that pressure from recently imposed U.S. and European measures to squeeze the Russian economy “hasn’t resolved the problem yet.”

In an Obama-initiated phone call Friday, the U.S. president also raised concerns that Russia violated a key Cold War era nuclear weapons treaty, the White House said. In a letter this week from Obama to Putin and in an administration report released this week, the United States said Russia violated a 1987 treaty that bans all U.S. and Russian missiles of intermediate range, meaning those that can travel between about 300 miles and about 3,400 miles.

Putin in the call said the sanctions seriously damage bilateral cooperation and general global stability, according to a Kremlin report on the call.

It was the first conversation between the leaders since the U.S. and Europe slapped the new round of economic sanctions on Russia and since Obama’s letter claiming a breach in the missile treaty.

“I indicated to him, just as we will do what we say we do in terms of sanctions, we’ll also do what we say in terms of wanting to resolve this issue diplomatically if he takes a different position,” Obama told reporters later.

The Kremlin said both Obama and Putin underscored the urgency for bringing an end to fighting in eastern Ukraine and spoke positively about a meeting that took place the day before in Minsk, Belarus, among members of a diplomatic “contact group” pursuing an end to hostilities. That group includes representatives from Russia, Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.",unrelated

176,Media outlets identify 'Jihadi John',"A Guantanamo Bay prisoner released last year as part of an exchange for captured US serviceman Bowe Bergdahl has resumed contact with the Taliban, according to reports.

The former detainee - one of five men released in a controversial deal which saw the return of the US PoW from Afghanistan - is said to have been in touch with members of the al-Qaeda linked Haqqani network.

This is the first suggestion that any of the detainees involved in the swap may be trying to engage again in militant activity.

The five, who mostly held mid- to high-level positions within the Taliban before their capture during the early days of the US-led war in Afghanistan, were detained because of their association with the terror group.

Since their release they have been living in Qatar, which promised to monitor the men on behalf of the US.

The Pentagon said Thursday that it is working with Qatar and is confident that any threat posed by the former detainees can be mitigated.

US Sen Lindsey Graham, who recently visited Qatar, said he had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country, but said he was assured during his visit that all five remain in the small Gulf nation.

Qatar gained public praise from President Barack Obama for brokering the controversial deal in May 2014 that freed Army Sgt. Bergdahl from Taliban captivity in exchange for the release of the five senior Taliban officials who had been imprisoned for years at the US-run Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.

Qatar promised Mr Obama it would keep the five under watch for one year, although they would then be free to leave.

""It's just a year deal,"" Mr Graham told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ""Just as sure as we're sitting here, they're going back to the fight.""

""They've had some Haqqani people come to meet with them. ... They're reaching out. The Taliban five are communicating with people inside Afghanistan.""

However, Mr Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a leading Capitol Hill voice on foreign policy, said all five are still in Qatar.

""I was afraid one had left, but they told me they're all still there,"" he said.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it would not comment on specific cases involving the detainees.

""However, we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously, and we work in close coordination through military, intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary,"" the statement said. ""The Defense Department has a close security partnership with the government of Qatar. We're confident in our ability to continue to mitigate any threat that may be posed by the former Guantanamo detainees.""

Haqqani operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and has been one of the deadliest threats to US troops in the war. The network, which the State Department designated as a foreign terrorist organisation in 2012, claims allegiance to the Afghan Taliban, yet operates with some degree of autonomy.",unrelated
177,J.J. Abrams Asks Disney To Move Up 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Release Date,"A Catholic priest from Massachusetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.
Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.

“I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric. “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however, if they will allow Father O’neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.

Last week a 24-year-old Muslim convert admitted taking her infant son to live among Islamic State terrorists in the Syrian city of Raqqa because she believes he will lead a 'better life' under their brutal regime.

Asiya Ummi Abdullah denied that children are unhappy living under the oppressive rule of ISIS' religious fanatics and explained that she felt her three-year-old son's spiritual well-being was better served in the group's de facto capital, where public crucifixions and beheadings are commonplace.

Ummi Abduallah - who had lived in Turkey since her teens but was born in Kyrgyzstan - said moving to the militant stronghold in Syria was in part to shield the young boy from the sex, crime, drugs and alcohol she sees as rampant in her home town Istanbul.

'Who says children here are unhappy?... He will know God and live under his rules,' she said.

The clip, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, shows resistance forces from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) firing assault rifles and machine guns mounted on the back of a car at militants hiding behind buildings in the Kobane suburbs.

The terrorists launched a renewed assault on Kobane last night, killing dozens of Kurds who have resisted ISIS' advances into the city's suburbs over the last three weeks.

Islamic State militants are now in control of one third of the besieged Syrian city of Kobane despite three days of American airstrikes, a group monitoring violence in the country said today.

This morning the chilling sight of the group's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes.

While the airstrikes appear to have slowed the militants advance in some areas of the city, ISIS fighters appear to be creeping ever closer to the centre of Kobane, where thousands of civilians unable or unwilling to flee their homes face rape and massacre.

News of ISIS' gains came as the Pentagon admitted airstrikes alone will not be enough to prevent the fall of Kobane, raising serious questions over the U.S.'s wider campaign against the terror group.

As the #RIPFidel hashtag began to spread online, it became clear that rumors of Castro's death were being fueled by the high-profile death of a different man with the same name, half a world away.

Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of prominent Kenyan politician and former prime minister Raila Odinga, reportedly died on Jan. 4. His Cuban namesake, however, still appears to be very much alive.

Reports of Fidel Castro's death have been a staple of the international rumor mill for years, with speculation on the former Cuban leader's status bubbling up every few months.

There is no indication that the 88-year-old Castro is on his deathbed. However, he last appeared in public on Jan. 8, 2014 at an art exhibition in Havana, ending nine months out of public view.

The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Aug. 21, 2014. He was also photographed with the Chinese and Russian presidents in July. Castro was last heard from on Oct. 18, when he published an editorial about Ebola.

In 2006, a serious illness forced him to step down from duties as president, and hand over leadership to his younger brother Raul Castro.

Some of the speculation was prompted by Castro's failure to comment after the U.S. and Cuba declared on Dec. 17 that they would move to restore full diplomatic relations broken a half century ago.

On Friday, Cuba-related Twitter accounts were ablaze with speculation, fueled in large part by reports on news websites, such as Diario de Cuba and Diario las America, that Cuba had scheduled a news conference, possibly to discuss Castro's health.

One CNN journalist added fuel to the fire, tweeting that a speech from Raul was imminent, although he later retracted the information, citing ""bad info from Reuters.""

181,Christian Bale Won't Play Steve Jobs After All,"Robots are increasingly replacing humans in a variety of mundane tasks, like bolting a car together or making lollipops, but now they are moving into the security business.

Microsoft recently installed a fleet of 5-feet-tall, 300-pound robots to protect its Silicon Valley campus. The robots are packed with HD security cameras and sensors to take in their organic, protein-based surroundings. There’s also an artificial intelligence on board that can sound alarms when the robot notices something awry. It can also read license plates and cross-reference them to see if they’re stolen.

The K5 robots come from a California company called Knightscope, which calls the robots “autonomous data machines” that provide a “commanding but friendly presence.” Sounds like something a robot manufacturer would say.

Let’s be honest though, the robots look pretty damn cool. They’re like modern versions of R2-D2.

Thankfully—or sadly, depending on how you look at it—the K5 robots don’t have any weapons on them. All they can do is assess a situation, sound an alarm to defuse it, or call a human security officer to the scene. There are, however, plans equip the robots with tasers sometime in the future.

Microsoft’s new protectors are fairly autonomous. A single charge will last 24 hours, and if the robot notices that its battery is getting low, it will return to a charging port and plug itself in. It can fully recharge in 20 minutes, which is pretty insane.

There are plans to one day expand the use of Knightscope’s robots and have them patrol the streets as part of human police units. We can’t even imagine what would happen if Elon Musk heard about this.

Mum Meng Xiangyan faced a real-life Sophie's Choice when poverty forced her to decide between her twins.

The distraught 29-year-old said that she and her husband loved both of their children.

But with certain death awaiting their daughter unless they could get medical treatment, they were prepared to sell their son to a good home so that both would have a chance of life.

Pictures published in local media show her standing on Weihai Road in Qingdao, which is a major city in eastern Shandong Province, Eastern China, with a placard offering to sell him to the highest bidder.

He was eating what appeared to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appealed for someone to come forward and buy the boy.

She said: ""Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

""But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukaemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives. It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.""

Medics say that the child is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital.

The family have sold up their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10 square metre flat close to where the therapies are being carried out. The parents are also struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal.

So far, there have been no offers on their son, who has not been named.

Their desperation follows on from a similar recent story in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband, Zhou Xinggui, are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter.

His wife's sign read: ""Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to sell my daughter and save my husband.""

In the four hours she sat with the sign, no-one bought her daughter.",unrelated
183,KIM DINE WITH ME: Porky president Kim Jong-un to open UK restaurant serving DOG,"Central Bedfordshire Council has refuted newspaper reports which suggested it was about to issue an Anti-Social Behaviour Order (Asbo) to a six-foot mechanical bear.

The polar bear, named Bernard, is situated outside the Loft Cafe in Shefford and performs Christmas carols to passers-by but a story in the Bedfordshire on Sunday newspaper suggested residents feared it “could be hit with an Asbo after receiving complaints”.

However, a press officer for the council told i100.co.uk that the story was “embellished” and there had been “absolutely no mention of an Asbo or a gagging order, or anything like that”.

The council did acknowledge that one noise complaint had been made about the bear and council officers were therefore “legally obliged” to investigate it but subsequently deemed it not to be a nuisance.

We have received one complaint regards a Christmas carol-singing bear and have visited the premises on a number of occasions and, while Bernard has not been deemed a nuisance, we have written to both parties, explaining the situation as part of an ongoing investigation.

The council takes noise complaints seriously and has a legal obligation to fully investigate them, but we also want everyone in Central Bedfordshire to enjoy themselves over the Christmas period and would urge residents and business owners alike to be mindful of their neighbours and the local community when planning festivities.

Central Bedfordshire Council statement
The story in the Bedfordshire on Sunday, which was picked up by the Metro and the BBC, has subsequently been updated with a small disclaimer at the end saying: “Central Bedfordshire Council would like to make clear no ABSO proceedings have been brought against Bernard nor has he officially been ‘gagged’.”

Government guidelines say that anyone over the age of 10 can be given an Asbo for “drunken or threatening behaviour, vandalism and graffiti and playing loud music at night”. Sadly, it makes no mention of mechanical polar bears or any other inanimate objects for that matter.",unrelated

186,Mexico prosecutor: Students not in 1st mass graves,"Militants from Islamic State (Isis) claimed to have killed an American journalist long held captive in Syria in retaliation for ongoing US airstrikes against its forces in Iraq.

A propaganda video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man dressed in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Wright Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012.

The masked executioner spoke in English, with what sounded like a British accent, and said that the slaying came in response to the airstrikes ordered by President Barack Obama against Isis 12 days ago.

Isis, whose chief spokesman came under State Department sanctions on Monday, warned of further revenge – including on another man purported to be a captured US journalist, Steven Sotloff – and in the video, the victim was made to read a statement blaming the US for his own murder.

Foley has been missing in Syria since November 2012, where he went to report on the bloody struggle to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. He was initially thought to have been captured by forces loyal to the Assad regime.

A Facebook message from a support group, Free James Foley, urged patience “until we all have more information,” and asked that readers “keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

YouTube took down the gruesome video, but not before it sparked a debate on social media about the ethics of sharing it, adding a metatextual debate to a depiction of a man’s violent death.

Foley, 40, a former Stars and Stripes reporter, was captured in November 2012 near the Syrian town of Taftanaz. It was not his first detention while reporting: in 2011, he was taken while reporting on the uprising against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi’s forces ultimately released him after six weeks in captivity.

A friend of Foley’s and his fellow captive in Libya, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote in a 2013 essay that captivity was “the state most violently opposite his nature.” Gillis described Foley as gentle, friendly, courageous and impatient with “anything that slows his forward momentum.”

In a January 2013 interview with local television news near her Rochester, New Hampshire home, Foley’s mother Diane said her son was “passionate about covering the story in Syria, passionate about the people there.”

Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said US intelligence was working to determine the authenticity of the video.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said in a statement.

Messages left with the Foley family were not returned.

A day after Obama declared that Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US warplanes had broken Isis’ hold on the critical Mosul Dam, US Central Command announced two strikes near it on Monday, to “further expand control of the area.” One strike was said to have destroyed an Isis checkpoint while the other was “not successful.”

Obama has offered no timeframe for the length of his campaign against Isis. The US military has bombed over 90 targets attributed to Isis, including vehicle convoys, mobile artillery and fixed positions, since 8 August. Most of the strikes have come in the past few days, near the dam. The other strikes have occurred either to blunt an Isis advance on the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil or to lift an Isis siege on Mount Sinjar, where it chased thousands of Iraqi Yazidis whom it threatened to kill unless they converted to Islam.

According to a blog linked to Isis, several female fighters who fought alongside the Kurds have been taken prisoner, including Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian-born resident of Tel Aviv. Israel Radio reported Kurdish sources denying the claims, saying Rosenberg was not in the area when it was attacked.

A Canadian government spokesman said in a statement his country was “pursuing all appropriate channels” as it sought further information and was in touch with local authorities.

Asked by an Israeli television station about the reports, the Israeli defence minister, Moshe Ya’alon, said: “I cannot confirm that and I hope that it isn’t true.” The Shin Bet, Israel’s general security service, told the Jerusalem Post: “There are no further details at this stage”.

Rosenberg, 31, joined Kurdish troops fighting Isis earlier this month. A former pilot who served in the Israeli Defence Force (IDF), she reportedly contacted Kurdish fighters over the internet before travelling through Iraq to train at one of their camps on the Syrian border.

In an interview with Israel Radio aired in November, Rosenberg said she was training with Kurdish guerrillas with the intention of fighting in Syria. “They are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really,” she said.

On 20 November, a message posted to a Facebook page in Rosenberg’s name said: “My Facebook account and friend requests are being managed by someone else until I have access again in apx [sic] 2 weeks time on or around week of [8 December]. Please do not message as this is not me. Thank you.”

Messages of concern were being posted on the Facebook page this weekend.

190,Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's 'wife and son detained in Lebanon',"The right-hand man of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was killed by an airstrike in Mosul.
An airstrike in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul killed at least two members of the group, including an aide to ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, according to the Iraqi Defense Ministry.
Reports that Baghdadi himself had been killed by a U.S. airstrike circulated in Turkish and Kurdish media Wednesday and were repeated to The Daily Beast by multiple Iraqi sources. But a Pentagon official denied that the ISIS leader was dead. ""There is no validity to the rumor that we've killed Baghdadi,"" a senior defense official told The Daily Beast.  

The Iraqi Defense Ministry announcement, first reported by al Arabayia, did not specify whether the airstrike was carried out by American or Iraqi forces, but NBC News reports that a senior security official confirmed it was a U.S. airstrike. The article does not clarify whether the security official is American or Iraqi but quotes them as saying that three ISIS leaders were killed, including Baghdadi’s aide Abu Hajar Al-Sufi, an explosives specialist and commander in the town of Tal Afar.

There have been no public statements yet from U.S. officials on the reported airstrikes.

While the U.S. air war in Iraq has been steadily expanding since it began in early August, Thursday’s reports provide the first public indication that ISIS’s senior leadership is being directly targeted.

The rumors of Baghdadi’s death that spread through northern Iraq yesterday may have been triggered by uncertainty over who died in the airstrikes that reportedly killed his aide. It’s also possible that claim’s of Baghdadi’s death could have come from ISIS itself as part of a deception campaign to cover the leader’s tracks and obscure his true status and whereabouts.

Multiple sources, including Kurdish intelligence officials and former Iraqi army officers, told The Daily Beast Wednesday that Baghdadi had died somewhere in Syria after being wounded in a recent airstrike and fleeing Iraq to seek medical treatment.

This was not the first time that rumors of Baghdadi’s death have surfaced. Without an independent press to verify new information, unverified claims can be spread quickly through Iraq as speculation outpacing facts and gets taken for the truth.

But the new reports that ISIS leaders were killed by airstrikes in Mosul, coming only a day after a flurry of claims about Baghdadi’s death in Syria, suggests the group’s leadership is increasingly vulnerable and that Baghdadi may be on the run and seeking sanctuary in Syria where President Obama has not yet authorized military intervention.

192,Rumor Robert Plant Ripped Up $800 Million Contract To Reunite Led Zeppelin Called 'Rubbish',"There have been lots of “Comcast delivers bad customer service” stories lately — so overwhelming, in fact, that the company just appointed an executive to solve the problem amid worries that disgruntled customers could derail the company’s merger with Time Warner — but the latest story may be the worst: A Comcast customer says the company got him fired from the job.


Consumerist reports that the customer — known in the story only as ""Conal"" — began subscribing to Comcast in 2013 under a promotional offer, but almost immediately found himself charged for set-top boxes that had not been activated. He says he met with a Comcast rep in May of that year to sort out the billing issues, but they actually got worse from there.

He attempted to cancel, but was persuaded to stay for three free months of The Movie Channel; the company ended up sending him items he hadn't order and charged him more than $1,800 for them. Conal, an accountant, then contacted Comcast's controller. Consumerist reports: ""During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcast’s billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation.""

Here's where the problem develops: Comcast learned where Conal was employed. It just happened to be a company that does business with Comcast.

Consumerist reports that Conal claims he never named the company when he was on the phone with various customer service reps — he believes Comcast must've looked up the information somehow. Nonetheless:

At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal’s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he’d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.

When he was fired, Conal’s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.

Emphasis added.

Consumerist, never a Comcast-friendly publication to begin with, seethes:

""I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller’s office,"" writer Chris Moran says. ""Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened.  And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldn’t have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service he’d paid for.""

Comcast told Consumerist it ""will review (Conal's) lawyer’s letter and respond as quickly as possible.”",unrelated

194,More than 200 kidnapped Nigerian girls to be released after deal reached with Boko Haram,"More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in April, sparking the #BringBackOurGirls campaign

A top military official in Nigeria was reported Friday to have announced a cease-fire between the government and the military group Boko Haram, igniting both skepticism and hopes that more than 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped in April would be released.

The truce was said to be announced by Air Marshall Alex Badeh, Nigeria’s chief of defense, the Associated Press reports. The release of the girls is still being negotiated, Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade added, but the cease-fire would begin immediately and could take take several days to reach the groups of militants.

“Already, the terrorists have announced a cease-fire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a cease-fire,” said Mike Omeri, a government spokesman on Boko Haram, at a news conference. The AP adds that Omeri confirmed negotiations about the girls’ potential release were held throughout the week.

Reports of the deal were met with hesitation by those who have followed the saga since the girls were abducted from their school in Chibok on April 14. There was neither an official statement quickly released by the government, nor an announcement made by the insurgent group, the New York Times reports.

Boko Haram, which released a video in May that claimed responsibility for the girls’ abductions and vowed to “sell them on the market, by Allah,” has previously demanded the release of rebel prisoners in exchange for their freedom. But Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who has faced intense global pressure to free the students, said that’s a trade he will not make. The Nigerian government has in the past misled the public about the girls’ status; its fight against Boko Haram has been fraught with challenges since the militant group rose up in 2009, from inefficiency and corruption in the military to lax local support in the northern communities that are threatened most.

In August, the Wall Street Journal reported that American surveillance planes spotted groups that appeared to be the missing girls, suggesting that not all of them had been sold into marriage or slavery — as feared — and that some were perhaps being kept as a bargaining tactic.",discuss
195,Islamic State Militants Claim to Have Beheaded US Journalist James Wright Foley,"MOGADISHU, Somalia — Al-Shabaab’s top leader was traveling in one of two vehicles hit Monday night in a US military strike, a member of the Somali Islamic extremist group said Tuesday.

The spokesman would not say whether al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane was among the six militants killed.

The two vehicles were heading toward the coastal town of Barawe, al-Shabaab’s main base, when they were hit, Abu Mohammed told the Associated Press. A witness in Somalia described ground-shaking explosions in the strike.

Al-Shabaab attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people, a year ago this month, and the US targeted planners of the bloody assault. US commanders were waiting to determine the attack’s outcome.

“US military forces conducted an operation in Somalia today against the al-Shabaab network. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate,” said Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby.

After the US strike in a forest south of Mogadishu, masked Islamic militants in the area arrested dozens of residents they suspected of spying for the US and searched nearby homes, a resident said.

“Mass arrests just started, everyone is being detained,” said Mohamed Ali, who lives in the Sablale district. “They even searched nearby jungles and stopped the nomads transporting milk and grass to the towns for questioning.”

A senior Somali intelligence official said a US drone targeted Godane as he left a meeting of the group’s top leaders. Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is the group’s spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al Qaeda. In 2012, the US offered a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his arrest.

The Somali official, speaking on condition of anonymity since he was not authorized to speak to the media, said intelligence indicated Godane “might have been killed along with other militants.” The official said the attack took place 105 miles (170 kilometers) south of Mogadishu, where al-Shabaab trains its fighters.

As government and African Union forces were heading to a town in the district, they heard what sounded like an “earthquake” as the al-Shabaab bases were hit, the governor of Somalia’s Lower Shabelle region, Abdiqadir Mohamed Nor, told the Associated Press.

“There was an airstrike near Sablale. We saw something,” Nor said.

The US has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia in recent years.

A US missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabaab, and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a US strike that killed al-Shabaab’s top explosives expert.

The latest US action comes after Somalia’s government forces regained control of a high-security prison in the capital that was attacked Sunday. Seven heavily armed suspected al-Shabaab members had attempted to free other extremists held there.

Somali officials said all seven attackers, three government soldiers and two civilians were killed. Mogadishu’s Godka Jilacow prison is an interrogation center for Somalia’s intelligence agency, and many suspected militants are believed to be held in underground cells there. The attack started when a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison and the gunmen then fought their way into the prison.

Al-Shabaab had attacked the mall in Nairobi last year in retaliation against Kenya for sending troops into Somalia against the extremists. Godane said at the time that the attack was carried out in retaliation for the West’s support for Kenya’s Somalia intervention and the “interest of their oil companies.”

Al-Shabaab is now mostly active in Somalia’s rural regions after being ousted from the capital by African Union forces in 2011.

Somali military officials last week launched a military operation to oust al-Shabaab from its last remaining bases in the southern parts of Somalia. On Saturday the militants withdrew from the town of Bulomarer, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Mogadishu, after hours of fighting.",unrelated
196,Islamic State killer 'Jihadi John' named as Mohammed Emwazi,"BEIRUT: A statement attributed to the Islamic State group claimed an American female hostage was killed in a Jordanian airstrike on Friday on the outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, the extremist group's main stronghold.

The statement identified the woman as Kayla Jean Mueller and said she was killed during Muslim prayers - which usually take place around midday on Fridays - in airstrikes that targeted ""the same location for more than an hour.""

No Islamic State militants were killed in the airstrikes, the statement further claimed.

It published photos allegedly of the bombed site, showing a severely damaged brown colored three-story building - but no images of the woman.

American officials said they were looking into the report, and the White House said it did not have immediate comment. There was also no immediate comment from the Jordanian government.

The IS statement could not be independently verified. It appeared on a militant website commonly used by IS and was also distributed by IS-affiliated Twitter users.

Mueller, of Prescott, Arizona, had been working in Turkey assisting Syrian refugees, according to a 2013 article in The Daily Courier, her hometown newspaper. The 26-year-old told the paper that she was drawn to help with the situation in Syria.

""For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,"" she said. ""It's important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.""

According to the local paper, Mueller had been working with the humanitarian aid agency Support to Life, as well as a local NGO that helped female Syrian refugees develop skills.

A 2007 article about Mueller from the same local newspaper said she was a student at Northern Arizona University and was active in the Save Darfur Coalition.

On Sunday, President Barack Obama said the U.S. was ""deploying all the assets that we can"" to find Mueller.

""We are in very close contact with the family trying to keep them updated,"" he said in an interview with NBC's Today Show. ""Obviously this is something that is heart-breaking for the family and we want to make sure we do anything we can to make sure that any American citizen is rescued from this situation.""

Her identity had not been disclosed out of fears for her safety.

If her death is confirmed, she would be the fourth American to die while in the captivity of the Islamic State militants. Three other Americans, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig were beheaded by the group.

Jordan, which is part of a U.S.-led coalition bombing Islamic State group targets in Syria, stepped up its attacks after IS announced it had killed a captive Jordanian pilot. The Syrian government said Thursday that dozens of Jordanian fighter jets had bombed Islamic State training centers and weapons storage sites. It did not say where the attacks occurred.

200,Did NBC Nightly News Go Live To A Man Who Was Taking A Piss?,"A British man who went to fight against Islamic State in Iraq has said a mother was made to eat her own son after he was kidnapped and murdered by the group.

Yasir Abdulla claimed that an elderly Kurdish woman went to Mosul, a city captured by Isis, and demanded to see him.

But he said she was fed his body.

Mr Abdulla, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, told The Sun: ‘She was determined to find her son and went to Isis headquarters and asked to see him.

‘The Isis men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.’

She was then given meat, rice and soup.

He continued: ‘But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said “You’ve just eaten him”.’

Mr Abdulla decided to go to Iraq after discovering that Isis had come within six miles of his home village in Kurdistan.

He said that Isis was threatening to kidnap and bury people alive unless they surrendered.

He has now returned to Yorkshire, but hopes to return to fight the terror group.",unrelated
201,ESPN's Domestic Violence Panel Is Missing Something Important,"YouTube prankster Josh Paler Lin decided to give a man named Thomas the money and follow him to see how he spends it. His first stop was a local liquor store but instead of buying alcohol he purchased food that he gave away to others in need.

A homeless man was given a chance, and he touched an awful lot of surprised people.

A viral online video from YouTube prankster Josh Paler Lin tells the story of a homeless man named Thomas and his desire to not let his circumstances keep him from being selfless - by using his newfound money to help not himself, but others.

Josh made the video, which has received more than 11 million hits by Wednesday morning, with the idea to give a random homeless person $100 and secretly follow him to see how he spends it.

He meets an elderly man with gray hair, a mustache and dark jacket named Thomas holding up a sign along a highway. He tells Josh he's just trying to get enough to buy something to eat and Josh shocks him with the $100.

""Oh goodness. Oh no way,"" he says as Josh pulls five $20 bills from his wallet. ""Oh brother, are you sure? I'm starting to tear up over here. That's like incredible.""

Josh reassures him it's totally fine as they hug. Thomas says he never had something like this happen before in his life.

The next part of the video seemed to be expected by many viewers but Thomas surprised them all.

He packed up his stuff and began walking down the road to a liquor store. The video records him exit the store with several bags, but he didn't buy alcohol.

He purchased food that he then delivered to other needy people in a nearby park.

Josh appears to tell Thomas what was going on.

""I feel like I owe you an apology,"" Josh said as he reaches to grab Thomas' hand. ""You went to a liquor store earlier —""

""You thought I was going to get all smacked up drunk, huh?"" Thomas interrupts. ""But there's things money can't buy and I get a happiness out of what I'm doing.""

Ironically during Josh's confession a man sitting at a picnic table behind them takes a swig from a bottle wrapped in a plastic bag.

But Josh wanted to contribute to Thomas's good deeds. He reached into his wallet again and gave him another $100.

""You just touched my heart,"" he told his new friend.

Thomas was stunned again.

""I don't know what to say. Usually I'm pretty talkative,"" he replied.

Thomas explained that he recently quit his job and was caring for his ailing stepfather who ultimately died of cancer. His mom died two weeks later from kidney failure and suddenly their building was sold leaving Thomas without a place to live.

""There's a lot of people that are just victims of circumstance. There's a lot of good people that are homeless,"" he said. ""You're doing good … you'll bump into good people. That's all there is to it. You're on a different path somehow in life. I can't explain it.""

But Josh is trying to change his path.

He established a fund-raising campaign to help Thomas get a new home and a job.

The fund had a goal of $10,000 but it surpassed $55,000 through Wednesday morning.

""People think I changed his life,"" Josh told TODAY. ""For me, it's completely the opposite. I feel that he changed my life.""

202,Boko Haram denies it has agreed ceasefire,"“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2015 that is scheduled to be released during winter. The latest reports, however, claim that J.J. Abrams, the director of the seventh episode of the epic space opera, wants an early release date for his movie.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is currently scheduled to be released on Dec. 18, 2015. Based on YouTuber Votesaxon 07’s video, Movie Pilot reports that J.J. Abrams wants to release “Episode 7” in the summer of 2015. The report by the aforementioned entertainment news publication claims that the 48-year-old director made the announcement at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015.

The publication claims that the reason why J.J. Abrams wants to release “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” almost six months before its scheduled date is the alleged plot and images leaks from the sets and script. The moviemaker is now worried that these plot leaks will make the film “predictable and not worth watching” for the audience.

According to the website, moving the release date forward would be “an extremely brave move,” putting it up against other fan-favourite releases such as “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Jurassic World” and “Ant-Man.” However, shifting the release date means a lot of work for the moviemakers and the studio. Meanwhile, Ikwiz reports that Disney is “seriously” considering J.J. Abrams' demand of summer release of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

Fans must note that these reports lack official comments from the associated parties; thus, the information must be taken with a pinch of salt. However, fans know that Disney is seriously dealing with the issue of image leak. Recently, the studio issued a subpoena over the leak of images from “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

In additional news, J.J. Abrams finally broke his silence on the controversy over the new lightsaber that debuted in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” trailer. Speaking to Collider at a Hollywood event, the director admitted receiving tons of emails arguing about the new lightsaber and its functionality.

""It's been the funniest thing to see the arguments that have developed over this thing,” J.J Abrams said. ""This was not done without a lot of conversation. It's fun to see people have the conversation that we had, but in reverse,” the director explained.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” features John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, Harrison For as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as Leia, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, and Domhnall Gleeson, Max von Sydow and Adam Driver, all in unspecified roles. Stay tuned for more updates.

204,Who Is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau? Ottawa Shooter Suspect Identified By Canadian Officials ,"Online reports in jihadi and Palestinian forums claim Gill Rosenberg was captured by Islamic State group in embattled town of Kobani.

Gill Rosenberg, the Israeli-Canadian who joined Kurdish forces in their battles against the radical Islamic State terror group has been reportedly taken captive by the group, unconfirmed reports claimed.

Rosenberg, 31, is a civil aviation pilot who enlisted in an Israeli army search-and-rescue unit before being arrested in 2009, extradited to the United States and jailed over an international phone scam, one of her former lawyers said.

Rosenberg said that she had made contact with the Kurds through Facebook, asking them to allow her to join the Kurdish People's Protection Units, commonly known as the YPG.

On her Facebook page, Rosenberg shared her plans for her mission in Syria two months in advance, when she uploaded a picture from Jerusalem showing an Israeli flag next to an Islamic State flag, and continued posting images until her November 1, her final day in Israel.

She later posted pictures from Queen Alia International Airport in Amman, Jordan, and then from Erbil International Airport in Kurdistan. On November 9, she uploaded images from the Kurdish region of Syria and wrote, ""In the IDF (Israeli army), we say 'aharai', After Me. Let's show ISIS (Islamic State) what that means."" A friend wrote, ""Take care of yourself, friend. You are one strong woman, and you'll destroy the Islamic State.""

A source in the Kurdistan region with knowledge of the issue said Rosenberg was the first foreign woman to join YPG, the Kurds' dominant fighting force in northern Syria. She has crossed into Syria and is one of around 10 Westerners recruited by YPG, the source said.

Rosenberg could not be reached by Reuters for comment. A source provided an Iraqi Kurdistan cellphone number for her, but it was turned off on Tuesday.

205,Audio recording of Michael Brown being gunned down WAS made at the time he was killed: App company appears to confirm tape of ELEVEN bullets being fired - including final volley of 'kill shots',"Planetary Alignment On Jan 4, 2015 Will Decrease Gravity For 5 Minutes Causing Partial Weightlessness.

Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015.

According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.

Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.

Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun, within an arc 95° wide. But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earth’s crust is maximum even at their closest approach.

But don’t get too excited. If you think you’ll be able to float around your house, you’re wrong. But, if you jump in the air at 9:47 AM PST, on January 4, 2015, it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 0.2 seconds.

So, mark this date on your calendar and share it with your friends! Zero gravity day is just around the corner!",unrelated
206,Islamic State releases video apparently showing the beheading of missing US journalist James Foley,"The Islamic State kidnapped American journalist James Foley on November 22, 2012.

Foley was a freelance photo journalist covering the civil war in Syria at the time.


IS has held him ever since, but today they tweeted out video of his beheading.

They want publicity from this barbaric act, and I’m loathe to give it to them even by writing a few words about it.

But their barbarity needs to be exposed.

President Obama is reluctant to do anything about the Islamic State’s spread, other than to order airstrikes. Over the past few days, those airstrikes have helped the Kurdish and Iraqi forces fight IS. Iraqi forces recaptured the strategic Mosul dam.

But IS is far from broken. They still hold Mosul and several other Iraqi and Syrian cities. They are still capturing Iraqi Christians and Yazidis and reportedly selling captured women into sex slavery. They are murdering people by the dozens, by the hundreds. IS has designs on consolidating its power in Iraq and Syria and using that as a springboard to attack the United States and Europe. Tellingly, the murderer in the IS video of Foley’s execution — which I won’t post here — has a British accent.

IS is still holding American journalist Steven Sotloff. They have tweeted photos of him kneeling in an orange jumpsuit, next to a probable executioner, and declared that his life depends on what President Obama does next.",discuss
207,Kurds Deny Gill Rosenberg was in Kobane,"There it was in the middle of a field, baking in the sun: a cache of grenades, rockets and guns. The trove was attached to a big black parachute and, as the camera focused in on the shipment, it seemed for a moment abandoned. Then you see the masked man, who sermonized for the occasion. An American airdrop of arms, he said, which had been intended for Kurdish fighters defending the city of Kobane, had fallen into the hands of the Islamic State.

“These are some of the American aid [items] that were dropped for the atheists in the” Kurdistan Workers’ Party,” the militant said in a video uploaded to jihadist social media accounts and initially reported by SITE Intelligence Group. “Ammunition, military equipment, additional equipment — these are some of the military weapons. The American forces dropped [them] … Praise be to Allah. Spoils for the mujahideen.”

News of the accidental airdrop, which the Associated Press corroborated and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed, brought fresh criticism to a military tactic — the air drop — officials said has become substantially more accurate in the past few decades, but is still evidently prone to screw-ups. And those screw-ups have popped up several times so far in the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, underscoring the dangers of trusting the winds to carry valuable resources to their targets.

In early August, the U.S. military dropped more than 7,000 gallons of water and 36,000 packaged meals onto a barren mountain near Sinjar, the hiding spot for nearly 40,000 Yazidis who fled the Islamic State under threat of genocide. Many packages reached their intended targets — the Department of Defense estimated 80 percent — but not all of them did. “Iraqi officials said that much of the U.S. aid had been ‘useless’ because it was dropped from 15,000 feet without parachutes and exploded on impact,” wrote journalist Jonathan Krohn, who claimed to be the first Western journalist on the scene. The Washington Post’s Liz Sly agreed, saying the drops “apparently went awry.”

Then NBC News reported late last month Iraqi military pilots accidentally dropped food, water and weapons to Islamic State fighters instead of to their own soldiers, who were battling to retain control of Anbar province. “Some pilots, instead of dropping these supplies over the area of the Iraqi army, threw it over an area that is controlled by ISIS fighters,” Hakim al-Zamili said, using another name for the Islamic State. “Those soldiers were in deadly need of these supplies, but because of the wrong plans of the commanders in the Iraqi army and lack of experience of the pilots, we in a way or another helped ISIS fighters to kill our soldiers.”

Another general sheepishly added: “Yes, that’s what had happened.”

The embarrassing anecdotes feed into the complicated history of the airdrop, which still carries risks despite being honed over decades with technological advancements such as GPS-guided parachutes. “There’s no way you can predict who may end up with those weapons, and who is going to use them, or how they are going to use them,” Greg Myre of the Middle East Institute told the Daily Sabah. “That is one of the risks you have to take.”

It was a risk Bill Clinton was willing to take in 1993. That was the year he ordered an airdrop of tens of thousands of humanitarian packages over eastern Bosnia, despite the “military consistently arguing against involving U.S. troops in airdrops in hostile zones, given the fact that the accuracy of the drops is questionable,” the Associated Press then reported. The brass turned out to be right.

One major problem laid bare during that mission, military scientists later said, was what they called “wind drift.” “The problem was identified in the late ’90s,” John McGinley, a scientist who researched the topic, told The Washington Post’s Holly Watt in 2008. “The terrain in Bosnia meant that instead of landing in one valley, the cargo could drift into another valley that was held by the enemy. Wind drift was causing all the problems.”

So research teams got to work, ultimately unveiling wind-forecast software that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said increased the drop’s accuracy by 70 percent. “Inaccurate wind forecasts are the main culprit in missed targets for dropping supplies and other items from high altitudes,” the report said.

It almost immediately went into use in the war in Afghanistan, where far-flung military outposts were separated by stretches of roads pockmarked with insurgents and explosives. There had to be another way to get soldiers the equipment they needed, military officials thought, so they launched a massive increase in airdrops. “We’ve gotten a lot more accurate over the years,” Air Force Gen. Arthur Lichte told USA Today.

That may true. But following this week’s alleged delivery to the Islamic State, there’s clearly still room for work.",unrelated
208,Tropical spider burrowed under man's skin through appendix scar and lived there for THREE DAYS,"Angry locals came to the teenager's aid after hearing her scream, before then dragging the man to a butchers shop

An Indian man accused of trying to rape a teenager reportedly had his penis lopped off by vigilante locals after they allegedly heard the girl’s screams.

Suresh Kumar, 40, is now recovering in hospital after he was apparently dragged into a butchers shop in the city of Ganganagar, in India’s Rajasthan state.

He had allegedly been seen pinning the petrified girl to a wall, which is when he was pulled off and taken to a store to have his genitals hacked off with a meat cleaver.

The appendage was reportedly thrown into the road, with officers now hunting down the perpetrators. He is understood to be in a critical condition, while the girl was treat for shock.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, a local, said: “No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime,” according to the Daily Mirror.

He added: “We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped.

“This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.”

The Daily Mail reports a police spokesperson as saying: “As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.

“We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.”

The Indian government has been accused of not doing enough to protect its citizens, as violent attacks against girls and women become increasingly condemned by the international community.

Meenakshi Ganguly , South Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, wrote in the Hindustan Times in August that “knee-jerk solutions like death penalty for rapists and lowering the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16 will not help end sexual violence against women.”

She added: “Instead of hasty measures, the government should make a commitment to effective law enforcement and the more difficult and lengthy steps needed to reform the criminal justice system.”

212,Russian Yeti Or Bigfoot Hoax? New Footage Sparks Debate,"Dan Olsen, a former-ish PGA Golfer, went on The Game 730 AM’s Mad Dog in the Morning on Friday, and lobbed some grenades at Tiger Woods.

It’s not testosterone but it’s something else. I think when it’s all said and done that he’s gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.”

Olsen also accused Woods of using shady golf balls, implied that there would be an institutional cover-up because the PGA needs to market Tiger, and insinuated that he’s faking his back injury. “His back’s not hurt,” Olsen said. “He was limping, and he was faking worse than I’ve ever seen him fake.”

ESPN obtained comment from the PGA, and Tiger Woods’ agent:

Ty Votaw, the executive vice president of the PGA Tour, denied any of the claims brought forth by Olsen.  “There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,” Votaw said. “We categorically deny these allegations.”

The Tour almost never comments on disciplinary matters. Woods said on Feb. 11 that he was taking a break to deal with the issues in his game after withdrawing during the first round last month of the Farmers Insurance Open. “Over the past year, Woods has withdrawn with an injury three times and now fallen outside of the 70 in the world. These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,” said Woods’ agent, Mark Steinberg, in a statement. “They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous.

213,Tropical spider burrowed under Bali tourist's skin,"An Australian tourist’s holiday in Bali ended horrifyingly when doctors were forced to pull a tropical spider out of his stomach.

Medical staff at Bali International Medical Centre said the spider had burrowed itself into Dylan Thomas’s skin through a scar from where his appendix had been removed.

The 21-year-old, from Bunbury, Western Australia, told NT News he woke up on Saturday morning to find a 2-inch red trail rising up from his stomach.

Later that day it had risen two or three inches higher up his body, he said.

When he first went to doctors on Sunday they told him it was an insect bite and gave him some cream, NT News reported.

By Monday morning the trail had started to blister.

Then Thomas saw a dermatologist, who recognised things were not right.

Doctors operated and removed a spider the size of a match head from his body.

Thomas told NT News:

“It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated.

“It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days.”

The spider, which was dead when it was removed, has been sent off for tests, and Thomas is expected to learn what species it was in the coming days. He summed up his experience on Thursday:

The Bunbury Mail said Thomas was now hoping his friends would help him raise enough money for a Spider-Man tattoo on his chest.

He is also apparently hoping the ordeal leaves a “gnarly scar” on his body.

update

A number of scientists in Perth have now cast doubt over Thomas’ claims and said the red trail may have been caused by a mite rather than a spider.

The student, Mohammed Islam, is profiled in this year’s edition of New York magazine’s annual treat, “Reasons to Love New York.” Islam is the son of Bengali immigrants, and he and a few other pint-size, hobbyist traders and poker players appear to have created a cool nerd gang for the ages—dining at Morimoto and Mari Vanna, where they toss back apple juice and caviar.

216,Mexico Says Missing Students Not Found In First Mass Graves,"Nigeria's military says it has agreed a ceasefire with Islamist militants Boko Haram - and that the schoolgirls the group has abducted will be released.

Nigeria's chief of defence staff, Alex Badeh, announced the truce. Boko Haram has not made a public statement.

The group has been fighting an insurgency since 2009, with some 2,000 civilians reportedly killed this year.

Boko Haram sparked global outrage six months ago by abducting more than 200 schoolgirls.

The girls were seized in the north-eastern town of Chibok in Borno state, and their continued captivity has led to criticism of the Nigerian government's efforts to secure their release.

Members of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign said in a tweet on Friday: ""We are monitoring the news with huge expectations.""

'Cautiously optimistic'

Air Chief Marshal Badeh revealed the truce at the close of a three-day security meeting between Nigeria and Cameroon. He said Nigerian soldiers would comply with the agreement.

Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told BBC Focus on Africa that the agreement was sealed after a month of negotiations, mediated by Chad.

As part of the talks, a government delegation twice met representatives of the Islamist group.

Mr Tukur said Boko Haram had announced a unilateral ceasefire on Thursday and the government had responded.

""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" he said.

""I am cautiously optimistic.""

He said arrangements for their release would be finalised at another meeting next week in Chad's capital, Ndjamena.

The negotiations are said to have the blessing of Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, reports the BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja.

Speaking to the BBC, Nigerian government spokesman Mike Omeri said Boko Haram would not be given territory under the ceasefire agreement - and that the government would not reveal what concessions it would make.

""We are inching closer to release of all groups in captivity, including the Chibok girls,"" he said.

Analysis: Will Ross, BBC News, Lagos

Nigerian officials had not given any indication that negotiations with Boko Haram were taking place. Even though there had been rumours of talks in neighbouring Chad, this is a very surprising development.

Many Nigerians are extremely sceptical about the announcement especially as there has been no definitive word from the jihadists.

The military has in the past released statements about the conflict in north-east Nigeria that have turned out to be completely at odds with the situation on the ground.

So many here will only celebrate when the violence stops and the hostages are free.

In May 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan imposed a state of emergency in the northern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa, vowing to crush the Islamist insurgency.

But Boko Haram increased its attacks this year.

The group promotes a version of Islam which makes it ""haram"", or forbidden, for Muslims to take part in any political or social activity associated with Western society.

It frequently attacks schools and colleges, which it sees as a symbol of Western culture.

Human Rights Watch has reported that 2,053 civilian were killed in the first half of the year, while Amnesty International estimated that 4,000 people were killed in violence - including Nigerian military operations - in the first seven months of 2014.

Boko Haram is seeking to establish an Islamist state in Nigeria, but its fighters often cross the long and porous border with Cameroon.

Eight Cameroon soldiers and more than 100 Boko Haram militants were killed in fighting in the far north of Cameroon on Friday, Reuters quoted the country's defence ministry as saying.

In July, Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad and Niger agreed to form a 2,800-strong regional force to tackle Boko Haram militants.",unrelated
217,Boko Haram denies ceasefire claim by Nigeria's government,"A year before North Korean leader Kim Jong-un came to power, a directive was issued for anyone sharing his name to change it – maintaining a tradition upheld by the reclusive state’s ruling Kim dynasty, a report said.

An internal state document obtained by South Korea’s KBS TV station contains an “administrative order” from then leader Kim Jong-il for all party, army and police officials to ensure the directive was carried out. The order was issued in January 2011, shortly after Kim Jong-un had been anointed as his father’s successor. Kim Jong-il died in December of the same year.

“All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-un … and train them to voluntarily change their names,” said the document, extracts of which were aired by KBS on Tuesday.

The process involved revising names on official documents, including social security cards and school diplomas. Officials were also directed to reject birth certificates for any newborns named Kim Jong-un.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip … regarding this project,” it added.

The authenticity of the official directive could not be independently verified, and Seoul’s unification ministry declined to comment on whether it was genuine.

But one government official noted that the Pyongyang regime was known to have banned citizens sharing the names of founding president Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il.

“Given the North maintained the policy under the two previous leaders, there is a possibility that it would continue to do so now,” the official said.

The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea for more than six decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult.

Park Jin-hee, a North Korean defector working for KBS who obtained the document, said she was sure the 2011 directive had been effectively enforced.

“There is no one in the North named Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-un,” Park, who defected in 2008, said.",unrelated

The small time capsule is believed to contain items such as old coins, documents, newspapers and a metal plate that was owned by Revere.

Secretary of State William Galvin speculated that some of the items could have deteriorated over time.

Official plan to X-ray the capsule on Sunday at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts to get some idea of the contents and possibly details on their condition, then open it next week.

Originally made of cowhide, the time capsule was believed to have been embedded in the cornerstone when construction on the state Capitol began in 1795. Adams was governor of Massachusetts at the time.

The time capsule was removed in the mid-19th century and its contents transferred to a copper box, Galvin said. Its removal Thursday was due to an ongoing water filtration project at the building. Galvin said the plan is to return it to the site sometime next year.

Pamela Hatchfield, a conservator at the museum, was exhausted Thursday after spending hours chiseling and drilling on the massive cornerstone, taking care not to damage the time capsule or coins that were thrown in the mortar that held it in place.

She held up the capsule for viewing by state officials, reporters and contractors involved in the renovation of the Statehouse.

'It's heavy,' Hatchfield said. 'I feel happy and relieved and excited and really interested to see what's in this box.'

Hatchfield said state officials did not know that the time capsule was embedded in the cornerstone until 60 years after some of the nation's leading founding political figures put it there.

'It was first put in there in 1795 by Paul Revere and Sam Adams and was unearthed accidentally when in 1855 there were some amendments to the building,' Hatchfield said. 'They put the contents back into a new box and placed it in a depression in the stone, which is on the underside.'

Galvin said there were notes from 1855 indicating that officials washed some of the contents in the capsule with acid before putting them in the new copper box.

It also was a humid day when the items were restored and, Galvin said, the corner of the Statehouse where the capsule was fixed has had a water leakage problem for 30 years.

'We have to see what held up since that time,' he said. 'That's the biggest question we have right now — are the contents in good condition or not?'

Galvin said the Massachusetts Statehouse is one of the oldest, active statehouses in the country.

'Obviously, when we talk about the original box being presided over by then-Gov. Sam Adams, Paul Revere, it's pretty significant,' he said. 'I'm very fond of saying ... that the history of Massachusetts is the history of America, and it's very true and this is another evidence of that.'

The excavation came just months after another time capsule was uncovered from the Old State House, which served as the state's first seat of government. That long-forgotten time capsule, dating to 1901, turned up in a lion statue atop the building and, when opened, was found to contain a potpourri of well-preserved items including newspaper clippings, a book on foreign policy and a letter from journalists of the period.",unrelated

But it's never had a true, physical retail store, at least not until now. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Amazon plans to open its first physical store, and that it will be located in midtown Manhattan, right in the heart of New York City. It'll be located on 34th Street, right between the flagship Macy's store and the Empire State Building.

In a way, the store will reportedly be just an extension of what Amazon already does in its physical spaces. Amazon will accept returns at the location, and will use it as a mini-warehouse particularly tuned for same-day delivery of products in New York. You'll also be able to pick up online orders at the store, meaning you'll be able to buy online and get items even faster. Amazon may also use the store to show off its Kindle and Fire products, which seems like a spectacularly obvious thing to do but is evidently still only being considered.

Of course, there's potential to do much more. Amazon's been building to this: the company launched a tool for identifying products, a card-reader for buying them, and much more that suggests it could quickly build a full-fledged physical retail space. It's been rumored for years that Amazon would do this, and even now Amazon tells the Journal that this is just an experiment.

The store is apparently slated to be open in time for the holidays, and could be the beginning of an entirely new branch of competition between Amazon and its biggest brick-and-mortar competitors.",unrelated

An Islamic State message published by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist activity, said the American woman, Kayla Mueller, was killed when the building where she was being held in the Raqqa area collapsed in an airstrike.

“The failed Jordanian aircraft killed an American female hostage,” said the message. “No mujahid was injured in the bombardment, and all praise is due to Allah.” Mujahid means fighter.

There was no immediate way to verify the claim by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. But it identified the hostage by name for the first time, and gave her address in Prescott, Ariz., apparently to add credibility to its message. The group also posted photographs of an obliterated house where, it said, Ms. Mueller's body had been buried beneath the rubble.

The White House said American intelligence officials were investigating the claim.

“We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports,” said Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council. “We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL’s claim.”

Jordanian officials cast doubt on the Islamic State's claim but did not explicitly rule it out. Jordan's foreign minister, Nasser S. Judeh, said on his Twitter account that the claim was “An old and sick trick used by terrorists and despots for decades: claiming that hostages human shields held captive are killed by air raids.”

The Islamic State, which occupies parts of Syria and Iraq, has executed three other American hostages, all men, in beheadings that it posted on the Internet. An American-led coalition that includes Jordan and other Arab allies of the United States has been bombing Islamic State targets on a frequent basis for months.

Ms. Mueller, 26, the only known remaining American hostage held by the Islamic State, is a humanitarian aid worker who disappeared in August 2013 after she had driven into the northern Syria city of Aleppo with her Syrian boyfriend. Her colleagues received a proof-of-life video a few months later, showing her wearing a hijab and begging for her life.

Her family had asked news organizations to avoid identifying her by name while she was still in captivity. But the Islamic State's use of her name in its message on Friday changed their thinking, even though there was no proof she had been killed.

In a statement about Ms. Mueller, the family called her a passionate aid worker who had been taken captive by the Islamic State after she had left an Aleppo hospital run by Doctors Without Borders, the medical charity.

“The common threat of Kayla's life has been her quiet leadership and strong desire to serve others,"" the statement said.

Ms. Mueller, the statement said, had “devoted her career to helping those in need in countries around the world.”

The immolation death of the Jordanian pilot, First Lt. Moaz al-Kasasbeh, 26, which was posted on the Internet in a carefully produced Islamic State video on Tuesday, generated new levels of world outrage. It was never made clear when the pilot, who was captured in late December, had been killed.

Jordan hung two convicted terrorist prisoners, including a woman, in retaliation on Wednesday and launched bombing attacks on Islamic State targets in neighboring Syria as a further response for vengeance.

A senior United States military official with knowledge of the targets attacked by the Jordanians said the targets in and around Raqqa that were struck were carefully vetted and scrutinized, as with previous strikes, and there were no indications in advance that any hostages were located at the facilities.

“The same high standards we apply to all targets in the vetting stage were applied to these,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations. “If there’s any inkling a person like that was there, we don’t go there.”

The official cautioned that without proof of the American hostage’s death, the statement by the Islamic State could be a ploy to cause the Jordanians and the rest of the American-led coalition to refrain from any heavier airstrikes.

The official said though the Jordanian fighter jets took the lead in the strike in and around Raqqa, they were accompanied by American aircraft, as is standard on bombing runs over territory held by the Islamic State in Syria.",unrelated
227,Meteorite Leaves House-Sized Crater in Nicaragua’s Capital,"Some 219 years ago, founding fathers Sam Adams and Paul Revere looked on as a bit of history was tucked into a corner stone of the Massachusetts State House. On Thursday, excavators carefully extracted the keepsakes, according to the Boston Globe.

The time capsule, contained in a 5-by-7-inch copper box, is thought to hold a collection of coins and other artifacts dating as far back as 1652. The capsule had actually already been extracted in 1855, when the original cowhide capsule was replaced with the metal box and new items, including coins from the 1800s, were added to the stash.The box had then been mortared inside the State House cornerstone.

Meghan Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Administration and Finance, told the Globe the box may also hold an engraved silver plate, newspapers, the seal of the Commonwealth, cards and the title page of the Massachusetts Colony Records.

Time Capsule Has Steve Jobs' Computer Mouse

It’s believed to be one of the oldest time capsules ever recovered in the state — and likely would have remained in place had it not been for concerns that water had been seeping into the State House at that particular corner. That inspection prompted officials to re-excavate the time capsule to investigate its contents and make sure the items are in good condition.

“Hopefully there will be no damage and we will be able to observe the artifacts that trace us back to the history not only just of this building, but of our Commonwealth and our country,” said Secretary of State William Galvin, who was on hand for the capsule’s excavation, according to the Boston Globe.

As luck would have it, another time capsule was recovered in Boston just this past October. That 100-year-old capsule was extracted from its holding in the head of a golden lion statue that had perched atop the Old State House in downtown Boston. That capsule held sealed letters, photographs, and newspaper articles.

As for this most recently extracted time capsule, it’s now being held in a safe at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. On Sunday examiners will X-ray the box and they plan to carefully open it and inspect its contents next week. After that, it will be returned to the State House cornerstone, perhaps with a few new items added for future generations to rediscover.

228,Does Vogue's New Office Have a Rat Infestation?,"The World Health Organization is looking into reports that ISIS fighters in Iraq have been showing up at hospitals with Ebola symptoms.

According to the pro-government Iraqi newspaper al Sabaah, an unknown number of ISIS militants have shown up at a hospital in the militant-controlled city of Mosul, about 250 miles north of Baghdad. The paper reported that foreign terrorists brought the disease into Mosul from “several countries” in Africa. (RELATED: ISIS Massacred Every Man And Boy Over 15 In Muslim Town)

It’s not yet clear whether the ISIS extremists actually have Ebola or another disease. Ebola symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea and unexplained bleeding and bruising — problems which could also be attributed to malaria or yellow fever. And doctors in Mosul might be unable to even test for Ebola.

WHO spokeswoman Christy Feig said the organization is reaching out to officials in the ISIS-held area to offer help if the disease does turn out to be Ebola. However, United Nations workers are not allowed to work in ISIS-controlled areas in either Iraq or Syria, so a UN operation to help either ISIS militants or any civilians in the areas who contract Ebola is unlikely.

Feig told Mashable that there’s been no official notification from the Iraqi government that the terrorists’ disease is, in fact, Ebola.

ISIS is against western science and medicine as a rule, but apparently several militants have taken to hospitals with Ebola-like symptoms anyway. Since taking control of Mosul in June 2014, ISIS has taken to executing doctors that refuse to treat them.

Kurdish news website Rudaw reported in Nov. 2014 that ISIS executed six doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded fighters, in addition to kidnapping six merchants for failing to pay a monthly tax to ISIS. The group reportedly executed two more doctors just last week.

The U.S. has been hitting ISIS with air strikes since mid-November and the Pentagon confirmed in December that the strikes have killed around 1,000 fighters, including three senior ISIS officials.

An Ebola outbreak, however unlikely, probably wouldn’t help matters much.

229,Meteorite leaves crater in Nicaraguan capital Managua,"CHILPANCINGO, Mexico (AP) — Authorities testing remains found in nine mass graves in southern Mexico have yet to find any of 43 teachers college students who disappeared after a confrontation with police, security officials said Tuesday.

None were among 28 bodies, some badly burned, that were unearthed a week after the Sept. 26 attack, Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said.

Forensic investigators continued to test other remains and announced the discovery of 10th mass grave Tuesday.

Relatives of missing students march with flowers and candles to protest the disappearance of 43 students from the Isidro Burgos rural teachers college in Chilpancingo, Mexico, Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2014.

Authorities have said police involved in ""disappearing"" the students were working in conjunction with a local drug gang. (AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo)

An additional 14 police officers have been arrested and confessed to participating in the disappearance, Murillo Karam said, bringing the total number of detainees to 50.

The 14 are from the police force of Cocula, a town neighboring Iguala, where the confrontation took place in the southern state of Guerrero. Both the mayor and police chief of Iguala are fugitives and accused of links to the local drug cartel, Guerrero Unidos, believed to have worked with police in disappearing the students.

The gang controls drug routes in Guerrero and Morelos states.

Murillo Karam said that officials had yet to identify the masterminds or a motive in the attack, but that the collusion might have gone beyond just one town.

""There's a connection. We will determine if it was coordination or subordination, but it's clear to me that they were working together,"" he said of police and drug traffickers in the area.

Police opened fire on about 100 students who had hijacked buses to return to campus after arriving in Iguala to pass the hat for their school. Teachers college students are known throughout Mexico for using radical tactics to raise money and spread their leftist philosophy.

Six people were killed, 25 wounded and dozens of students rounded up by police. There has been no sign of the missing in nearly three weeks, leading investigators to comb the clandestine burial sites outside of Iguala, where drug cartels are believed to dump their enemies.

On Tuesday, Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre said many of the bodies at the first site appeared to have been buried for some time, suggesting they belonged to earlier victims of criminal gangs.

""Some of them are not recent, some are from months ago,"" Aguirre told MVS radio.

One forensic expert, who works with federal investigators, said identification is an arduous process that takes time. Charred remains like those recovered at the first mass graves can leave very little DNA for testing.

""If a bone is burned at more than 300 degrees, it's almost impossible to identify because the collagen is burned. Because of that, criminal organizations started to adopt that technique,"" said Jorge Arturo Talavera, head of the bio-archaeology team at the Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History.

He said the way the remains are exhumed also can affect identification. If they're pulled out in a hurried manner, other identifying articles like jewelry or teeth get discarded.

Hundreds of teachers, students and relatives of the missing marched to the center of the state capital, Chilpancingo, on Tuesday, taking a much more solemn tone after a night of angry protests and vandalism that badly damaged the state capital building.

They lined up in silence as organizers passed out white flowers. Some carried candles with a sprawling billboard offering a 1 million peso ($75,000) reward for information.

On Monday, protesters demanding to know the whereabouts of the missing smashed windows at the state capital building complex in Chilpancingo, 132 miles (212 kilometers) south of Mexico City, and set fire to some of the buildings.

Students from the school and local teachers blockaded the capital complex, pelting it with sticks, rocks and Molotov cocktails. The finance secretary of Guerrero state said six buildings were affected.

Also Tuesday, an alleged leader of the Guerreros Unidos killed himself during a confrontation with Mexican security forces Tuesday. Federal forces were carrying out an operation to capture Benjamin Mondragon, or ""Benjamon,"" when a gunbattle broke out, National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido said.

Mondragon killed himself as he was about to be arrested, Rubido said, though he had no details on how.

The official said it was unclear whether Mondragon was involved in the students' disappearances.

President Enrique Pena Nieto said the disappearances ""are without doubt a topic that will lead the Mexican government at all levels to take actions that will prevent events like those in Iguala from ever occurring again."" He said the government ""will strengthen institutions, especially those involved in law enforcement, so that they act with greater reliability and efficiency.""

230,James Foley remembered as 'brave and tireless' journalist,"Following the deadly shootings at Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine with a history of lampooning religious extremism, cartoonists came out in droves to support those who were killed Wednesday in the best way they knew how: with their own set of tribute cartoons. Artists from The Independent, The Washington Post, and more published visual depictions of their reaction to the news of the attack, which took the lives of 12 people, a death toll that included four prominent cartoonists. (Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier was perhaps the most high-profile of those killed Wednesday.) And — for those who flocked to Facebook, Instagram, and other forms of social media Wednesday — it appeared that Banksy had dedicated his own cartoon to the tragedy. But, come Wednesday night, fans of the elusive street artist would be disappointed to learn that, no, Banksy likely did not draw the stunning pencil image.  

Though it at first appeared as though the artist was responsible for the cartoon after it surfaced on a Banksy Instagram account, it’s believed that the account does not belong to Banksy himself. Not only because Banksy’s official website insists that the artist keeps off social media — specifically referencing his lack of a Facebook or Twitter account (this short-lived Instagram was the only account that was ever linked to Banksy) — but also, as Business Insider notes, the cartoon image is far too low-res for an artist with Banksy’s notoriety. Writes the site:

Another clue that points to the image being fake is its file size. The image uploaded to the fake Banksy social media posts is pixelated and low-resolution. Banksy is an artist who makes a living from exhibiting his work, he wouldn’t want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad.
That said, the image itself is striking, and a fitting tribute to those who have passed on following the shootings in Paris. So, though it’s possible Banksy did not design the cartoon (and only leaves you wondering what kind of tribute Banksy would publish), it’s worth digesting, appreciating, and using it to remember that violence will never quell freedom of speech.",unrelated

Nothing leaked, of course, on the identity of religious, nor on physical features of the infant. Mystery over whether resembles more the mother rather than the father. And if you do not ask to be born was a boy or a girl as in lane embarrassments are palpable. We only know that the mother of the unborn child, the original of a state in South America, would arrive in Macerata for some time and would find accommodation, perhaps refuge in a cloistered in our province. It is also hard to say whether the sister has or less confessed his sin, not venial, to his superior. We know, however, that the religious would come first to the emergency room, and later would bring up the ward, accompanied by other sisters who, even before a miracle, they entrusted the prayer of the Lord who in the meantime was to come to light. The entrance to the acceptance took place Sunday and was, however, a great day of celebration for the arrival of a new life.

232,Reports: Big Bank Hank of pioneering rap group Sugarhill Gang has died,"His voice served as a call to action, an echo that continues today whenever a kid bellows the word “hip hop” into a microphone. It was in Henry “Big Bank Hank” Jackson’s lyrical wobble, the way he rapped through the Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight,” the singular hit that propelled a movement when it was released in 1979.

Jackson, 57, died Tuesday morning after complications from cancer, but his influence remains.

The news was confirmed by David Mallie, the business manager for the two surviving members of the original Sugarhill Gang, Guy “Master Gee” O’Brien and “Wonder Mike” Wright.

Hank was introducing a flow that in the decades to come would move through culture one boasted rhyme at a time.
-  
“They say that miracles never cease, I’ve created a devastating masterpiece,” rapped Big Bank Hank on “Rapper’s Delight,” a boast that codified one of rap’s central themes -- self-aggrandizement. Little did he know at the time how accurate he was, and that through said devastation Hank was introducing a flow that in the decades to come would move through culture one boasted rhyme at a time.

As seen on a widely circulating YouTube clip in performance on a local dance show, Big Bank Hank performs with a violet Kangol-style hat and a too-tight T-shirt. The hearty emcee grooves as he rhymes (lip-synced though it may be), lost in music with a fluid pelvic wobble. Next to the more restrained Wonder Mike and Master Gee, he is rap-funk personified. Hank embodies his verse as he raps of out-lasting Superman with a funny line belittling the superhero’s manhood. It's no match for Hank’s “super sperm.”

“I’m here, I’m there, I’m Big Bank Hank, everywhere,” he raps. Again, he had no idea how true that was, though he witnessed the music's evolution over the following decades as the hip-hop style he helped popularize become a form as vital to the ever-evolving story of American music as jazz and country and western.

This line, from the same verse, part of a larger bit involving a sexy reporter, further underscores his import: “She said she’s heard stories and she’s heard fables/That I’m vicious on the mike and the turntables.” That little turn of phrase carved into wax rap’s ongoing love-affair with turntables and microphones.

In the formative “Apache,” the Gang harnessed the titular brass and bongo breakbeat while they shouted, “Tonto, jump on it! Kemosabe, jump on it!” Big Bank Hank then made another claim: “I’m the one who shot Jesse James!”

To call the Sugarhill Gang the “big bang” of hip-hop diminishes the contributions of an entire community that imagined the music at its inception. Big Bank Hank, after all, got his start in the business as a bouncer and managing an act that would become the Cold Crush Brothers. He landed a spot in the Sugarhill Gang when the late music executive Sylvia Robinson tapped him to be part of a pop-oriented rap trio she was putting together.

Jeff Chang’s essential history of hip hop, “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop,” describes the song as standing out amid party-oriented rap of the time due to the group’s birth as a studio creation.


Writes Chang, “Their raps on ‘Rapper’s Delight’ were the stuff that sounded good not in the parties, but on the live bootleg cassettes playing in the OJ cabs and on the boom-boxes --- the funny stories, the hookish slang, the same kind of stuff that would strike listeners around the world as both universal and new, not local and insular.”

“Rapper’s Delight” is considered the best selling 12-inch single of all time, though that’s tough to confirm in the pre-Soundscan era, which began in 1991 (and various litigation involving the track’s unapproved sampling of Chic’s “Good Times” further blurred the issue of numbers).

As happened with most first-generation rap teams (and second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-), Sugarhill Gang failed to sustain a bankable post-hit career, and didn’t receive royalty checks equal to its influence. In the years following the track's success, the style morphed in dozens of different directions, though, becoming politicized through Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, electro-fied through Afrika Bambaataa and popularized through Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys. 

Reverse engineer virtually any rap song since, and the circuitry leads back to ""Rapper's Delight,"" and by extension, Big Bank Hank. His phrasing, his fluid, funky tone, has endured, passed down from rapper to rapper, an invisible but essential presence.

233,Islamic State using 'SCORPION bombs' to terrorise victims,"A South American nun suddenly started experiencing sharp pains, and not long after being rushed to the hospital, she gave birth to a baby boy. Now, the nun is claiming that she had no idea she was pregnant.

Reports say that the Catholic sister, originally from South America, belonged to an order in Macerata, Italy and had only arrived at the convent in June. Recently, after experiencing sudden sharp stomach pains, the sister was rushed to the hospital by her fellow nuns and was told she was pregnant. Soon after, she gave birth to a baby boy.

234,Kim Jong-un ‘is so fat from eating cheese that he has broken his ankles’,"A British rapper whose father is awaiting trial in Manhattan for a pair of US embassy bombings is a leading suspect in the barbaric beheading of American journalist James Foley, it was revealed on Friday.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary — who recently tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head — was among three Brits identified as possibly being the masked killer known as “John the Beatle.” Bary, 24, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on terror charges tied to the deadly 1998 bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Also under investigation are the brother of a British doctor once charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents, and a former gang member who converted to Islam and traveled to Syria, Britain’s Telegraph newspaper reported.

A dozen American counterterrorism experts are expected to fly to the UK “within days” to help identify Foley’s killer, Britain’s Daily Mail reported.

Former hostages held by ISIS have said he is one of several jihadists they nicknamed “the Beatles” due to their British accents, with two of his cronies referred to as “George” and “Ringo.”

Bary, who went to Syria last year to fight in its bloody civil war, has a build, skin tone and ­accent all similar to those of “John,” according to The Telegraph.

Before becoming a jihadist, he was an aspiring rapper from West London known as “L Jinny,” whose music was played on BBC Radio 1.

Bary also appeared in music videos posted on YouTube for songs titled “Overdose,” “Flying High” and “Dreamer.”

But he was reportedly radicalized by followers of firebrand ­Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and walked out of his family’s plush home in the Maida Vale district of London last year, saying he was “leaving everything for the sake of Allah.”

Earlier this month, he was seen in a photo posted to Twitter wearing camouflage clothing and a black balaclava while holding a severed head with his left hand — the same hand “John” is seen using to draw a knife across Foley’s throat in his execution video.

According to The Telegraph, Bary is on an official list of British jihadists who may be “John.”

Also on the list is Razul Islam, 21, the paper says.

In 2012, Islam’s two older brothers — including Dr. Shajul Islam, a suspended physician with England’s National Health Service — were charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents near the Syrian border with Turkey.

But the brothers were released last year after neither British journalist John Cantile nor Dutch photographer Jeroen Oerlmans appeared to testify against them.

Another suspect is Aine Davis, 30, a former drug dealer and gang member who The Telegraph said converted to Islam and flew to Syria to wage jihad.",unrelated

The world will remain, during these three days, without sunlight due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight.

This is the head of NASA Charles Bolden who made the announcement and asked everyone to remain calm. This will be the product of a solar storm, the largest in the last 250 years for a period of 216 hours total. Reporters interviewed a few people to hear what they had to say about the situation with Michael Hearns responding “We gonna be purgin my n*gga, six days of darkness means six days of turnin up fam”.

Despite the six days of darkness soon to come, officials say that the earth will not experience any major problems, since six days of darkness is nowhere near enough to cause major damage to anything. “We will solely rely on artificial light for the six days, which is not a problem at all”, says NASA scientist Earl Godoy.

236,"Vice Media Chief Said to Pay $300,000 for Dinner for 30","Vice founder Shane Smith, with something that is not caviar.  Via twitter.com

Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Vice founder Shane Smith recently balled out exceptionally hard on a dinner for a group of 12 at the Prime Steakhouse in Las Vegas, racking up a $300,000 check.

A source at Vice told BuzzFeed News that Smith won a sum “well north of that bill” while gambling during his week at the CES conference in Las Vegas, and paid for the dinner on his personal credit card. (A Financial Times report says Smith won $1 million; both the FT and New York Times say there were about 30 people eating on Smith’s dime.)

Smith himself hasn’t commented on the story, which is a pity, because the world needs to know the answer to a crucial question: How can you spend $300,000 on dinner?

Short of a how-to guide from the man himself, or a member of his $2.5 billion digital media empire, we’re left to speculate. So in that spirit, we checked out the menu at Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino. Here’s our best guess of how Smith and a party of 12 could have racked up a tab the value of a single-family home.

Prime’s Siberian Sturgeon Caviar with traditional accompaniments was likely a must for Smith’s group. The restaurant lists the item as market price, but Eater Las Vegas has it going for up to $2,500 per pound. A couple pounds of caviar seems reasonable.

ALLEKO/ALLEKO

Mercifully for Smith, Prime doesn’t put its wine list online. But just down the strip at Mario Batali’s Carnevino in the Wynn, a few bottles of Dom Perignon (2003) will run guests $400 each.

Jay L. Clendenin/Los Angeles Times / MCT

But what are we, farmers? Any respectable internet baron is going to spring for a couple of bottles of the best champagne in the house. At Batali’s joint, a 1.5-liter bottle of Boërl & Kroff 1998 will set you back $15,000 each.

Obviously white wine accompanies any good foodie’s fish course. Smith’s crew could have grabbed a couple bottles of the $9,000 Montrachet, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti from 2007. An average year, but sometimes compromise is necessary.

Manakin/Manakin

For the reds, perhaps a couple of vintages on the more reasonable side, like the $5,000 per bottle Sine Qua Non “Just for the Love of It” 2002 Syrah.

237,ISIS Getting Ebola,"DNA tests have confirmed that a daughter and an ex-wife of the head of Isis, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, are indeed being held by Lebanese authorities.

There have been conflicting reports about the identity of the woman, with an Iraqi official denying on Wednesday she was al-Baghdadi's ex wife.

But a Lebanese interior minister confirmed today that the woman and child who were detained about 10 days ago in northern Lebanon travelling with a fake ID are in fact the ex wife and daughter of the terrorist leader.

Islamic State (IS) group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addresses worshippers at a mosque in Mosul, after he established a self-declared caliphate across Iraq and Syria on July 5, 2014

The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi, was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday.

He said DNA tests showed that the girl was Baghdadi's child.

'Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,' he said.

'Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child,' Mashnuq added.

'We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is his (Baghdadi's) daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq,' the minister said.

The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi (pictured), was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday

He gave no details on Dulaimi's nationality, but a security source said she was believed to be Iraqi.

Mashnuq offered no further information about her current husband, although he said investigations showed the woman had ties to extremists in Lebanon.

Dulaimi's children were at a children's care centre while she was being interrogated, he said.

Mashnuq also confirmed the arrest of the wife of Anas Sharkas, a leader in Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front.

Dulaimi was among a group of female prisoners released from Syrian jails in March, in exchange for 13 nuns from the ancient town of Maalula held by Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front.

The Islamic State (IS) group has yet to comment publicly on Dulaimi's detention, but Al-Nusra, despite a feud with Baghdadi's group, issued a statement of condemnation.

It described her as 'sister Saja al-Dulaimi' and said the arrest of women and children was evidence of the 'weakness' of the Lebanese state.

Sources said the detention of Dulaimi and Sharkas's wife could help the Lebanese as they struggle to negotiate the release of 27 members of the security forces held by jihadists from IS and Al-Nusra.

The soldiers and police were abducted when militants from the two groups briefly overran the Lebanese border town of Arsal in August.

239,Apple Watch may be powered by Samsung processor,"The Islamic State released a video of its jihadists beheading American journalist James Wright Foley in Syria. The video is almost five minutes long and includes threats against President Barack Obama and the United States.
In the video, which was temporarily available on YouTube but has since been removed, the terrorists remind the audience Obama authorized military action against IS and replayed Obama’s press conference when he announced the airstrikes. To them the declaration is a “slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims.”
Foley then appears on his knees in an orange jumpsuit. He relays a message that the US government is his true killer. He addresses his family as well. The message is choppy, which gives the appearance that he is reading off cards placed in front of the camera.
His executioner speaks with what appears to be a British accent, saying many Muslims worldwide accepted IS and a war against IS is, in essence, a war against Muslims. The UK has been one of the Islamic State's most active targets of recruitment.
After he beheads Foley, he presents to the camera another journalist, Steven Joel Soltoff, who worked for Time and The National Interest. Soltoff was reported missing in the middle of last year. The executioner said America’s next move will determine IS’s next move in what appears to be a threat against the second journalist.
Foley was an independent journalist in the Middle East. In 2011, he was one of four journalists kidnapped by Qaddafi’s forces in Libya, of which he said in an interview with the Boston Globe, “You don’t want to be defined as that guy who got captured in 2011... believe that front-line journalism is important.” He spoke at Northwestern University about his experience in Libya.

She was then given meat, rice and soup.

He continued: ‘But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said “You’ve just eaten him”.’

It is believed the injury is a direct result of his excessive weight. The North Korean ruler is believed to weigh over 20 stone, reportedly due to his heavy drinking and an overindulgence in Swiss cheese.

""Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,"" an anonymous source was quoted as saying in the Chosun Ilbo, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The images, which cannot be independently verified, show a young boy believed to be about 10-years-old holding guns, posing with a balaclava stretched across his face and standing alongside a man thought to be his father who is reportedly a militant.

Those sharing the pictures are paying tribute to the child on Twitter as the youngest martyr from the Arabian Peninsula to have been killed in Syria as Isis tries to establish a caliphate across swathes of the region, according to Charlie Cooper, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation.

Mr Cooper said the images have been circulated on social media with hashtags translated as 'martyrdom of the cub of Baghdadi and his father'. It is claimed that reports of his death first emerged on 26 September and that he was killed fighting alongside his father.

The child's alleged death comes after an Australian man fighting for Isis posted a picture online showing his young son holding the severed head of a Syrian soldier in August, with the caption: ""That's my boy.""

In the same month, a report by the United Nations Human Rights Council found Isis affiliated groups have recruited, trained and used children in active combat roles.

It also found Isis has established training camps to recruit children into armed roles, where they would receive weapons training and religious education. In Raqqa, children as young as ten were being recruited and trained by Isis.

He and the other living founding members of legendary hard-rock band Led Zeppelin were about to ink an $800 million contract with Virgin Atlantic billionaire Richard Branson to play a reunion tour, but the iconic band’s singer ripped the contract to shreds in the final moments, a report said.
Founding members Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones signed on immediately when the flamboyant investor offered the Rock and Roll Hall of Famers the staggering amount to perform just 35 tour dates in three locations including London, Berlin and New Jersey, according to the UK’s Mirror.
But Branson was left stunned when the 66-year-old Plant tore the agreement to pieces right in front of the concert promoters, the newspaper said.
“There was an enormous sense of shock,” a source told the Mirror. “He said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given.”
Guitarist Page and bassist Jones were all set to perform along with drummer Jason Bonham, who has filled in for his late father, John Bonham, in the past.
They gave their cranky frontman two days to think about the historic reunion, and he turned into a real heartbreaker for fans who have dreamed of another reunion tour.
“It was a no-brainer for them, but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it,” the source said. “They have tried to talk him ’round, but there is no chance. His mind is made up and that’s that.”
And it’s not likely that the band can hire a replacement for Plant’s unique voice.
“There is no way they can go ahead without him,” the source said.
Branson, a tremendous fan of the ’70s rock band, reportedly pulled out all the stops to get the “The Song Remains the Same” rockers back on stage together.
The founder of Virgin Group was planning on renaming one of his jumbo jets “The Starship” and having the craft ferry the stars around to their gigs.
He was even going to have the staircase of the jet renamed the Stairway to Heaven after the band’s landmark hit.
“Even his money was not enough to get Plant to sign up,” the source said, adding that the tycoon was very upset by the singer’s diss.
The band last played together, with Jason Bonham filling in on drums, during a tribute concert at London’s O2 arena in 2007.

I'm not going to dignify the terrorists by posting the video here, you can look it up on your own if you'd like. A warning, extremely violent and difficult to watch. 

Wright's fellow journalist Ihan Tanir gave some background on the situation on Twitter.

More from Noah Rothman:

The American photojournalist James Wright Foley was working for Agence France Presse when he was captured crossing the Syria-Turkish border in 2012. The American war reporter had previously been held for six weeks by pro-Gaddafi forces in Libya while covering that conflict. Some believed that his capture would be similarly short-lived. Tragically, that would not be the case.

“On November 22, 2012, James Wright Foley, a freelance photo journalist, was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria,” the FBI noted in November, 2012. “Foley had employed a translator to help him travel across the Syrian-Turkish border. The translator was also taken, but later released.”
Swift justice is in order. Immediately. May his family find peace in this extremely difficult time. 

Meanwhile the JV terror team, I mean ISIS, is threatening to kill American journalist Steven Sotloff next.

247,More than 200 kidnapped Nigerian girls to be released after deal reached with Boko Haram,"A year before North Korean leader Kim Jong-un came to power, a directive was issued for anyone sharing his name to change it – maintaining a tradition upheld by the reclusive state’s ruling Kim dynasty, a report said.

An internal state document obtained by South Korea’s KBS TV station contains an “administrative order” from then leader Kim Jong-il for all party, army and police officials to ensure the directive was carried out. The order was issued in January 2011, shortly after Kim Jong-un had been anointed as his father’s successor. Kim Jong-il died in December of the same year.

“All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-un … and train them to voluntarily change their names,” said the document, extracts of which were aired by KBS on Tuesday.

The process involved revising names on official documents, including social security cards and school diplomas. Officials were also directed to reject birth certificates for any newborns named Kim Jong-un.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip … regarding this project,” it added.

The authenticity of the official directive could not be independently verified, and Seoul’s unification ministry declined to comment on whether it was genuine.

But one government official noted that the Pyongyang regime was known to have banned citizens sharing the names of founding president Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il.

“Given the North maintained the policy under the two previous leaders, there is a possibility that it would continue to do so now,” the official said.

The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea for more than six decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult.

Park Jin-hee, a North Korean defector working for KBS who obtained the document, said she was sure the 2011 directive had been effectively enforced.

“There is no one in the North named Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-un,” Park, who defected in 2008, said.",unrelated

Animals treated at Toll Barn vets', North Walsham

Photo gallery

Vet Faye Bethell used tiny instruments to remove one lump close to the fish’s anus, and another from its dorsal fin.

The fish-lover had taken the sick, three-inch pet for a consultation at North Walsham’s Toll Barn Veterinary Centre, according to Miss Bethell, 29.

At first he had baulked at the price quoted for the treatment and went away. But he had returned five minutes later and asked for it to go ahead.

Goldfish, which can be bought for less than £3 each, can live up to 10 years. The ailing fish, which has made a full recovery, was two years and 10 months old at the time of its operation.

Fishy facts
■ Goldfish, which can be bought for less than £3 each, can live up to 10 years.

■ Goldfish have a memory-span of at least three months.

■ Goldfish can grow more than a foot long, but can be stunted by being kept in tanks too small for them and where the water quality is poor.

■ Goldfish have no eyelids, so they have to sleep with their eyes open.

■ Goldfish have been kept as pets for more than 2,000 years.

■ The collective noun for goldfish is a “glint” or a “troubling”.

The delicate procedure, which lasted about 50 minutes, involved introducing a carefully-measured anaesthetising agent into the fish’s water.

As it lost its balance, it was removed from its tank and placed on a waterproof drape. The anaesthetic water was then introduced into its mouth via a tube and bubbled over its gills, through which it breathes.

Using a miniature heart-rate monitor, Miss Bethell checked that the fish was properly “under” before using a mini scalpel to remove the lumps.

She then sewed each cut with three stitches, finally using a special “glue” to cover and waterproof the fish’s scales before it was gradually re-awakened.

Working with some weird and wonderful creatures
Taking lumps off goldfish is all in a day’s work for vet Faye Bethell, who spent one morning this week castrating a skunk.

Cadbury, the chocolate skunk, had been brought in for the snip by his Scratby Garden Centre owners.

Since opening Toll Barn vets’ a year ago, specialising in exotics, Miss Bethell has performed a varied range of operations. They include:

■ removing a skin tumour from a two-inch long hognose snake, which weighed just 12g;

■ taking out a stone from the 5mm-wide ureter of a guinea pig, at a cost of about £600, including post-op care;

■ treating sugar gliders (a gliding possum) for a poor diet, and a degu (a large rat-like rodent) for diabetes;

■ removing an air-rifle pellet from a Mundesley cat, discovered lodged under its skin during its routine booster jab check;

■ working with wildlife rescue groups to save an injured sparrowhawk. Miss Bethell pinned its broken wing. It has since been successfully released into the wild;

■ spending Boxing Day operating to remove a corn on the cob, which had got trapped in a dog’s intestines, as well as making a puppy vomit after it had eaten its owner’s pills.

“There was nothing special about the fish. He just liked it a lot. People love their pets – but that was an expensive little goldfish,” said Miss Bethell, who spent Tuesday morning castrating Cadbury the skunk.

The Toll Barn practice opened a year ago and specialises in exotic animals, as well as the more usual pets.

The past 12 months have also seen Miss Bethell remove a skin tumour from a two-inch long hognose snake which weighed just 12g.

She has successfully taken out a stone from the 5mm-wide ureter of a guinea pig, at a cost of about £600, including post-op care.

Sugar gliders (a gliding possum) have been treated for a poor diet, a degu (a large rat-like rodent) for diabetes and a cat from Mundesley, which was being examined as part of its annual booster jab check, was discovered to have been shot by an air-gun pellet, which she operated to remove.

She also recently helped wildlife rescue groups save an injured sparrow hawk by pinning a broken wing, so that it could recover and be released.

“It’s been an absolutely brilliant year with lovely clients and lovely animals,” said Miss Bethell, who spent Boxing Day operating to remove a corn on the cob which had got trapped in a dog’s intestines, as well as making a puppy vomit after it had eaten its mistress’ pills.

“It’s exceeded my expectations,” she added.

“I can’t believe the variety we have had.”",unrelated
249,Apple in talks to become launch partner for cable-free HBO Now service,"Militants with the Islamic State jihadi group have released a video that appears to show the beheading of a British hostage, David Haines, an aid worker who was captured just days after he arrived in Syria last year.

British government officials were seeking to authenticate the video which purported to show the final moments of Haines, who was 44.

In the video, entitled A Message to the Allies of America, a masked man is shown carrying out the beheading of Haines, whose life had earlier been threatened in a film showing the murder of American journalist Steven Sotloff. The video, which runs to two minutes and 28 seconds, ends with a warning that a second British hostage would be the next to die. He has been named in international media and on social media as Alan Henning, a British aid worker.

Haines is the third western hostage and the first Briton to be killed in this fashion by Isis – the first, US journalist James Foley, was murdered in a video released on 19 August.

The British prime minister, David Cameron, issued a statement denouncing the killing. “This is a despicable and appalling murder of an innocent aid worker. It is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal.

“We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.”

Cameron will gather senior representatives of the military and security services and the Foreign Office and Home Office in Whitehall to discuss the situation.

The US president, Barack Obama, also condemned the killing. “The United States strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group Isil,” he said, using his administration’s preferred acronym for Isis. “Our hearts go out to the family of Mr Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom.

“The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve. We will work with the UK and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world.”

The recording features a voiceover delivered by an Isis militant, whose voice and accent closely resembles that of the killer in both the Sotloff and Foley videos. The killer directly addresses Cameron, saying that Haines “has to pay the price for your promise” to arm Kurdish peshmerga fighters against Isis.

Speaking to the camera, the hostage, composed but clearly under duress, and wearing an orange jumpsuit, reads out a statement in which he says that Cameron is “entirely responsible for my execution” for entering into a coalition with the US.

Haines, who was in the Royal Air Force for 12 years before moving into aid work, addresses Cameron, saying: “You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State, just as your predecessor, Tony Blair, did, following a trend amongst our British prime ministers who can’t find the courage to say no to the Americans.

“Unfortunately, it is we, the British public, that will in the end pay the price for our parliament’s selfish decisions.”

The killer, swathed in black, then makes a statement in which he makes a direct reference to the British government’s aid to Kurdish fighters.

He says: “This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State. Ironically, he has spent a decade of his life serving under the same Royal Air Force that is responsible for delivering those arms.

“Your evil alliance with America which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha dam will only accelerate your destruction. And playing the role of the obedient lapdog, Cameron, will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war.”

At the end of the latest video, another hostage, Henning, is paraded.

The US carried out at least nine air strikes last week on Isis militants threatening the Haditha dam. The bombing was cited by Haines’s killer in the video.

A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office in London said: “We are aware of the video and are working urgently to verify the contents.”

Isis had threatened to kill Haines, a father of two, in a video that emerged 11 days ago in which Sotloff was murdered. Less than 24 hours before the latest video emerged, the Haines family had made a plea to the jihadis to respond to their efforts to make contact.

The family statement, which was released by the Foreign Office and addressed the militants directly, said: “We are the family of David Haines. We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.”

Haines was born in East Yorkshire but raised in Perthshire, and before his capture was living in Croatia with his second wife Dragana.

He had a 17-year-old daughter with his first wife Louise, and a four-year-old daughter with Dragana, who has described him as a “fantastic man and father”. He was kidnapped while working for the aid organisation Acted, having previously worked in Libya and South Sudan.

A meeting of the British government’s emergency committee, Cobra, is expected to be called imminently and the prime minister’s attentions will be diverted from the referendum on Scottish independence, due to take place on Thursday.

Haines had worked for aid agencies in some of the world’s worst trouble spots, including Libya and South Sudan.

He was in Libya during its civil war in 2011, working as head of mission for Handicap International, which helps disabled people in poverty and conflict zones around the world.",unrelated
250,Boko Haram 'ceasefire' doubts after attacks reported in Nigeria,"Claim: Eleven passenger planes are missing from an airport in Libya.

PROBABLY FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, September 2014]

Seeking truth in stir of 11 missing / stolen commercial airliners from the Libyan airport during the fall of Tripoli.

Origins: In early August 2014, some North African bloggers began to spread stories that several commercial airliners were missing from the Tripoli International Airport during or shortly after the facility was taken over by Zintan militia forces earlier in the summer. Later that month translations of the blog posts began to be picked up by news outlets in Western Europe and passed on as fact rather than gossip; by early September those tales of translations of blogs had spread to the United States under the guise of real news.

The use of airplanes as terrorist weapons in 2001 makes it all too easy for us to anticipate their being used that way again. And despite denials from all sides — the airlines who are not missing any planes, the Libyan transport ministry, and the anti-government forces in control of the airport — the tales have found a ready audience among a populace already on edge in anticipation of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

However, there have been no statements from the State Department, the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, or any other authority warning of stolen airliners. The national threat level has not been raised. Algerian and Moroccan military and air defense, already on high alert due to the unrest just across their borders with Libya, would undoubtedly have noticed multiple flights of unidentified passenger aircraft.

251,Passenger Wears A Hazmat Suit To Dulles Airport,"Sorry to disappoint, fans of Led Zeppelin, but it doesn’t look like a reunion will be happening any time soon.

According to a report from UK publication The Mirror, the group’s famed lead singer Robert Plant literally tore up a contract to reunite the band worth almost $800 million, saying the timing just wasn’t right for a reunion tour.

Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin brand fame was apparently behind the entire thing, offering the band an obscene amount of money just to reunite for a few dozen shows. The contract was reportedly for 35 shows in three cities: London, Berlin, and an unnamed location in New Jersey. Each of the three remaining original members would have earned somewhere over $200 million each just for performing, while another $100 million in merchandising profits was to be shared between the group members.

English: Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin

Branson was reportedly also ready to supply the group with their own private jet for the tour. The mogul was prepared to take one of his airline’s planes and rebrand it “The Starship”. The contract also had an extension option to add 45 more shows in additional venues should the band agree.

The other two original members of the group apparently signed on immediately, and Jason Bonham, the son of late drummer John Bonham, was set to step in for his father. Plant apparently met with conert promoters to discuss the deal, and during the meeting actually ripped the contract in two, ending any chance of a regrouping.


While $800 million is certainly a lot of money, it’s not like Robert Plant (or any of the other members for that matter) really need it. Led Zeppelin are one of the most successful groups of all time, having sold around 112 million records in the United States alone (that figure is three or four times that when the entire planet is counted). In fact, they are the fourth best-selling music act in American history, right behind The Beatles, Elvis Presley, and Garth Brooks.

Robert Plant has also had an incredibly successful career outside of Led Zeppelin. He has released fourteen albums, selling additional millions and making his chart history that much more impressive. His collaborative album Raising Sand with bluegrass/country singer Alison Krauss may not have been his most commercially successful, but it was adored universally by critics, and won he, Alison, and producer T-Bone Burnett five Grammys back in 2009, including Record of the Year and Album of the Year.

While the band’s last album of original music, Coda, was released back in 1982, the band has continued to sell well throughout the years, making millions in repackagings, reissues and live album releases. The group’s last show together was in London back in December of 2007, which was a tribute to legendary music executive Ahmet Ertegün. The concert is thought to have had the most-desired tickets of any show in history, as when it was announced, 20 million requests were submitted online for passes.",unrelated
252,Eggnog-chugging contest leads to hospital stay,"BEIRUT — Islamic State group fighters seized at least one cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town, activists said Tuesday.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

The caches were airdropped early on Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobani that lies near the Turkish border. The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

On Tuesday, IS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said ""Team USA.""

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said the U.S. had seen the video but couldn't confirm its accuracy and was seeking more information.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.",unrelated

254,Taliban member swapped by Obama for Bowe Bergdahl tried to return to terror: report,"KFC: Marijuana on the menu? Not likely. A story that began circulating on Tuesday afternoon created a bit of a frenzy, but the fact is, there’s no sign KFC will really be selling marijuana in its stores.

The story began at the Racket Report, where it was announced that marijuana profits were hitting such high levels that the fast food restaurant chain had decided to get in on the game. While the idea may appeal to pot lovers who think they can get the munchies and a bucket full of munchables in a single stop, there are a few problems.

First and foremost, Racket Report appears to be a mostly satirical website, carrying multiple stories, such as the Fetal Ink Syndrome story, that have been debunked by fact-checking site Snopes. (Here‘s Snopes debunking the Fetal Ink Syndrome tale.)

KFC also doesn’t mention any marijuana sales on its official news page — a thing you’d think they’d mention if they were hoping to drum up sales.

Another concern is banking. While marijuana shops were assured early in 2014 that they could have access to banks, many report still having difficulties. Though the original story claims that KFC’s pot sales will be cash only, in order to protect the restaurant’s funds, this would be no protection.

If marijuana sales are understood to be federally illegal (a question that is in limbo at the moment, with government officials calling on law enforcement to make pot arrests a very low priority, but laws still on the books) then no funds collected by a facility could reasonably be protected. That is, if the government elected to seize funds illegally procured, they could still freeze bank accounts and seize the contents — even if all illegal dealings were handled in cash.

This could not only be a concern for KFC, but for its parent company, YUM Brands.

Notably, a KFC turned into a marijuana dispensary is a plot point in a South park episode, and there is another KFC that does indeed sell marijuana — but it’s not the fried chicken chain. Instead, it’s a shop called Kind For Cures, a California pot shop based on that same South Park episode, that assures on its website, “This ain’t no chicken joint!”

Calls to YUM Brands and to KFC Tuesday evening were not immediately returned, but there are no signs that KFC marijuana will be available in the bucket next to your extra crispy any time soon.

255,Obama: murder of James Foley 'shocks the conscience of the entire world',"KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Kansas City health officials said a man held in isolation at a local hospital over the weekend was not infected with the Ebola virus. Officials hope to sooth nerves as fears about the deadly virus spread across the country, even though the virus itself has not.

“We have ruled out any Ebola case in Kansas City,” Kansas City Health Department Director Dr. Rex Archer told reporters on Monday. He said the man, who had recently traveled to Nigeria, did not possess the symptom profile for the deadly virus beyond a high fever and had not been in direct contact with anyone who had the disease during his travels.

No Ebola blood test was done, Dr. Archer said, because the feared symptoms never materialized.

The case marked the second known Ebola scare in the Kansas City area , as fears of the virus have built while an American fights for his life against it in Dallas.

At the White House Monday, President Barack Obama urged calm and outlined several steps the administration is taking to contain the virus in Africa and fight it there.

“The CDC is familiar with dealing with infectious diseases and viruses like this,” the president said. “We know what has to be done, and we have the medical infrastructure to do it.”

Monday morning, Kansas Senator Jerry Moran sent a letter to the CDC director , urging greater screening at U.S. ports of entry, including airports.

This afternoon, President Obama said such steps are under consideration.

“We're also going to be looking at protocols to do additional passenger screening both at the source and here in the United States,” Obama said. “All of these things make me confident that here in the United States, the chances of an outbreak-of an epidemic here- are extraordinarily low.”",unrelated

Mosul is held by ISIS; Al-Sabah is the official Iraqi government newspaper.

Mashable reports that the story, which originated in Al-Sabah, has spread amongst other pro-government and Kurdish newspapers. Like a virus! Might such outlets have an interest in encouraging the notion that ISIS fighters were stricken with highly-stigmatized diseases? Hmm.

Meanwhile, Forbes reported in October that ISIS maybe possibly could use Ebola as a weapon:

Then again, ""We've seen no specific credible intelligence that [ISIS] is attempting to use any sort of disease or virus to attack our homeland,"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in October.

A 20-year-old burger, a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese, looks pretty much the same as a new Quarter Pounder looks today!

It became a joke over the next few weeks when the friend still hadn’t claimed the burger, the buddies told him they'd keep it safe for him. Then that ran into months and now decades later, the Quarter Pounder is unwrapped and shared on a local news show. The two Australian buddies, Casey Dean and Eduard Nitz, were only 14 and 13 at the time they purchased the Quarter Pounder with Cheese for their friend.

According to the Sidney Daily Telegraph, Dean states that he is pretty sure that this burger is the oldest burger in the world. While folk’s might store wine to age for 20 years, ground beef is not something you would eat after being left out a few hours, never mind decades.

Dean and Nitz recently appeared on the TV show “The Project” with their antiquated McDonald’s Quarter Pounder and it didn’t look as one might expect a 20-year-old burger to look like. The burger and bread didn’t sport any mold, discoloration or even a bad smell. It looked almost identical to a McDonald's burger just purchased today.

This Quarter Pounder has now taken on a life of its own with a new Facebook page that asks, ""Can This Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?"" It got 3000 likes in just the first day it materialized.

The two Aussie buddies were about to take a bite of the very old burger in the name of charity, but the show’s host prompted them to put it down and skip this decades-old offering. The host protested and shared some common sense with the two friends and they obliged.

If the two buddies had eaten the old burger, chances are they would later break out in a fight as to who would use the bathroom first! They would most likely spend the remainder of the day hanging around the toilet bowl from eating meat that is so old.",unrelated

259,Christian Bale won't play Steve Jobs,"Cristian Bale is eyeing — or i-ing, if you prefer — the role of Apple founder Steve Jobs.

The 40-year-old English actor is in talks to play the charismatic tech genius who gave the world the iMac, the iPod and the iPhone in Sony's upcoming biopic, The Times has confirmed. The Hollywood Reporter broke the news.

Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire,"" ""Trainspotting"") is directing the film, which may be called ""Jobs,"" from a script by Aaron Sorkin, who won a screenwriting Oscar for the Facebook drama ""The Social Network"" (released by Sony in 2010). Sorkin's screenplay is based on Walter Isaacson's bestselling biography ""Steve Jobs,"" acquired by Sony around the time of Jobs' death in October 2011.

The film has had a few twists and turns: Leonardo DiCaprio previously circled the Jobs role but ultimately passed, and ""Gone Girl"" director David Fincher was in talks to helm the film at one point.

Even with Bale, the Jobs biopic still faces questions, particularly over whether audiences will continue to be fascinated by Jobs. While no doubt a towering, relevant figure in both technology and culture, those two areas are characterized by swiftly moving currents, and it remains to be seen where mass interest lies when the film eventually comes out.

Rather than take a traditional cradle-to-grave approach, Sorkin said at a 2012 Newsweek and Daily Beast event that the ""entire movie is going to be three scenes, and three scenes only, that all take place in real time."" He added, ""Each of these three scenes is going to take place before a product launch — backstage before a product launch.

Smiling: Describing the child as ISIS' youngest foreign jihadist, chilling photographs taken before his alleged death show him grinning at the camera, wearing military fatigues and brandishing a huge assault rifle

Last week a 24-year-old Muslim convert admitted taking her infant son to live among Islamic State terrorists in the Syrian city of Raqqa because she believes he will lead a 'better life' under their brutal regime.

Asiya Ummi Abdullah denied that children are unhappy living under the oppressive rule of ISIS' religious fanatics and explained that she felt her three-year-old son's spiritual well-being was better served in the group's de facto capital, where public crucifixions and beheadings are commonplace.

Ummi Abduallah - who had lived in Turkey since her teens but was born in Kyrgyzstan - said moving to the militant stronghold in Syria was in part to shield the young boy from the sex, crime, drugs and alcohol she sees as rampant in her home town Istanbul.

'Who says children here are unhappy?... He will know God and live under his rules,' she said.

Dramatic footage has emerged from inside Kobane showing brave Kurdish fighters battling against militants from the Islamic State.

The clip, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, shows resistance forces from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) firing assault rifles and machine guns mounted on the back of a car at militants hiding behind buildings in the Kobane suburbs.

The terrorists launched a renewed assault on Kobane last night, killing dozens of Kurds who have resisted ISIS' advances into the city's suburbs over the last three weeks.

Prepared: A Kurdish fighter takes up his position to fight the Islamic State jihadists

Islamic State militants are now in control of one third of the besieged Syrian city of Kobane despite three days of American airstrikes, a group monitoring violence in the country said today.

This morning the chilling sight of the group's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes.

While the airstrikes appear to have slowed the militants advance in some areas of the city, ISIS fighters appear to be creeping ever closer to the centre of Kobane, where thousands of civilians unable or unwilling to flee their homes face rape and massacre.

News of ISIS' gains came as the Pentagon admitted airstrikes alone will not be enough to prevent the fall of Kobane, raising serious questions over the U.S.'s wider campaign against the terror group.

Dramatic: The escalation in Kobane has seen the U.S. and Arab coalition carry out the most sustained period of bombing raids since their campaign to destroy the Islamic State in northern Syria started two weeks ago

Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said airstrikes are 'not going to be enough to save that city', amid growing concern that without Western ground troops being sent into Syria, the defeat of ISIS will prove a near impossible task.

Heavily outgunned Kurdish defenders said Islamic State militants had pushed into two districts of Kobane - a mainly Kurdish border city with 40,000 residents - by late last night.

Washington said the U.S. military and Arab partner nations responded to ISIS renewed assault by carrying out eight air strikes last night, adding that for now the city remains under Kurdish control.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights this morning said that despite overnight airstrikes, which have continued into this morning, Islamic State fighters managed to capture a police station in the east of Kobane and now control one third of the city.",unrelated

But according to reporters who were on the ground as well as the information director at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, that was not the case.

“Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred,” Nail al-Jubeir told Bloomberg View’s Josh Rogin in an emailed statement.

Additionally, CNN’s Hala Gorani said her colleague Nic Robertson saw the first lady’s non-blurred image on Saudi TV himself:

262,6 Islamist militants killed in US attack in Somalia,"The leaked video of Georgy Myakinkin's protest against heavy-handed security guards at Pulkovo Airport in St Petersburg, Russia, has gone viral

This is the moment an airport worker protested against 'rough' security guards - by stripping NAKED and walking through the scanner in just his socks.

Georgy Myakinkin, 31, left his keys at work following his shift at Pulkovo Airport in St Petersburg, Russia.

When he returned to collect them, he says ""heavy-handed"" security guards stopped him 'unnecessarily' and told him he had to remove his belt.

Staging an impromptu protest, he then stripped naked - apart from his socks - before sauntering through the scanner, leaving the guards gobsmacked.

CEN   Bare cheek: Down come the trousers

He said: ""I returned to the airport and was just in the section where trains arrive with passengers when I was stopped and asked to remove my belt before going through a scanner.

""I know the rules and I know that it isn't necessary here in the pre-flight area to be so strict - security guards were just being heavy-handed.

""When I refused and told them I wanted to just get my keys, they called police.""

CEN   Strip-gate: But he left socks on before passing through

Georgy whipped off his clothes and walked through the scanner. The speechless officers then allowed him to dress and leave.

But when he turned up for work the next day, he discovered that the CCTV security camera video had been leaked and gone viral.

The Russian Interior Ministry's transport department in the Northwestern Federal District said it is currently investigating the alleged breach of security.

CEN   Viral: He retrieves watch in video which was leaked

A spokesman said: ""We are looking into the matter and have nothing more to say at this moment.""

Georgy has filed a complaint against police over the leaked video.

He said: ""I know that they just leaked it in order to embarrass me, but I will have the last laugh.""

263,This Letter To Parents From A 1970s Lego Set Contains An Important Message For Gender Equality,"We’ve all had jobs we absolutely can’t stand, and thanks to the Internet we’ve seen many examples of people quitting their jobs in amazing ways. A video popped up on YouTube today that appears to add yet another thread to this growing trend, as a “secret ending” to a not-at-all-popular smartphone game called Electric Boogie. The video shows a message from the game’s lead developer to his boss, and the language isn’t exactly kind.

“Working for you is a living hell,” the message reads. “You have your head so far up your ass, it’s no wonder why your breath always smells like shit. Consider this cartoon animation and this letter, my resignation from your pathetic company. I quit.” Adding “P.S. Your game fucking sucks.”

The note is signed “D.B.G 08/11/14” which would seem to credit it to a gameplay programmer named David Gordon, though Mr. Gordon’s name still appears on the website of developer TriplePlay Apps. If he did indeed quit in August, David Gordon is quite the trooper for remaining with the team a full four months later. (Or they're incredibly bad at updating the site.)

Then there’s the matter of the game’s marketing, which thus far has consisted of poorly conceived attempts at creating some viral buzz, all of which have fallen completely flat. For example, an Imgur gallery of horrible Electric Boogie parody movie posters had been submitted to several different subreddits before most of the links were eventually deleted.

The official YouTube account of TriplePlay Apps doesn’t seem to take the game itself too seriously either, intentionally slamming it as “terrible” and “the worst game ever.” This stands in stark contrast to the Electric Boogie page on the TriplePlay Apps website, where they praise the game. Why would the developers of the game trash it on YouTube? It’s all very strange and seems to suggest a desperation to create buzz, even in a so-bad-its-good way, though none of it ever caught on.

TriplePlay Apps itself is a bit of a mystery as well, as the company—if we can even call it that—has absolutely zero history of iOS apps of any kind, and very few on Google Play. In fact, Electric Boogie was published under the name Qbical LLC, which is also based out of Denton, Tex., the same city where TriplePlay Apps is supposedly located.

A Google search of any of the names associated with the company, from the CEO to the disgruntled David Gordon, returns absolutely nothing. Not a single Twitter account, Facebook page, or—and this is the best part—a single credible image on any website, including those associated with either of these “companies.”

In fact, I’m not even sure if TriplePlay Apps, Qbical LLC, or whatever you want to call the person or persons who published Electric Boogie even has an office at all. Qbical LLC is listed as a “Home Business” in a couple of smaller online business directories, with a single address. TriplePlay Apps uses this image on its website next to “Our Company”:

TriplePlay Apps

Google Maps

In the video he says he stumbled upon the game, began playing, and discovered this “secret ending,” but his YouTube history calls that into question. Not only did he view and “Like” the Electric Boogie trailer over a week before publishing his own video, he published a clip 10 months ago for a game called Flappy Beard. The video he published resides only on his account, so he presumably had some sort of involvement in the app or the creation of the video itself, and if you follow Flappy Beard back to the Google Play Store you’ll see that the app was published by—you guessed it—TriplePlay Apps.

265,"Islamic State Training Pilots in Military Jets, Monitors Say","Militants reportedly have three captured jets and witnesses cited as saying they have seen planes flying low over Aleppo

Islamic State (Isis) is takings its first steps towards building an air force by training pilots to fly captured fighter planes, according to a group monitoring the conflict in Syria.

Isis is using lots of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, artillery and Jeeps taken from the Syrian and Iraqi armies but this is the first report that it has planes in the air.

Isis, which took the US by surprise this year with its rapid territorial expansion in Syria and Iraq, has three Russian-built MiG jets, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), which appears to have a good network of observers on the ground and has often proved reliable in the past.

Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the British-based group, said Isis has trainers who had gained experience in the Iraqi air force under former president Saddam Hussein.

Abdulrahman cited witnesses who had seen the planes flying low over Aleppo, in rebel-held northern Syria.

If Isis was able to train pilots, they could mount 9/11-style suicide attacks on key installations in Damascus or Baghdad.

Defence analysts said that while this is feasible, they were extremely sceptical. “There is a small chance but not a big chance,” said Afzal Ashraf, a former RAF captain, counter-terrorism specialist and consultant at the London-based Royal United Services Institute(Rusi).

It was feasible to train pilots for small aircraft but it would be a struggle to do the same with an advanced fighter jet. Such jets would require frequent maintenance as well as a good navigation system and air traffic control, Ashraf said.

Such planes could be easily picked off by US, UK, Turkish or even Syrian planes or air defences. The UK is flying reconnaissance and bombing missions only over Iraq while the US is engaged in both Iraq and Syria.

In February last year, the SOHR reported the capture of the al-Jarrah military airport near Aleppo, which had been held by Assad’s forces. The MiG fighters were said to have been taken at the time.

The monitoring group reported witnesses saying the planes flying low over Aleppo recently appeared to be MiG 21s or MiG 23s and had taken off from and returned to the nearby al-Jarrah base. It added that training courses are taking place at the base.

The SOHR said it did not know whether the planes were armed with missiles.

Isis has taken swathes of Sunni-dominated territory in Iraq and is on the outskirts of Baghdad.

Raffaello Pantucci, a counter-terrorist specialist at Rusi, said he had seen footage of captured planes and questioned their viability. “They were covered in bird shit,” he said.

Pantucci said they would pose no problem for the sophisticated air defence capabilities of the US and its Nato ally Turkey, and even to a lesser extent those of Syria’s President Bashar-al-Assad.

Ashraf said of the former Iraqi air force pilots reported to have joined Isis that it would be hard for them to keep up with the latest advances. “Flying is a very perishable skill,” he said.

He predicted they were almost certain to crash. “You have to be able to fly and to take off and to navigate. If you do not know what you are doing, you are likely to stall it,” Ashraf said.",discuss
266,Could Kim Jong Un open a restaurant in Scotland?,"U.S. officials suspect that one of the five Taliban detainees released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has attempted to return to terrorism, CNN reported Thursday.

The former prisoner, being held in Qatar, is believed to have tried to make contact with Taliban associates in Afghanistan, officials told CNN.

NBC News reported that it’s unknown whether the man actually connected with the Taliban or if it was a true effort to actually rejoin militants. The name of the former detainee has not been disclosed.

From CNN:

[A]n ongoing U.S. intelligence program to secretly intercept and monitor all of their communications in Qatar turned up evidence in recent months that one of them has “reached out” to try to encourage militant activity, one official said. The official would offer no further details.

Under current law, this act placed the man in the category of being “suspected” of re-engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities. However, several officials say there is now a debate inside the administration that the intelligence may be stronger than the “suspected” classification. Some elements of the intelligence community believe the information is strong enough to classify the man as “confirmed” for returning to illegal activities. All five men are having their communications even more closely monitored right now, but the belief is there is no current threat, one official told CNN.

“We’re closely monitoring the situation and see no potential threat,” an official told NBC.

The prisoner swap, which occurred in May, drew ire from lawmakers who said the Obama administration broke federal law by not first informing Congress.

Bergdahl was back in the news this week with reports that the Army was preparing to charge him with desertion after he disappeared from his Afghanistan post in 2009 and was held in captivity for five years. The Army denied that any decision on charges had been made.",unrelated

Cupertino has been quiet thus far, but rumors are swirling about a 12-inch MacBook Air refresh, and this isn’t just a spec bump. Apple is reportedly redesigning the iconic laptop to be even thinner with a higher resolution screen.
Sources inside the company who have used the prototype notebook (code named MacBook Stealth) say it will eschew many of the conventional laptop features in the name of advancing design. The current MacBook Air’s taper toward the front edge, which gives them a very slim profile, but there’s still space near the back for the power connector and full-sized USBs. The new Air, however, won’t be thick enough for a USB port. Instead, Apple will start using the new type-c reversible connectors. There also won’t be an SD card slot or a MagSafe power connector–even Apple’s beloved Thunderbolt is taking a hike. USB will do it all.
MBA
The 12-inch laptop would be substantially smaller and lighter than the 13-inch model, and even slightly smaller than the 11-inch version. This is thanks to slimmer bezels and a slightly more compact keyboard with less separate between keys. 9to5Mac doesn’t have details on exactly how high the resolution will be, but the current Airs are sitting at 1366 x 768 (11-inch) and 1440 x 900 (13-inch). Stepping it up to a Retina Display resolution of 2560 x 1600 (like the 13-inch Pro) would be amazing in the Air’s form factor.

To be clear, all the images of this supposed notebook are renders created by 9to5Mac. This is still thoroughly in the rumor category, but it’s a redesign we’ve been expecting for a long time. The updated MacBook Air could be announced in mid-2015.

Lucy Somers said she learned of her brother's death from the FBI. ""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"" she said. Lucy Somers gave the comments to the Associated Press.

The claim nonetheless seemed to contradict a statement on the Yemen defense ministry's website carried by Reuters that suggested Luke Somers had been freed following a suspected U.S. drone strike Saturday in Yemen that killed nine alleged al-Qaeda militants.

The drone struck at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, hitting a suspected militant hideout, according to an official who spoke to the AP. The official did not elaborate and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to brief journalists.

There was also no immediate comment from U.S. officials, who rarely discuss their drone campaign in Yemen.

271,Macaulay Culkin dead: Actor is victim of another death hoax,"A newspaper report that Kim Jong-un has been hospitalized for ankle surgery has fuelled new theories about the North Korean leader’s long absence from the public eye.

Kim has not been seen in public in almost a month and missed a session of parliament on Sept. 25 for the first time since coming to power almost three years ago. Since an event with key officials in July, he has been seen walking with a limp. In an unusual acknowledgment last Friday, North Korean state television said he was experiencing “discomfort.”

Details from the Hermit Kingdom on Kim’s state of health are scarce and hard to verify, but the new details reported by the Chosun Ilbo newspaper paint a broader picture of what may have happened to him. Here is what is suspected so far.

Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, photos released by state media show. He is shown below in photos released by the Korean Central News Agency on Oct. 9, 2010, at left, and July 28, 2014, at right:

Kim is believed to be between 5-foot-2 and 5-foot-9, possibly weighing 280 pounds. Chosun Ilbo cited a recent visitor to North Korea (whom it did not identify) as saying that Kim’s weight gain, combined with an intense tour schedule of factories and military bases, as factors in his ankle injury.

Kim cracked bones in his ankles after neglecting an injury sustained during field supervisions in June, the source cited by Chosun Ilbo said. The source said Kim had surgery and is recovering at Bongwha Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members, according to the newspaper.

Surgery to the ankles could be consistent with gout, Alastair Hepburn, a consultant rheumatologist and a Medical Trustee of the U.K. Gout Society. “It’s unusual but it’s possible,” Hepburn said in a telephone interview. Severe gout can damage the joints, making an operation necessary, he said.

North Korea observers speculate Kim’s weight and family background may have contributed to his condition. “Based on his gait, it appears he has gout – something [due to] diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the Kim family,” said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North website.

Gout is a form of arthritis that isn’t fatal, though it can be agonizingly painful. The condition is caused by a buildup of a waste product in the blood called uric acid, which normally is eliminated from the body through urine, according to the U.K.’s National Health Service. Uric acid can cause needle-like crystals to form, which seep into joints and cause inflammation.

“Gout is a very painful and debilitating condition,” said Hepburn of the U.K. Gout Society. “It can lead to a situation when limping becomes obvious because of the pain. A person can be quite well for some time, and then there may be sudden flareups, which cause more pain.”

Chosun Ilbo’s report also said that Kim was believed to be wearing shoes with Cuban heels, a style of two-inch high-heeled men’s footwear, to make him taller and give him a more authoritative appearance. Kim is shown below wearing such shoes in a 2012 appearance with his wife, Ri Sol-ju:",unrelated

Seoul government statistics show Jong Un is the ninth most popular given name in South Korea, where it is often transliterated differently from North Korea's spelling as Jung-eun. A well-known South Korean actress and music talk show host is named Kim Jung-eun.

North Korean state propaganda photos show their leader Kim Jong Un inspecting troops, conferring with generals, meeting an adoring public and even catching a basketball game with former NBA star Dennis Rodman.
The names of the North Korean leader's father and grandfather, Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung, the communist state's founder, were also reserved for their sole use, the media reported.

North Korea's leaders present themselves and their comrades from the ruling Workers' Party as austere revolutionaries but often engage in the same building of personality cults that marked the reigns of their imperial predecessors.


Kim disappeared from the public arena for 40 days this autumn, prompting speculation about a coup d'etat or failing health. He reemerged in mid-October after what sources said was an absence due to surgery to remove a cyst on his ankle.

276,That Boko Haram Ceasefire in Nigeria Isn’t A Ceasefire,"DC Toy Collector is the “highest paid performer” on YouTube making nearly $5 million last year unboxing Disney toys. However, little has been known about the woman-behind-the-hands of the popular YouTube channel. In fact, her face is never shown in the video, only her voice, toys and hands. However, a recent report reveals the true identity of the YouTube hit and the identity is somewhat shocking. A former Brazilian porn star is behind the wholesome Disney videos and it is noted that during the early years of “Disney Collector,” the woman was filming both Disney unboxing videos and porn in the same Florida home.

The Daily Mail reports that Brazilian Daiane DeJeus, also known as Sandy Summers in the porn industry, is the woman behind the hit Disney Collector Youtube videos. Reporters tracked down information on DeJeus that aligns with public records information regarding the widely popular DC Toy Collector YouTube channel. After tracking down DeJeus, the reporters spoke with family and friends who confirmed that Daiane was behind the million dollar videos.

DeJeus has went to unfathomable measures to ensure her identity remained secret and for good reason. The target market of the YouTube channel, which caters to Disney lovers such as children and families, may not remain viewers if they knew the owner’s secret. DeJeus was not only a Disney fanatic, but also a porn star. Going by the name Sandy Summers, Dejeus filmed numerous x-rated videos for the adult film industry in the same home that she filmed some of her early DC Toy Collector features.

Family and friends have identified DeJeus as the mystery unboxer and note that certain physical features on the woman’s hands and arms can be seen in many of the YouTube videos.

“They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.”

Aside from the physical similarities, former neighbors say DeJeus has an unmistakable voice and say that many people on the street knew what she was up to.

‘That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere. Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.”

Would you have ever imagined that the popular DC Toy Collector videos were being filmed in the same house as adult films by a porn star?

An Iraqi official told the Associated Press that the woman detained in Lebanon was not the wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group.
Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maan Ibrahim has clarified that the woman identified as Saja Abdul Hamid al Dulaimi, is an Iraqi national who travelled to Syria before arriving in Lebanon and not the wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The report noted that al-Baghdadi has two wives but neither is named Saja al Dulaimi.

283,"Reports Isis fighters have contracted Ebola are 'incorrect', says Iraqi health ministry","With the threat of an ISIS terror attack becoming ever more real, Iraqi media reported yesterday that some of the group’s militants have contracted the deadly Ebola virus, although World Health Organization officials have yet to confirm the reports.

An International Business Times article from today confirms that three Iraqi news outlets reported that Ebola showed up at a hospital in Mosul, a city 250 miles north of Baghdad which has been under ISIS control since June 2014.

Christy Feig, WHO’s director of communications, casted doubt on the report though, telling reporters, “We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.”

On top of that, it isn’t clear whether any disease experts or doctors in Mosul are even able to test for the Ebola virus. A Kurdish official, who was convinced the cases are Ebola, told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants’ symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus.

Nonetheless, Ebola symptoms, like nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding, are also similar to those associated with a number of other diseases, including malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever viruses, and the Marburg virus.

Iraq’s pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, reported that the disease arrived in Mosul from “terrorists” who came “from several countries” in Africa.

According to a Washington Post report, the majority of the ISIS’ African fighters came from Tunisia, while others came from Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan, and Somalia — none of which reported any Ebola cases in 2014.

Benjamin T. Decker, an intelligence analyst with the Levantine Group, said that over the past few weeks, militants affiliated with ISIS have executed more than a dozen doctors in Mosul.

“U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,” he said.

Decker added, “In this context, the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.”",discuss

Kim Jong-un broke his ankle after he had put on extra weight from regularly consuming imported cheese, said a report on Tuesday.

And the reason for his mysterious disappearance has been finally put to rest when his condition was revealed. He was put to bed after a surgery to fix his fractured ankles.

Uncontrolled daily eating of Emmental, imported from Switzerland, is believed to be responsible for his rapid weight gain, the metro.co.uk reported.

The report citing a South Korean daily said that the tyrant is recovering from the fractured ankles after the strain of his expanding waistline put pressure on a pre-existing injury - and caused the bones to crack.

""I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,"" the South Korean daily Chosun Ilbo quoted a source as saying.

285,New iOS 8 bug can delete all of your iCloud documents,"After a disastrous iOS 8.0.1 rollout and a ton of publicity surrounding Bendgate, saying that Apple had a bad week is an understatement.

Unfortunately for Apple, things aren't looking much better this week, as MacRumors reports on a particularly nasty iOS 8 bug, which could potentially erase the iWork documents stored in your iCloud drive.

According to the report, the option to ""Reset All Settings,"" found under Settings — General — Reset in iOS 8, also deletes documents from the iCloud Drive — permanently.

The option, which normally resets settings to factory defaults, clearly states that ""no data or media will be deleted."" However, after some users on MacRumors' forum complained about the bug, MacRumors tested the option out, and indeed, all the iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive both on the iPhone and on iCloud.com were gone.

Even worse, after iCloud synced with a Mac running OS X Yosemite, the documents were deleted from the Mac as well. Some of the documents — including Preview and TextEdit files — were untouched, but all iWork files seem to be affected.

In some scenarios it's possible to retrieve these files from a backup folder, or via Time Machine, but nothing is certain at this point, and Apple still hasn't publicly acknowledged the bug. For now, iOS 8 users who have iCloud Drive enabled should probably avoid using the ""Reset All Settings"" option.

286,"TEXAS TURKEY FARM CONTAMINATED WITH EBOLA, OVER 250,000 HOLIDAY TURKEYS INFECTED","The sound of 10 or 11 shots from the gun of Ferguson, Mo. police officer Darren Wilson being fired at Michael Brown were recorded by a man in an apartment near the Aug. 9 shooting, according to the man’s attorney who shared the audio with CNN.

The network aired the recording Monday but has not verified its authenticity.

The 12-second audio begins with a man seemingly leaving a message for someone on an adult video service.

Six shots fired in rapid succession are heard in the background. After a two second pause, another four or five shots ring out.

Lopa Blumenthal, the unnamed man’s attorney, told CNN that her client has been interviewed by the FBI.

“At the time he didn’t even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards,” Blumenthal said. “It just happened to have captured twelve seconds of what transpired outside of his building.”

While it is difficult to clearly make out whether 10 or 11 shots are fired, Blumenthal told CNN she believes she heard 11.

Details surrounding the recording are unclear, including why it is emerging over two weeks after the shooting.

It is also unclear at what point the man began recording the message that captured the gun shots. Witnesses as well as law enforcement officials have said that Wilson fired one and perhaps two isolated shots in his police cruiser before numerous shots were fired outside of the car. The new audio seemingly does not capture the one or two shots fired inside Wilson’s cruiser.

Wilson has reportedly claimed that the gun went off in the cruiser during an altercation with Brown in which the 18-year-old shoved him into the car, assaulted him, and struggled to grab the weapon.

After the altercation in the car, witnesses say that Brown fled. From there, Brown’s movements and Wilson’s response are also unclear.

Wilson reportedly claims that after pursuing Brown, the man turned around to face him, taunted him and then began charging before Wilson fired the fatal shots.

Some witnesses say that Wilson began shooting after Brown fled. At that point Brown turned around in order to surrender but Wilson continued firing the fatal shots anyway, the witnesses said.

In a press conference shortly after the shooting, St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar said that Wilson fired “more than just a couple [of shots]” but provided no further detail.

According to a CNN report filed days after the shooting, witnesses claimed that they heard up to 10 shots. Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown’s who was with him during the shooting, told of only a few.

A medical examiner who performed a private autopsy on Brown determined that he was shot at least six times. He had eight wounds on his body, but two may have been re-entry wounds.

It was initially reported that the altercation and shooting followed an argument after Wilson ordered Brown and Johnson to get out of the middle of the road. But it later emerged that Brown had stolen cigars and shoved a store clerk just minutes before he encountered Wilson. Wilson reportedly says that seconds after their first encounter, he received the police dispatch call reporting the strong-arm robbery and then doubled-back to confront the two.

289,Dylan Thomas Finds Tropical Spider Burrowed Under Skin,"A former PGA Tour player claims Tiger Woods has been suspended for one month under the Tour’s anti-doping program.

Dan Olsen, who has made 35 career PGA Tour starts and was an exempt player for the 2004 season, made the claim Friday on radio station WVFN to host David DeMarco.

“I’ve heard that he’s on a month(-long) suspension,” Olsen said, claiming the information came from “exempt Tour players.” Olsen said Woods did not test positive for testosterone but for “something else.”

Olsen continued, “I think when it’s all said and done, he’s going to surpass Lance Armstrong in infamy.”

Woods’ agent Mark Steinberg released a statement to Golf News Net, saying, “These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false. They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.”

PGA Tour media official Joel Schuchmann released a statement on behalf of the Tour, saying, “Regarding the allegations made by Dan Olsen concerning Tiger Woods, there is no truth whatsoever to his claims and the PGA Tour categorically denies them.”

The Michigan-based pro added he believes Woods was faking the back tightness that Woods cited in withdrawing from the Farmers Insurance Open after just 11 holes.

Olsen, whose last PGA Tour start was the 2011 PGA Championship, also made several wild accusations concerning Woods’ golf ball, incorrectly identifying dates during which Woods made changes in the ball he uses. Olsen alluded to comments made by Golf Channel analyst Frank Nobilo concerning the advantage he felt Woods had in 2000 (not 1998 or 1999 as Olsen claimed) in switching to Nike’s first solid-core golf ball. After switch in May 2000, Woods went on to win the final three majors that year, just before Titleist introduced its Pro V1.

Further, Olsen claimed Rory McIlroy wanted out of his Nike contract if he couldn’t have access to the same ball as Woods.

Switching subjects, Olsen also claimed PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem personally visited Dustin Johnson’s home twice in an effort to help the pro with his “personal challenges” before a six-month leave of absence from golf that ended in February. Johnson has disputed a Golf.com report saying he was suspended for that half-year period because of a failed drug test under the Tour’s anti-doping program.",unrelated

295,"ISIS Unleash ""Scorpion"" Bombs In Iraq","A photo provided by the Nicaraguan Army shows an impact crater made by a small meteorite in a wooded area near Managua's international airport. Photo: AP

Managua: A mysterious explosion that rocked Nicaragua's crowded capital Managua, creating a large crater, appears to have been caused by a small meteorite.

Amazingly, in a sprawling city of 1.2 million people, the impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries, but it did leave a crater measuring 12 metres across and was felt throughout the capital late on Saturday night, local time.

Nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed ""2014 RC"", which passed very close to Earth on Sunday and was estimated by astronomers to be about 20 metres wide, or the size of a house.

""We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact,"" said Wilfredo Strauss of the Seismic Institute.

The meteorite appeared to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport around midnight and the hit was so large that it registered on the instruments Dr Strauss's organisation uses to measure earthquakes.

""You can see two waves: first, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth, and then another stronger one, which is the impact of the sound,"" he said.

Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday.

One of them, William Martinez, said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil.

""You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,"" Dr Martinez said.

People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion, and that liquid, sand and dust were blown through the air, which smelled like something had burned.

Nicaragua has more than 20 volcanoes and is regularly shaken by earthquakes, so many locals initially thought a quake caused the loud bang.

There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot, and flights at the airport were not affected.

NASA said last week that the asteroid 2014 RC, at the time of closest approach, would be about one-tenth the distance from the centre of Earth to the moon, or about 40,000 kilometres.

It had been projected to be roughly over New Zealand at the time of its closest approach, which astronomers had calculated would be on Sunday about 1818 GMT (4.18am on Monday AEST).

Yesterday it was reported in The Age that an Australian man had experienced something rather strange and all kinds of horrifying during a trip to Bali. After feeling a “searing sensation” around his abdomen near his old appendix scar, Dylan Thomas from Bunbury in Western Australia says he found out that a spider had crawled into his body through his scar and had made its way right up to his sternum.
""It wasn't really a tickling sensation, obviously once the venom started to affect my skin it was a really burning sensation like a searing feeling,"" he told Radio 6PR.
After a day or two of taking antihistamines, Thomas was feeling worse, and took himself to the hospital. He says the doctors finally found the cause of his discomfort. ""Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that's been living inside of me for the last three days, managed to get it out luckily,"" he told his friends on Facebook, according to Aleisha Orr at The Age.
It sounds pretty far-fetched, and Thomas could well be telling the truth as it was relayed to him at the hospital, but Lauren Davis from io9 spoke to some scientists to get some much-needed perspective.
""I think this is extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible,” arachnid expert Christopher Buddle from McGill University's Department of Natural Resource Sciences told Davis. ""Simply put: it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might 'crawl beneath skin through a scar'. The claim that it was 'feeding and moving up through the scar tissue' defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders. I am also sceptical because the 'evidence' (the spider itself) is not presented.""
The best explanation the scientists Davis spoke to could come up with was that the doctors in Bali pulled something out of Thomas’s body, but it was far more likely to be a tick or a mite. Just not a spider. 
""I have never heard of any spider to crawl or exist under the skin or integument of any other creature (there are no parasites amongst spiders),” Marie Herberstein, who is the Head of the Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University in Australia, told Davis. But she was careful to not completely rule out the possibility. She mentions that mites are also eight-legged, so perhaps it was just a really bit mite?

297,Michael Phelps’ alleged girlfriend says she was born intersex,"The Apple Watch will not be an accessory for your iPhone - but your iPhone will be an accessory for your Apple Watch, claims technology writer John Gruber, who expects the new wearable to cost upwards of $10,000 (£6,500/€8,800). Due to go on sale in April, the Apple Watch will start at $349 for the basic Sport model with a rubber strap, but beyond that no one knows how much the stainless steel and 18-karat gold Edition models will cost. A debate between technology and wristwatch experts is under way to determine how far into uncharted water Apple is willing to sail. First, Stephen Foskett of Grail Watch chimed in, suggesting (although using self-proclaimed ""back of envelope"" maths) the gold Apple Watch Edition will cost at least $10,000, based on the materials used. Foskett points to the huge gap in prices between stainless steel and gold versions of Swiss watches of a similar size and shape to the Apple Watch, noting how the Cartier Tank - a watch praised by Apple design chief Jony Ive - costs $7,000 in steel and $22,000 in pink gold. The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime, slightly larger than the 42mm Apple Watch, costs $8,550 in steel and $23,000 in gold - and a gold strap is a further $20,000. Apple must also price the Watch so it is protected against the volatility of gold. Foskett said: ""[Watchmakers] can't price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labour, distribution and profit in a watch."" Will the Apple Watch be gold plated to save costs? Apple Watch will go on sale before the end of April(Apple) Foskett says not. Although Apple doesn't describe the Watch Edition as being ""solid gold,"" it does say it is ""crafted from 18-karat gold,"" and nowhere is the material described as plated or gold filled. Entering the jewellery market means complying with new regulation, Foskett explains. ""There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could."" Add to this Apple's claims of producing the Watch from gold twice as hard as standard gold, and it is clear that the company will not be scrimping on materials. Foskett believes $9,999 for the 42mm model and $7,999 for the 38mm version of the gold Watch Edition could well be possible. Days later, Apple commentator John Gruber blogged to say he also thinks the price will be $10,000. ""The more I think about it, and the more I learn about the watch industry, the world of luxury goods, and the booming upper class of China, the better I feel about that bet. I don't think I was wrong to place a friendly late night bar bet on a $9,999 starting price [for the gold model]."" Gold straps Gruber says a ""starting price"" because he expects Apple to announce a new gold band when the Watch finally gets a price and release date - and for this he suspects the company will charge an additional $10,000. Looking at how Rolex charges a much higher premium for its gold models over steel - and for watches with identical movements - Gruber says the Apple Watch Edition ""is not a tech product, so don't try to price it like one... Apple's ambitions in this arena, I am convinced, are almost boundless."" Buying the Watch Edition will be unlike buying any other product in Apple's history. Reports claim the company will store the watches in safes, and that it is even considering completely separate boutique stores to sell them. Apple is expected to reveal the Watch's pricing structure and release date at a media event before the end of April 2014.

304,The Pumpkin-Spice Condom Is Just a Figment of Your Own Gross Imagination,"Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is primed and ready for a fresh assault on the streaming-video space.

The e-commerce giant will roll out a new ad-supported streaming offering early next year that will be separate from its $99-a-year Prime membership, which includes a video service, sources said.

The ad-supported option — part of an overhaul of its media offerings — poses a serious challenge to streaming rivals such as Hulu and Netflix, analysts said.

“If they do an ad-supported service, they will decouple it from Prime and that is a Netflix killer,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. “It won’t be $99 a year.”

Pachter suggested Amazon would undercut Netflix’s current monthly price of $7.99.

“Who wouldn’t switch if you were poor or you’re a cord-cutter?” he added.

Although it will be separate from Prime, the ad-supported service is ultimately a bid by Amazon to lure people to eventually pay up for Prime membership, said one ad source familiar with Amazon’s plans.

“The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn’t want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,” the source said.

The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon was weighing such a move, but sources confirmed that it’s a definite go.

Amazon is prepping a new attack at a time when its video service is gaining ground, sources said. Amazon doesn’t disclose the number of Prime members, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates it has 50 million global customers.

While Prime’s big draw has been two-day shipping, about half of Prime subscribers use the video service that is included with it, or around 25 million, sources said. By comparison, Netflix has 33 million domestic subscribers.

A recent Sandvine study also shows that Amazon is making major strides — but has a long way to go before catching Netflix. Amazon’s broadband traffic on fixed networks grew from 1.61 percent to 2.58 percent, the study showed. One change is that Amazon snagged popular HBO content, including “The Wire,” “True Blood” and “Boardwalk Empire.” Netflix accounts for 32.39 percent of aggregate traffic.

Rumors have been rampant that Amazon plans to let advertisers into its media ecosystem. Amazon has already experimented with ads in some shows, according to tech site Re/code.

For advertisers, the service could be the Holy Grail in terms of targeting. In theory, Amazon could tell if ads viewed online led to purchases on its retail site.

The news that Nielsen will start rating shows on subscription video services starting with Netflix is likely to encourage advertisers who want to make the leap without forcing Amazon to give up its own data.

Amazon will also have leverage over content producers when it comes to the way it chooses to promote shows and movies within its growing ecosystem, a Hollywood source said.

Dylan Thomas, 21, was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach

Doctors at Bali International Medical Centre initially thought he had just been bitten by a small insect and gave him an antihistamine. When it started to blister the next day, he knew some was wrong

So imagine his surprise when doctors discovered a tropical spider burrowing just below his skin a day later.

Mr Thomas, who recently returned to his Bunbury home in Western Australia, was initially given an antihistamine cream to treat the mark.

But the next morning when he found it had started to blister, Mr Thomas went to see a dermatologist.

Doctors retrieved the spider from his abdomen, which had burrowed its way through a small scar from a previous operation where he had his appendix removed

308,Jihadi John UNMASKED: Islamic State killer NAMED as west Londoner Mohammed Emwazi,"The true identity of the ISIS terrorist known as ""Jihadi John,"" who has appeared in several videos showing the beheading of hostages, reportedly has been revealed.

The Washington Post first reported Thursday, citing friends and human rights workers familiar with the case, that the man's real name is Mohammed Emwazi, a west London man who had been detained by counterterror officials in Britain at least once, in 2010. The paper also reported that Emwazi was born in Kuwait, is from a well-to-do family, graduated from college with a degree in computer programming and is thought to have traveled to Syria sometime in or around 2012.

The BBC reported that British intelligence had previously identified the man, but had chosen not to disclose his name for operational reasons.

Commander Richard Walton of the London Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command released a statement saying, ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk. We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

The masked and hooded terrorist achieved instant notoriety when he appeared in a video released by ISIS last August that showed the beheading of American journalist James Foley. At the time, many commentators and analysts remarked on the man's distinct London accent.

The man is believed to have appeared in other videos that showed the beheading of other hostages, including American journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig, known as Abdul-Rahman after his apparent conversion to Islam in captivity.

The man's most recent appearance came last month in a video with Japanese hostages Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa. Both men also were killed by the terror group.

The terrorist was given the nickname ""Jihadi John"" after interviews with former ISIS hostages revealed him to be part of a group of British jihadists who guarded the hostages and were dubbed ""The Beatles.""

The BBC reported that Emwazi is believed to be an associate of a known terror suspect who traveled to Somalia in 2006, and is allegedly linked to a funding network for the Somali-based militant group Al Shabaab.

310,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had ankle surgery, report says","A woman who claims to be the girlfriend of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps revealed in a Facebook post that she was born intersex, a fact she has not previously revealed to Phelps, among others.

Taylor Lianne Chandler, 41, wrote a lengthy post describing her early life, saying that at birth she had male genitalia with no testicles as well as a uterus, without ovaries. Born David Roy Fitch, she writes that she went on testosterone blockers and changed her name to Paige Victoria Whitney in her teens, then had surgery when she was in her 20s. She writes in a post she put up Nov. 13:

“By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one. In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery. …

“The problem is I have made friends that I never told and dated and married people that knew nothing of my past,” she writes. “If you don’t understand what intersex is, Google it. I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.”

According to the Intersex Society of America:

A general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male. For example, a person might be born appearing to be female on the outside, but having mostly male-typical anatomy on the inside. Or a person may be born with genitals that seem to be in-between the usual male and female types.

Chandler, who writes that she thinks her revelation may cause Phelps to terminate their relationship, claims on a Facebook page filled with photos of Phelps that she met the 29-year-old swimmer on Tinder and said their relationship was “like a teenage love affair” and that they attended a Baltimore Ravens game on their first date. Phelps has not commented on the post and spent the month of October in rehab after his DUI arrest in September. He is serving a six-month suspension by U.S. Swimming and his DUI trial in Baltimore is set for Dec. 19.

On Wednesday, she wrote: “Heard from Michael he is out of rehab and back home” and added that she is frustrated with how her story is being reported.

312,"No, Banksy has not been arrested (sigh)","YouTube prankster Josh Paler Lin decided to give a man named Thomas the money and follow him to see how he spends it. His first stop was a local liquor store but instead of buying alcohol he purchased food that he gave away to others in need.

A homeless man was given a chance, and he touched an awful lot of surprised people.

A viral online video from YouTube prankster Josh Paler Lin tells the story of a homeless man named Thomas and his desire to not let his circumstances keep him from being selfless - by using his newfound money to help not himself, but others.

Josh made the video, which has received more than 11 million hits by Wednesday morning, with the idea to give a random homeless person $100 and secretly follow him to see how he spends it.

He meets an elderly man with gray hair, a mustache and dark jacket named Thomas holding up a sign along a highway. He tells Josh he's just trying to get enough to buy something to eat and Josh shocks him with the $100.

""Oh goodness. Oh no way,"" he says as Josh pulls five $20 bills from his wallet. ""Oh brother, are you sure? I'm starting to tear up over here. That's like incredible.""

Josh reassures him it's totally fine as they hug. Thomas says he never had something like this happen before in his life.

The next part of the video seemed to be expected by many viewers but Thomas surprised them all.

He packed up his stuff and began walking down the road to a liquor store. The video records him exit the store with several bags, but he didn't buy alcohol.

He purchased food that he then delivered to other needy people in a nearby park.

Josh appears to tell Thomas what was going on.

""I feel like I owe you an apology,"" Josh said as he reaches to grab Thomas' hand. ""You went to a liquor store earlier —""

""You thought I was going to get all smacked up drunk, huh?"" Thomas interrupts. ""But there's things money can't buy and I get a happiness out of what I'm doing.""

Ironically during Josh's confession a man sitting at a picnic table behind them takes a swig from a bottle wrapped in a plastic bag.

But Josh wanted to contribute to Thomas's good deeds. He reached into his wallet again and gave him another $100.

""You just touched my heart,"" he told his new friend.

Thomas was stunned again.

""I don't know what to say. Usually I'm pretty talkative,"" he replied.

Thomas explained that he recently quit his job and was caring for his ailing stepfather who ultimately died of cancer. His mom died two weeks later from kidney failure and suddenly their building was sold leaving Thomas without a place to live.

""There's a lot of people that are just victims of circumstance. There's a lot of good people that are homeless,"" he said. ""You're doing good … you'll bump into good people. That's all there is to it. You're on a different path somehow in life. I can't explain it.""

But Josh is trying to change his path.

He established a fund-raising campaign to help Thomas get a new home and a job.

The fund had a goal of $10,000 but it surpassed $55,000 through Wednesday morning.

""People think I changed his life,"" Josh told TODAY. ""For me, it's completely the opposite. I feel that he changed my life.""

313,DNA tests prove Lebanon IS holding ISIS chief al-Baghdadi's ex-wife and daughter after they were caught with fake passports,"(CNN) -- A woman held by Lebanese authorities is not the wife of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Iraq's Interior Ministry said Wednesday, injecting further confusion into an already murky situation.

The reported detention of a wife and child of al-Baghdadi -- the leader of a self-declared Islamic state spanning large areas of Iraq and Syria -- has spurred intrigue into who exactly the woman is and what she might know about the terrorist group's inner workings.

But the Iraqi ministry, citing a source in an intelligence cell under its authority, said the woman's identity didn't match up with either of the names it has for al-Baghdadi's two wives.

Authorities in Lebanon, where the woman was arrested, haven't officially commented on the matter. Neither has the CIA, amid suggestions that Western intelligence was involved in her capture.

Before the Iraqi announcement further muddied the waters, the details surrounding al-Dulaimi and her capture were already pretty fuzzy.

Here are some of the main areas of interest -- and contention.

She's his wife. Or his ex-wife. Or neither.

Regional sources close to the capture told CNN that they are certain that Lebanese forces arrested al-Baghdadi's wife.

But American sources in Washington gave a different view, suggesting the person detained was al-Baghdadi's ex-wife, not a current one.

Intelligence sources had told CNN that the woman's name is Saja al-Dulaimi. But the Iraqi ministry stated bluntly Tuesday, ""There is no wife named Saja al-Dulaimi.""

It said al-Dulaimi is the sister of a man who is imprisoned in Iraq and has been sentenced to death for a series of bombings.

Iraqi intelligence identified al-Baghdadi's wives as Asma Fawzi Mohammed al-Dulaimi and Israa Rajab Mahal Al-Qaisi.

It doesn't help that Baghdadi's family life is cloaked in mystery.

A biography posted on jihadist websites last year gave little away, stating simply that he was ""married."" CNN was told al-Baghdadi has two wives. The news agency Reuters, citing tribal sources in Iraq, said he has three.

And ISIS certainly isn't confirming anything. Some of its members took to social media Tuesday to deny that any wife of Baghdadi had been arrested.

She wielded power. But how much?

If the woman is indeed Al-Dulaimi, she is a ""powerful figure"" within ISIS and is ""very active"" in the organization, a regional source with knowledge of the operation told CNN.

She was reported to have previously been held by the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad. In March, al-Dulaimi was released from Syrian custody as part of a group of 150 women who were freed in return for a group of Syrian nuns, an intelligence source told CNN.

But her apparent attempt to cross into Lebanon with a child at a time when authorities there are tightening security around the border raises questions about the state of her relationship with al-Baghdadi.

""Is he estranged from them? Has he fallen out with them? Were they escaping from him?"" asked Sajjan M. Gohel, the international security director at the Asia Pacific Foundation.

Uncertainty also remains about how much influence al-Dulaimi would have had within ISIS, which is known for its oppressive treatment of women.

Analysts say women who join ISIS may find their role limited to that of housewife for jihadi men.

But in February, ISIS formed Al-Khansaa, a female battalion with about 60 members whose job is to inspect women who pass through checkpoints and to enforce the organization's strict morality code for women.

She could reveal vital intelligence. Or hardly anything.

The arrest of al-Dulaimi, if indeed it was her, was a coordinated operation involving intelligence agencies from Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, an intelligence source familiar with the arrest told CNN.

The source said the Iraqis had help from the U.S. intelligence community, an account corroborated by a second source in the region with knowledge of the operation. But in Washington, the CIA had no comment on the matter.

Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, expressed confidence that the United States would be able to ""gain some intelligence"" from al-Dulaimi.

""We may get insights into al-Baghdadi's movement, who he surrounds himself with, whether he was injured, and the degree of his injuries,"" he said, referring to recent reports that al-Baghdadi was hurt in airstrikes.

Not everyone was convinced she would provide a treasure trove of insight into ISIS, though.

Expressing skepticism, a former senior U.S. military official told The New York Times that in the Iraq war, the Americans captured a wife of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader or al Qaeda in Iraq, ISIS' forerunner.

""We got little out of her, and when we sent her back, Zarqawi killed her,"" the unidentified official told the newspaper.

And since al-Dulaimi was reportedly seized more than a week ago, what intelligence she carried may already have passed its sell-by date.

""In military conflicts, information flows are very immediate, and they become yesterday's news very quickly,"" said Michael Stephens, a Middle East research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.

She was with a son. Or a daughter.

The identity of the child with al-Dulaimi is still the subject of conflicting reports.

An intelligence source told CNN that the child was al-Dulaimi's 4-year-old son. Other news organizations, including Agence France-Presse and the Associated Press, also reported that it was a young boy.

But Reuters, which originally had reported the same thing, later revised its reporting to say that she was with a daughter. The New York Times also said it was a daughter rather than a son.

Deepening the intrigue, one regional source even told CNN that al-Baghdadi himself has been calling up asking for his son to be released.

314,CNN Airs Alleged Audio from Michael Brown Shooting,"CNN just aired an audio tape, allegedly recorded during the Michael Brown shooting, in which eleven gunshots can be heard—nearly double the number of shots originally reported. CNN says it has not independently verified the tape's authenticity.

The recording, first played played late Monday night, was allegedly made by a man video chatting in a building near where Brown was fatally shot August 9.

After airing the tape, anchor Don Lemon interviewed the man's attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, who said the FBI had already interviewed both her and her client.

""He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building,"" Blumenthal said.

Lemon said Monday that CNN was still waiting on confirmation from the FBI.

""We had been told that at least six shots were fired at Michael Brown. In the tape that you have, which is alleged to be of the shooting—we can't independently authorize it, as CNN, because we did not shoot it, but there were more than six shots,"" Lemon said.

""I personally heard at least eleven,"" Blumenthal said.",discuss
315,Guru who ordered 400 followers to be castrated 'so they could be closer to God' is investigated for grievous bodily harm in India,"WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES. A masked militant claims the murder is in retaliation for American airstrikes against the Islamic State militants in Iraq. Missing since Nov. 22, 2012, Foley appears to be forced to read an anti-American statement before he is beheaded in the gruesome five-minute clip.

An American freelance photojournalist missing since being abducted in Syria some 22 months ago was apparently beheaded by an Islamic State militant in a graphic video released Tuesday.

Titled “A Message to America,” the gruesome clip shows a masked militant saw away at the neck of James Wright Foley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native captured in Binesh, Syria on Thanksgiving Day 2012.

The family, on its ""Free James Foley"" Facebook page, has yet to confirm his death.

""Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers,"" the statement reads.

Foley, dressed in orange and kneeling in a desert, reads what appears to be a coerced statement that alludes to recent American airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government. For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” Foley reads as he kneels beside an armed militant, masked and dressed all in black. “My message to my beloved parents: Save me some dignity, and don’t accept some minor compensation for my death from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with their recent aerial campaign in Iraq. I call on my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force: Think about what you are doing. Think about the lives you destroy, including those of your own family … I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.”

The militant, speaking English with what appears to a British accent, threatens America and President Obama, directly after Foley finishes speaking.

“So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people,” the man says, gesturing with a knife he then uses to behead Foley.

The clip begins with a video of President Obama announcing Aug. 7. American intervention in Iraq against the militants.

“Today I authorized two operations in Iraq: targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water, and facing almost certain death,” Obama said in the clip.

The 40-year-old New Hampshire native has been missing since 2012.

James Foley was reporting in the Middle East when abducted.

Foley, 40, is a New Hampshire native. He was reporting in the Middle East when abducted.

Toward the end of the video, the terror group threatens to kill another hostage, Steven Joel Soltoff, a journalist who has contributed to TIME and has been missing since the middle of last year.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the man says as he holds Soltoff by the neck.

The nearly five-minute clip has since been removed from YouTube. It’s unclear where, exactly, the murder was filmed.

The White House, in a statement from National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden, confirmed they ""have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley.""

""The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity,"" the statement reads. ""If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deppest condolences to his family and friends.""

In 2002, Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, 38, was beheaded on video in Pakistan days after being abducted by Al-Qaeda militants.

A senior Western intelligence official told Fox News that 23-year-old London rapper Abdel Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect believed to be Foley's executioner.

U.S. intelligence officials are not commenting publicly on the reports, but a well-placed source told Fox News that Bary's Egyptian-born father was extradited from London to the United States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Usama bin Laden and the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa.

Bary traveled to Syria last year to fight with  ISIS, the source said.

Emwazi was known to British security services but they chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons, it is claimed.

He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, or Isil, the group terrorising Iraq and Syria.

Jihadi John first appeared in a video last August, when he appeared to kill the American journalist James Foley.

The IS terrorist apparently studied computer sciences at Westminister University.

The Washington Post describes Emwazi as Kuwaiti born and in his mid-20s.

He was apparently raised in a middle class neighbourhood and occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich.

Friends told the Post that Emwazi began to radicalise after a planned safari to Tanzania after he graduated from Westminster.

• Who is Jihadi John?

• Does Jihadi John have a body double

Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""The man known as Jihadi John rose to notoriety when he first appeared in a video posted online in August, in which he appeared to kill the American journalist James Foley.

Dressed in all black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose and a holster under his left arm, he reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines and American aid worker Peter Kassig, as well as footage of Mr Henning's death.

And last month, the militant appeared in a video with the Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, shortly before they were killed.

A detailed Washington Post article claims Jihadi John is in fact Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, who it says travelled to Syria around 2012 before later joining IS, which has taken control of large swathes of the conflict-torn country, as well as territory in neighbouring Iraq.

The article claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day.

It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates.

Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services.

Asked if David Cameron was concerned about Emwazi's name being reported, a No 10 spokeswoman said: ""The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.

""There is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep British people safe.""

A statement from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London said: ""We believe that the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct.

""'Jihadi John' is not special, in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves.

""The fact that 'Jihadi John' has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made, the ability to mask one's identity is limited or in fact impossible, and their true identities will eventually be revealed.

""This demonstrates what we have long said about radicalisation, that it is not something driven by poverty or social deprivation. Ideology clearly plays a big role in motivating some men to participate in jihadist causes.

""British fighters have clearly demonstrated that they are not in this conflict to take a back seat. They are full participants in this war, operating as suicide-bombers, hostage-takers, and executioners.""",unrelated

Americans Believe ISIS May 'Attack the US Soon'; ISIS Demands $1 Million for James Foley Remains

According to a British military expert who has just returned from Iraq, ISIS has improvised a new weapon by putting live scorpions inside bomb canisters. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former British army and NATO head of chemical and biological weapons revealed that ISIS has thought of a new way to spread terror. He described it as ""madness"" and said ISIS promotes the use of scorpion bombs to create panic.

De Bretton-Gordon explained that scorpions are ""robust"" as the creatures can survive the impact of a launch even from a couple of miles. When the canisters break, thousands of scorpions will ""start crawling all around,"" the Mirror reported. Although not all scorpions are poisonous, the military expert said ISIS mainly wants to incite fear. The 2-ft scorpion bombs are not meant for mass casualties but are devised for maximum ""psychological impact.""

De Bretton-Gordon had returned from Baghdad last week where he took an advisory role to train Iraqi forces fighting ISIS militants. Senior officials in Iraq have reported that the scorpions were being used against civilian targets in the northern part of the country. Officials said the use of scorpions as weapons dates back to 198 AD when the creatures were stuffed into pots and thrown to enemies.

Meanwhile, ISIS militants in Mosul are preparing for an attack from the Iraqi government forces as they cut off telephone lines and imposed a ban on residents to leave the city. The Daily Telegraph was told that conditions in the city have deteriorated since ISIS is under constant pressure to fight back Iraqi ground troops.

A resident in Mosul revealed ISIS has imposed a rule that residents have to follow or else face punishment. The militants have warned residents to secure a guarantor if they wish to leave the city and come back after a few days. The Mosul resident, who asked not to be named, said people in the Iraqi city are trying to leave. Hospitals have shut down operations since there is no water or electricity.

U.S.-led coalition forces continue to launch airstrikes on ISIS targets as President Barack Obama has vowed that there will be ""no safe haven"" for ISIS.

327,Boyfriend cuts off his penis and throws it in the bin after girlfriend dumps him for being bad in bed,"LONDON — The world knows him as “Jihadi John,” the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online.

But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolize.

“I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,” said one of Emwazi’s close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. “He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him.”

[View: The atrocities of the Islamic State]

A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held.

“There was an extremely strong resemblance,” Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said after watching one of the videos. “This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.”

Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John. James B. Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September — only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley — that officials believed they had succeeded.

Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foley’s killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded.

[Read: The tactics of Islamic State beheadings]

In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm.

A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: “Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues.” ISIL is another name for the Islamic State.

U.S. officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazi’s family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice.

The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said.

He was raised in a middle-class neighborhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich.

The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalize after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster.

Emwazi and two friends — a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib — never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. It’s unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported.

Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britain’s domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post.

Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda.

The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam.

Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. “Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,” Qureshi said.

Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalize his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait.

In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again — this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so.

“I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,” he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now “I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait.”

Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had “heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!!”

In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice.

“This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation,” Qureshi said. In the end, he felt “actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions.”

Close friends of Emwazi’s also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. It’s unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how.

One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone.

“He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere,” one of the friends said. “He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out.”

Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. It’s unclear what he told them about his activities there.

A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility “the box.” Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed “George.” A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages.

Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. “He was the most deliberate,” a former hostage said.

Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic State’s de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State.

About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi.

“I was wondering if you could send me your number,” he wrote. “Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up.”

There was no response.

329,Big Bank Hank of The Sugarhill Gang is dead at 57,"A rumor on Tuesday claims Apple's upcoming Apple Watch will be priced at $500 for the mid-tier steel model and up to $5,000 for top-end gold ""Edition"" versions, a number much higher than previous estimates.

Citing an unnamed source, French website iGen reports Apple is looking to field the Apple Watch at a proposed retail cost of $500 for versions with stainless steel cases and between $4,000 and $5,000 for Apple Watch Edition models. This leaves the Apple Watch Sport version as Apple's lowest-priced option, which the company said would come in at $350.

While the website has been accurate in predicting recent Apple product launches, the claims are unverifiable and should be taken with a grain of salt.

Previous estimates from jewelers and industry analysts pegged high-end Apple Watch Edition models at $1,200. Edition versions are crafted from 18-karat gold, feature sapphire crystal and come with a variety of luxurious strap options. Apple has not commented on whether the entire chassis is solid gold, or merely gold plated, but the company apparently developed a variant of the metal twice as strong as the standard.

Additionally, the source claims Apple is still shooting for a launch on Valentine's Day.

Prior to the Apple Watch announcement, noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo accurately predicted that the device would come in two sizes and multiple models spread across a wide range of price points. At the time, he speculated the wearable could cost into the ""thousands of dollars.""

Apple announced its anticipated first foray into the wearables market in September, saying only that pricing would start at $350. Given that the Apple Watch Sport is made from relatively low-cost materials — aluminum, elastomer band and non-sapphire window — many believe it to be the entry-level model.",unrelated
330,Isis claims to behead US journalist,"The Apple Watch might be water resistant, according to comments reported by French site iGen (via AppleInsider). Either that or it's a misunderstanding, and we don't really know which. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly told employees at an Apple Store in Berlin that he wears his Apple Watch everywhere, ""even in the shower.""

Apple has not officially designated the Apple Watch as either water proof or water resistant. If Mr. Cook actually said he wears his in the shower, it could indicate that Apple will market the device as one or the other.

The problem is the report is hearsay, and there could be some translation issues. It might even have been a joke. We have no context with which to judge this story. So don't invest too much in this rumor just yet.

In fact, I personally doubt the device is water resistant or proof. Even if the device is sealed, water and touch screens don't typically work well together at all. That would make it a coup for Apple—and if anyone could do it it is Apple—but I'm not expecting a water resistant or proof Apple Watch based on this anecdote.

Then there are the straps. Apple has plastic straps. but I wouldn't want to run the metal ones or leather through a shower.

Bah. I don't like this one at all.

In the meanwhile, Mr. Cook also reportedly says he charges his Apple Watch every night. This is in keeping with the very rough comments from Apple at the device's unveiling in September. At that time, we were told Apple had designed the watch to be charged at night, though the company was unspecific about how long it would actually run.

So yeah, I can believe that hasn't changed, but we still don't have context for the comments.",unrelated
331,Michael Phelps’ alleged girlfriend says she was born intersex,"A woman who claims to be the girlfriend of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps revealed in a Facebook post that she was born intersex, a fact she has not previously revealed to Phelps, among others.

Taylor Lianne Chandler, 41, wrote a lengthy post describing her early life, saying that at birth she had male genitalia with no testicles as well as a uterus, without ovaries. Born David Roy Fitch, she writes that she went on testosterone blockers and changed her name to Paige Victoria Whitney in her teens, then had surgery when she was in her 20s. She writes in a post she put up Nov. 13:

“By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one. In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery. …

“The problem is I have made friends that I never told and dated and married people that knew nothing of my past,” she writes. “If you don’t understand what intersex is, Google it. I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.”

According to the Intersex Society of America:

A general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male. For example, a person might be born appearing to be female on the outside, but having mostly male-typical anatomy on the inside. Or a person may be born with genitals that seem to be in-between the usual male and female types.

Chandler, who writes that she thinks her revelation may cause Phelps to terminate their relationship, claims on a Facebook page filled with photos of Phelps that she met the 29-year-old swimmer on Tinder and said their relationship was “like a teenage love affair” and that they attended a Baltimore Ravens game on their first date. Phelps has not commented on the post and spent the month of October in rehab after his DUI arrest in September. He is serving a six-month suspension by U.S. Swimming and his DUI trial in Baltimore is set for Dec. 19.

On Wednesday, she wrote: “Heard from Michael he is out of rehab and back home” and added that she is frustrated with how her story is being reported.

“I never lied to him,” Chandler sayd. “We were together for such a short period of time, I never had a chance to tell him about my life.”",agree
332,Nigerians doubtful of girls' release after Boko Haram 'truce' breached,"By Isaac Abrak ABUJA, Nov 1 (Reuters) - A man claiming to be Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said more than 200 girls kidnapped by the group six months ago had been ""married off"" to its fighters, contradicting Nigerian government claims they would soon be freed. Nigeria's military says it killed Shekau a year ago, and authorities said in September that they had also killed an imposter posting as him in videos. In the latest recording it is hard to see the man's face as he his filmed from a distance. But it is likely to raise grave doubts about whether talks between a Boko Haram faction and the government in neighboring Chad will secure the release of the girls, who were kidnapped from a secondary school in Chibok, northeast Nigeria, in April. ""We have have married them off and they are all in their husbands' houses,"" the man claiming to be Shekau says. ""The over 200 Chibok girls have converted to Islam, which they confess is the best religion. Either their parents accept this and convert too or they can die."" The majority of the kidnapped girls were Christians. The man in the video also denied there was a ceasefire, and denounced Ahmadu, who says he represents Boko Haram in Chad. ""Who says we are dialoguing or discussing with anybody? Are you talking to yourselves? We don't know anybody by the name of Danladi. If we meet him now we will cut off his head,"" the man in the video says. ""All we are doing is slaughtering people with machetes and shooting people with guns ... War is what we want."" He says also that they are holding a ""white man."" The only known hostage seized in the northeast is a German teacher kidnapped from a college in the northeastern city of Gombe in July by gunmen widely assumed to be linked to Boko Haram. Shekau's denial of the ceasefire appears supported by the violence since the government announced it two weeks ago. It also raises doubts about the actual influence of Ahmadu. The five-year-old campaign for an Islamic state by Boko Haram, which has killed thousands and whose name means ""Western education is sinful,"" has become by far the biggest menace to the security of Africa's biggest economy and top oil producer. Its fighters have attacked targets almost every day for weeks and last week seized control of Mubi, the home town of Nigeria's defense chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh. It was Badeh who announced the ceasefire. They robbed banks, burned down houses and hoisted their black flag over the Emir's palace, killing dozens of people and forcing thousands to flee, witnesses in Mubi said. A car bomb thought to have been planted by Boko Haram killed at least 10 people at a crowded bus stop in Gombe on Friday morning, emergency services said. The government has blamed the violence on Boko Haram's allied criminal networks that it cannot control. There are also thought to be several competing factions within the group.

334,"Viral Video Of Homeless Man Spending $100 On Food For Other Homeless Was Faked, Witness Says","While child entrepreneurs have become increasingly common in the last decade, not many hit the lofty heights that 17-year-old “teen wolf” Mohammed Islam reached when his trading earnings reached the “high eight figures.”

As the New York Post reports, Islam, a teenager from Queens, still lives at home with his parents, but has been trading on the stock exchange on his lunch breaks at Stuyvesant High School. The Teen Wolf is the son of immigrants from Bengal in South Asia. Mohammed trades with two other friends, and they hope to start a hedge fund when the Teen Wolf turns 18 and graduates from high school.

Islam started with penny stocks at the unbelievable age of 9. When most kids are in the fourth grade, they’re learning to play sports, and figuring out fractions. Mohammed was putting his tutoring earnings to work. As often happens on the stock exchange, Islam lost his initial investment. He describes the event as “paralyzing,” and swore off the market thinking he just didn’t have the required nerves of steel.

Bengal region of Asia

Perhaps to better understand the losses that crippled him, Islam turned to studying modern finance, and became enthralled with Paul Tudor Jones. Jones is a billionaire from Connecticut who manages hedge funds and private assets. As is often the case, much of Jones’ success came on the heels of failure. Thousands and thousands of dollars lost, over and over, but Jones kept coming back for more, and ultimately captured overwhelming success. That fortitude, paired with his positive outlook, inspired Mohammed to give the game another try. And like the man who inspired him, Mohammed Islam has become a resounding success in his own right.

The Teen Wolf moniker is a reference to Leonardo DiCaprio’s portrayal of Jordan Belfort — called the “wolf of Wall Street,” another young trader who had an uncanny ability to make money on the stock exchanges. Islam and his trading buddies intend to become billionaires by next year.

“What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”

But according to Mohammed Islam and his friends, it’s not just about the money.

“We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.”

The Post reported that despite his resounding success, Islam is shy and modest, and only gave a rough estimate of his earnings. While he has a very bright future, and grand dreams for his journey into it, for now he has to content himself with expensive meals at Morimoto (an upscale Japanese restaurant), a high end BMW that he has no license to drive, and a swanky Manhattan apartment that he’s not old enough to move into.

The real “Wolf of Wall Street” wasn’t exactly role model material, and as the Inquisitr pointed out, even the movie was beleaguered in controversy and monetary fraud. Hopefully the catchy nickname “Teen Wolf” can be re-imaged by the smart and tenacious teen from New York City.",unrelated

336,Scientists Doubt That Meteor Caused Crater In Nicaragua,"We reported on Monday that a meteor, thought possibly to be a chunk of an Earth-passing asteroid, was the cause of a 40-foot crater outside the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital.

But astronomers and NASA scientists are now casting doubt on that possibility. The biggest mystery is that no one so far has reported seeing a flash of light in the sky that would be expected to accompany such a meteor strike.

""While a meteoritic origin for this crater cannot be ruled out with absolute certainty, the information available at this time suggests that some other cause is responsible for its creation,"" NASA's blog concludes.

Space.com reports:

It's a sentiment echoed by Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to Nicaragua's Institute of Territorial Studies, or Ineter, who concluded that it's ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light.

337,Fence Jumper Made It Deeper Into the White House Than Secret Service Claims,"Every superhero has an origin story, but one Russian boy’s unbelievable tale isn’t from a comic book — it’s very much real-life.

Twelve-year-old Nikolai Kryaglyachenko was walking home from school one day when he stopped to lean against a lamppost.

Unfortunately for Nikolai, the lamppost had a faulty wire and the schoolboy was blasted across the street by a jolt of electricity.

“When I came round, I felt groggy, but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened. When I woke up the next day and got out of bed, I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest,” Nikolai revealed.

Being a comic book fan, Nikolai immediately set about testing his new power, which is eerily similar to the power wielded by Marvel character Magneto.

“I can do things I couldn’t do before, but I don’t have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass — it just moved towards me,” he said.

Naturally, Nikolai’s schoolmates were fascinated by his new power, but what they didn’t know was that he could pass his ability to others, turning them into human magnets, too.

“I could even hang a ladle on my nose,” said classmate Vika Balandina.

Nikolai is not the first real-life Magneto. In fact, an entire Russian family got magnetism superpower in 1987.

A year after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, Leonid Tenkaev, his wife, Galina, their daughter Tanya and grandson Kolya were all able to stick metal objects to their bodies, according to The Guardian.

When they discovered their powers, Russian and Japanese scientists examined the family and verified that their seeming magnetism was real.

“There is absolutely no doubt that the objects stick as if their bodies were magnetic,” said Dr. Atusi Kono in 1991.

Another famous real-life Magneto revealed herself at a Superfields conference of 300 “human magnets” in 1990.

338,Boko Haram denies truce to release kidnapped schoolgirls,"WASHINGTON — A U.S. Republican senator and frequent Mideast traveler said Thursday that the Taliban detainees released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl have been in touch with members of the al-Qaida linked Haqqani network, yet all five still are being monitored in Qatar.

The Pentagon said Thursday that it is working with Qatar and is confident that any threat posed by the former detainees can be mitigated.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, who recently visited Qatar, said he had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country but said he was assured during his visit that all five remain in the small Gulf nation.

Qatar gained public praise from President Barack Obama for brokering the controversial deal in May 2014 that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity in exchange for the release of the five senior Taliban officials who had been imprisoned for years at the U.S.-run Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.

Qatar promised Obama it would keep the five under watch for one year, although they would then be free to leave.

""It's just a year deal,"" Graham told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ""Just as sure as we're sitting here, they're going back to the fight.""

""They've had some Haqqani people come to meet with them. ... They're reaching out. The Taliban five are communicating with people inside Afghanistan.""

However, Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a leading Capitol Hill voice on foreign policy, said all five are still in Qatar.

""I was afraid one had left, but they told me they're all still there,"" he said.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it would not comment on specific cases involving the detainees.

""However, we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously, and we work in close coordination through military, intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary,"" the statement said. ""The Defense Department has a close security partnership with the government of Qatar. We're confident in our ability to continue to mitigate any threat that may be posed by the former Guantanamo detainees.""

Haqqani operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and has been one of the deadliest threats to U.S. troops in the war. The network, which the State Department designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 2012, claims allegiance to the Afghan Taliban but operates with some degree of autonomy.

The five detainees released were:

Abdul Haq Wasiq, who served as the Taliban deputy minister of intelligence.
Mullah Norullah Nori, a senior Taliban commander in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif when the Taliban fought U.S. forces in late 2001.
Khairullah Khairkhwa, who served in various Taliban positions including interior minister and had direct ties to Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden.
Mohammed Nabi, who served as chief of security for the Taliban in Qalat, Afghanistan, and later worked as a radio operator for the Taliban's communications office in Kabul.
Mohammad Fazl, who Human Rights Watch says could be prosecuted for war crimes for presiding over the mass killing of Shiite Muslims in Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001 as the Taliban sought to consolidate their control over the country.

340,Saudi cleric condemns snowmen as anti-Islamic,"Mounted with a cannon and leaving a trail of shells in its wake, a black pickup truck in the hands of jihadists in Syria has brought woe to a family of Texas City plumbers by way of the insignia on its driver-side door: “Mark-1 Plumbing”.

On Monday a Chechen-led group linked to the extremist group Ansar al-Deen, a sometime ally of Islamic State (Isis) and al-Nusra fighters, tweeted a photo of the black Ford F-250 in action near Aleppo. Since then, Mark Olberholtzer and his family near Houston have received hundreds of phone calls with questions and threats.

Attempts to call the Olberholtzer family, who own Mark-1 Plumbing, reached only a recorded message or a disconnected line. On Tuesday Mark Olberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News he was mystified: “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.” His son Jeff similarly expressed bafflement to KHOU local news: “We had no intentions or idea that this would happen.”

“To think something we would use to pull trailers, now is being used for terror – it’s crazy. Never in my life would I think something like that,” the younger Olberholtzer told KHOU.

The Olberholtzers sold the truck in October 2013 to a nearby Houston dealership run by AutoNation, confirmed Marc Cannon, senior vice-president of AutoNation’s corporate communications. Cannon told the Guardian that AutoNation sent the truck to the Adesa auction house in Houston.

The car was sold on the auction block to a local used car dealer, though Adesa has not yet responded to requests to identify the dealer. An operator at the auction house told the Guardian the company has been bombarded by calls, and that she was surprised that neither the plumbers nor the jihadis had simply removed the logo.

From the port of Houston the Olberholtzers’ old F-250 likely made it to a dealership in eastern Europe, Africa or the Middle East, and within a few months changed hands several times before it finally reached a jihadist sympathizer. The truck then likely passed through Turkey’s porous border, which lies only a few hours’ drive from Aleppo and the chaotic battles so far removed from south-eastern Texas.

About erasing the logo, the elder Olberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News that AutoNation or one of the other middlemen “were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it”. The plumber of 32 years said his family has received death threats and that some of the callers “are really ugly”.

“We have a secretary here, she’s scared to death. We all have families,” his son told KHOU. “We have nothing to do with terror at all.”

His father had a message to the broader world: “I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth.”

A representative of Mark-1 Plumbing told CBS News that they plan to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo. The person said that sold vehicles would “most definitely” have the logo removed henceforth.

Auction houses, which make more profit the faster they turn products, usually sell used cars quickly, and exporters are often keen to pick up unwanted vehicles from lots. Those exporters then ship used cars into the sizeable market in developing nations, where a battered Ford can find a long second life, or where scavengers can resurrect a lemon or dismantle it for parts.",unrelated
341,Islamic State May Have Fighter Jets Now After Seizing Russian-Made MiGs,"With Apple's media event just a week away and the company expected to offer final details there on the Apple Watch ahead of its April debut, The New York Times has a new report out sharing a few new tidbits on the device.

Among the interesting details is the existence of an unannounced ""Power Reserve"" mode for the watch that will display only the time and cut off all other functions as the battery begins to run critically low, preserving the most basic functionality of the watch. The report also notes that while the Apple Watch has been widely tested by Apple employees, the company did work to conceal many of those prototypes by disguising them to resemble Samsung smartwatches.

Sources have also provided more context to a Wall Street Journal article from last month that discussed how many of the originally planned health features for Apple Watch were dropped due to consistency issues. According to The New York Times' sources, the decision to drop many of those features came more than 18 months ago, refuting off-target reports in recent weeks claiming the cuts have come at the last minute.Nearly two years ago, the company experimented with advanced health monitoring sensors that tracked blood pressure and stress, among other variables. Many of those experiments were abandoned more than 18 months ago after the sensors proved unreliable and cumbersome, these people said.

Apple long ago decided that for the first version of the product, it would include a heart rate sensor and a sensor for tracking movement, to market the device as a fitness-tracking companion to the iPhone. Previous reports have indicated Apple is still working on those technologies, and they could appear in future versions of the Apple Watch.

Today's report reveals some additional insight into the development process, noting that the Apple Watch is coming a bit later than originally hoped due to technical challenges that were likely exacerbated by the loss of several engineers working on the project. Google's Nest Labs, headed by iPod pioneer Tony Fadell, was responsible for poaching several of the key Apple Watch employees.

Apple's media event will take place at 10:00 AM Pacific Time on Monday, March 9 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. The company will offer a live video stream of the event, and MacRumors will provide full coverage of the event.

343,Did a Meteorite Impact in Nicaragua over the Weekend?,"As Apple gears up to launch the Apple Watch in April this year, Tim Cook while talking to an employee at the Apple Store spilled some extra information about the wearable before the launch. He also gave a tentative time-frame as to when Apple Pay will be reaching Europe. Also, analysts have predicted what Apple might offer at the time of its smartwatch launch.

While we already know that Apple Watch will be water resistant, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple further confirmed it as shower-proof, while chatting with a Kurfurstendamm Apple Store (Berlin) employee. Reported by iGen (via 9to5Mac), the CEO said that he always wears the watch - ""even in the shower"". Cook added that he puts his Apple Watch on charge every night, which reconfirms the expected battery life from Apple's previous statements and multiple reports.

Regarding Apple Pay, Cook said that the firm plans to bring the service to Europe not ""before the end of the year."" The announcement is somewhat a contradiction to announcements by UK banks, which in the recent past stated they were in talks to bring the Apple Pay system by the first half of 2015. According to Cook, the mobile payment system should reach Canada as soon as next month.

Meanwhile, Trip Chowdhry, an analyst from Global Equities Research has predicted that Apple might introduce as many as 100,000 apps for the Apple Watch by time it gets launched. The huge number comes from six ""Apple Watch-Kit hackathons"" in the past few months, which Chowdhry attended, according to a Barrons blog post.

He further states that the $350 (roughly Rs. 21,700) price tag for the smartwatch seems to be no issue because ""On an average an Apple Watch user will have 100 Apps installed, and one way to think about it is that the consumer is getting 100 devices for $350..i.e. $3.50 (roughly Rs. 217) per device,"" considering each app and its function as a single device.

As for the sales, Apple is being expected to ship almost 42 million units by December this year. ""Since Apple Watch extends iPhone functionality and provides user convenience with 'Glance' and 'Notifications' to an iPhone User, almost every current iPhone user, which are about 350 million users, will also be an Apple Watch user,"" he explains.

344,Meteorite strike in Nicaragua puzzles experts,"MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — Nicaragua's government said Sunday that a mysterious boom heard overnight in the capital was made by a small meteorite that left a crater in a wooded area near Managua's airport.

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a ""relatively small"" meteorite that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.""

Murillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.

The crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 12 meters (39 feet) and a depth of 5 meters (16 feet), said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.

Humberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.

346,Zack Snyder Makes Fun of Stolen Batmobile Rumor with New Image,"Doctor in besieged Syrian town reports arrival of patients with blisters, burning eyes and breathing difficulties after explosion

Kurds battling Islamic State militants for control of Kobani fear the extremist group may have used an unidentified chemical weapon, according to officials and one of the few doctors still working in the besieged Syrian town.

Patients with blisters, burning eyes and breathing difficulties turned up at a clinic after a blast was heard on Tuesday evening, Dr Walat Omar said. He described the symptoms as abnormal and said he could not identify their cause, but suspected a chemical weapon.

“After a loud explosion [on Tuesday night], we received some patients with abnormal symptoms. They reported a bad smell which produced some kind of allergic reaction,” Omar said in a telephone interview that was periodically disrupted by heavy explosions.

“Some had red patches and blisters on their skins, others had difficulties breathing and others were vomiting, with painful throats, and others with burning eyes and noses. There was one patient, all his body was covered in red patches and blisters.”

Islamic State (Isis) is thought to have obtained stocks of ageing but still potent chemical weapons when it seized Iraqi army bases where they were stored, the New York Times reported earlier this month.

In June, the group took control of a sprawling complex that had been the heart of Saddam Hussein’s chemical weapons programme, Al-Muthanna State Establishment. There may also have been chemical weapons buried or abandoned elsewhere, that were not destroyed by US forces or the Iraqi military.

Stocks manufactured before 1991 are dirty, corroded and not always easy to identify or use, but can still cause serious injury.

Iraqi officials said 11 police officers were poisoned by chlorine gas last month, when Isis fighters used it to attack the Iraqi town of Duluiya. All the officers survived.

That attack was hundreds of miles from Kobani, near the Syrian border, where Omar said he feared eight civilians had been injured by some kind of chemical attack.

Intense fighting has made it impossible to get doctors the equipment they need to do definitive tests for the use of chemical weapons, but Omar said they displayed symptoms distinct from anything else he had treated in weeks of heavy battles.

He said he had ruled out chlorine gas or biological weapons, based on his medical training, but thought the injuries were caused by a chemical. Trained in Ukraine, he is originally from Kobani and returned there to work after seven years at medical school.

“This is the first time we have seen this kind of condition,” Omar said. “I have seen other strange conditions but nothing like this before.”

The opinions of chemical weapons experts consulted by the Guardian were divided after seening a series of pictures provided by Omar of a young man with large skin blisters and a severely swollen lip.

The pictures did not have any metadata to confirm the time and place they were taken, but had not been published on the internet before Omar provided them to a Kurdish journalist.

One expert with personal experience of treating mustard gas victims said that, although the blisters were not typical, the symptoms overall were consistent with a possible sulphur mustard poisoning. That could only be confirmed with a urine or blood test.

Other experts said that while the symptoms could be consistent with exposure to a chemical agent, they were somewhat unusual and other medical conditions, such as a severe allergic reaction, would need to be ruled out.

Senior Kurdish politicians said they feared a chemical attack, and had asked for testing kits to seek confirmation.

“Many people were injured … and showed symptoms of chemical weapons use: choking, breathing difficulties, bleeding eyes, burning skin etc,” said Idris Nassan, deputy foreign minister of the Kobani administration. “Some of the doctors say that it might be phosphorus or poison gas of some kind, but the investigation is ongoing, we don’t know for sure.”

It is possible that Isis fighters could mistake some chemical munitions for ordinary weapons and use them without being aware of what they are handling. It could also be harder to evaluate the impact of attacks using partially degraded weapons, one expert said.

“Various factors might contribute to far milder symptoms than those normally associated with mustard agent exposure under combat conditions. These could include impure or degraded agent, short-term exposure, or exposure to a limited volume of agent,” said Jean-Pascal Zanders, a former analyst with the chemical and biological warfare project at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

The bomb believed to have caused the injuries treated by Omar exploded at about 10pm in west Kobani, near a hospital. Omar said he thought Isis may have targeted the medical centre to try to undermine morale, although it was not being used and none of the forces defending the city were in the area.

“Some fighters were further away, they complained about their eyes watering and burning, and pain in their nose,” he said, estimating that around 20 of them were affected but needed only basic first aid.

Regarding civilians who were closer to the blast, Omar said he was treating affected patients with oxygen, the steroid cortisone and other drugs until about 2.30am, as well as fielding calls from people who did not want to leave their homes.

The three most seriously injured patients, who ranged in age from 17 to over 40, stayed in the clinic overnight for observation and Omar was trying to arrange for their evacuation to Turkey for further treatment.

One Kurdish activist said Kobani may have been hit by teargas for the first time, perhaps drifting across from a Turkish border village where police had been using it for weeks to break up crowds of demonstrators. It has not been deployed in the intense battles for Kobani and so would not be recognised by residents, although demonstrations nearest to the border have almost all been in daylight hours, while Omar reported victims arriving well after nightfall.

347,Small red book among finds in 113-year-old Boston time capsule,"Apple’s next-generation MacBook Air, which is expected to come with a 12-inch screen, will have a “radically new design” that will abandon traditional specifications to produce a noticeably thinner and lighter device compared to the current 11-inch model, according to a report.

The upcoming MacBook Air is expected to be about a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, while also sporting a quarter-of-an-inch taller body in order to incorporate the slightly larger display, 9to5Mac reported, citing “sources within Apple” with access to “internal prototype versions” of the device. The bezels on the display could also be narrowed out on all sides to get a larger display fitted into the footprint, which is about the same size as the current 11-inch version's.

In addition to the 12-inch screen, the new MacBook Air could also feature an edge-to-edge keyboard with a redesigned key set, allowing each key to sit closer together, the report said, adding that the move is said to be aimed at making the computer as compact as possible.

The new model could also feature a revamped trackpad with the same width as that found on the 11-inch version, but with a taller frame almost touching the bottom of the keyboard, 9to5Mac reported, adding that the new trackpad may come without the clicking effect found on existing MacBook models.

Just above the keyboard of the next-generation MacBook Air, there could be four new speaker grilles that are expected to also function as ventilation ports, as the device lacks traditional computer fans.

In a bid to achieve a significantly thinner form factor, the 12-inch MacBook Air could do away with standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards in favor of a single USB Type-C port, which is reportedly smaller, faster and better than the existing USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports. In addition, the USB Type-C port is reversible, similar to that of the Lightning connector on the latest iOS devices. While the new USB Type-C port will sit on the left side of the device, the right side will accommodate the headphone jack, along with input and noise-canceling microphones, according to the report.

The details of the 12-inch MacBook Air closely follow recent rumors that the device could enter mass production in the first quarter of 2015. According to a report from Taiwan’s DigiTimes in December, Apple’s suppliers were stocking up inventory of related components for the new MacBook Air, in anticipation of the device entering production.",unrelated
348,Kurds fear Isis use of chemical weapon in Kobani,"The United States Department of Defense said on Tuesday that it is “not out of the realm of the possible” that some of the weapons and ammunitions airdropped by the U.S. military near Kobani had fallen into the hands of the Islamic State group. Earlier on Tuesday, the militant group released a video showing a cache of weapons, apparently dropped by the U.S., in their possession.

“They are certainly of the kinds of material that was dropped,” Pentagon spokesperson Rear Admiral John Kirby said on Tuesday, referring to the weapons showed in the ISIS video. “We’re taking a look at this…and when we have something definitive that we can provide in terms of an assessment on that, we'll do that.”

Kirby, however, added that he is “very confident” that most of the airdropped weapons had reached the Kurds battling the Islamic State group in Kobani. “In fact, we're only aware of one bundle that did not,” Kirby said.

The video released by the Islamic State group shows a large consignment of packages containing hand grenades and rounds for small rockets wrapped in clear plastic attached to parachute cords. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also confirmed that ISIS had seized at least one cache of weapons meant for the Kurds, according to media reports.

The U.S. military had delivered nearly 30 packages containing weapons, ammunition and medical supplies on Sunday, in an attempt to “enable continued resistance against ISIL's attempts to overtake Kobani,” according to a statement by the United States Central Command, or CENTCOM, released Sunday.

Redur Xelil, a spokesperson for the YPG, a Kurdish militia, had confirmed on Monday that Kurdish fighters had received the weapons, and said that they would “help greatly” in the battle against the Islamic State group in Kobani, according to an Al Jazeera report.

The situation in the Syrian border town, meanwhile, continues to remain “tenuous,” Kirby said on Tuesday.

“We do assess that Kurdish forces in the city are in control of the majority of the city. I would hesitate to put a number figure on that, but we do believe that they are in possession of the majority of it,” he said, adding that the U.S.-led coalition had continued to conduct airstrikes in the region.",unrelated

351,Luke Somers 'killed in failed rescue attempt in Yemen',"Although Canadian police have not released the name of the Ottawa shooter, on Wednesday afternoon U.S. sources leaked that the suspect’s name is Michael Zehaf Bibeau, a 32-year-old Canadian who was a recent convert to Islam.

Mr. Bibeau’s name was first broadcast by CBS, allegedly via U.S. intelligence sources who had been in contact with their Canadian counterparts.

The suspect—who was reportedly born and raised in Quebec—has a lengthy criminal past in Montreal, Aylmer, QC and British Columbia.

A Zehaf-Bibeau resided in Montreal’s Villeray-Saint Michel-Park Extension borough between 2004 and 2006.

His most recent court record indicates Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau fell off the map for three years, as far as the Montreal courthouse was concerned, because he failed to show up in court on a simple marijuana charge that had been filed against him on March 14, 2006.

He turned up in court more than three years later, on Dec. 12, 2009, to plead guilty to the charge. As part of his sentence he was granted an absolute discharge. (Under that charge the man was charged and convicted under the name Michael Bibeau-Zehaf.)

His most serious conviction came on Dec. 7, 2004, when Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau pleaded guilty to possession of phencyclidine, also known as PCP, and was sentenced to a 60-day prison term.

On the same day, he also pleaded guilty to marijuana possession and was sentenced to one day in prison. He has also been convicted for failing to comply with conditions of a release.

In court records related to another charge for breach of conditions, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau listed his address as being in Aylmer, QC, a city of 40,000 just 23 minutes west of Downtown Ottawa.

And, just two years ago, Mr. Bibeau was on the West Coast.




According to British Columbia Court records, a “Michael Joseph Paul Zehaf Bibeau” committed robbery in Vancouver on December 16, 2011, and also racked up a lesser charge of uttering threats.

As of Tuesday evening, Vancouver Police were working with Ottawa law enforcement to pass on information about the suspect’s time in B.C.

“The Vancouver Police Department, along with the BC RCMP, are working together to assist an Ottawa City Police and RCMP National Security investigation,” wrote Vancouver Police spokesman Randy Fincham late Wednesday afternoon. “Due to the ongoing investigation, there is little information we can share at this time,” he added.

Citing confidential sources, the Globe and Mail reported Tuesday that Mr. Bibeau was a “high-risk traveller” whose passport had been seized to prevent him from travelling abroad to join ISIS fighters in Iraq or Syria.

On Tuesday, the RCMP confirmed that Martin Rouleau, the man accused of running over two Canadian Forces soldiers in Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu, had been one of 90 suspects under similar observation.

Nevertheless, as of Tuesday the RCMP had not confirmed that they had been monitoring Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau.

Unlike other Canadian homegrown terrorist suspects, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau had no obvious web presence: No Twitter account, no Facebook page, and no Jihadist scrawls in random blogs or YouTube comment sections.

Witnesses say they saw Bibeau wearing a black coat with blue jeans, according to the CBC. The same report says gun used in the attack was a double-barrel shotgun.

Although, if the example of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu terrorist suspect Martin Rouleau is any indication, he may have changed his name following his conversion to Islam.

Before he allegedly ran over two Canadian soldiers in the parking lot of a Service Canada location, Mr. Rouleau reportedly changed his name to Ahmad LeConverti (Ahmad The Converted).

Although there are no Zehafs listed in Canadian phone books, the name Bibeau is common throughout Quebec.

On Wednesday, Quebecer Michaël Bideau noted on his Facebook page that he shared virtually the same name and birth year of the alleged shooter.

MP Ali al-Badri said, at a press conference at the parliament building in the presence of a number of deputies of Diwaniyah province and attended by IraqiNews.com that “the terrorist organization ISIS used chlorine gas for the first time in the region of Saqlawiyah after trapping more than 400 troops, resulting in the deaths of many of them due to suffocation while the terrorist gangs detonated car bombs within the brigade headquarters.”

Badri said, “We hold the full responsibility for the fate of the trapped soldiers to the Commanding General of the Armed Forces, Haider Abadi, and the security leaders, especially the Anbar Operations Chief, Lt. Gen. Rashid Flaih, because of the slow measures taken by the Air Force despite frequent appeals for rapid procedures to rescue the soldiers since several days ago.”

355,This Letter To Parents From A 1970s Lego Set Contains An Important Message For Gender Equality,"Islamic State insurgents released a video on Tuesday purportedly showing the beheading of U.S. journalist James Foley, who had gone missing in Syria nearly two years ago, and images of another American journalist whose life they said depended on U.S. action in Iraq.

The video, titled “A Message To America,” was posted on social-media websites. It was not immediately possible to verify its authenticity.

Mr. Foley, who has reported in the Middle East for five years, was kidnapped on Nov. 22, 2012, by unidentified gunmen. Steven Sotloff, who appeared at the end of the video, went missing in northern Syria while he was reporting in July, 2013.

A Twitter account set up by Mr. Foley’s family to help find him said early on Wednesday: “We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

The White House said that U.S. intelligence agents were working to verify the authenticity of the video.

Islamic State, an al-Qaeda offshoot, had not previously executed American citizens publicly. The Sunni militant group has declared a caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria in areas it controls.

The video, which was posted after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq for the first time since the end of the U.S. occupation in 2011, opened with a clip of U.S. President Barack Obama saying he had authorized strikes in Iraq.

“Obama authorizes military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope toward a new war front against Muslims,” words appear in English and Arabic on the screen.

It showed black-and-white aerial footage of air strikes with text saying “American aggression against the Islamic State”

A person identified as James Foley and wearing an orange outfit is seen kneeling in the desert as a man in black dress with a black mask stands beside him, holding a knife.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” the kneeling man says.

The man in the mask speaks in a British accent and says: “This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen, of your country. As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression toward the Islamic State.

“Today your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide.”

Following his statement, he beheads the kneeling man.

At the end of the video, words on the side of the screen say “Steven Joel Sotloff” as another prisoner in an orange jumpsuit is shown on screen.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the masked man says.

Mr. Foley, a freelance reporter, had been covering Syria’s civil war for GlobalPost. In 2011, he was held for 45 days by forces loyal to former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

Mr. Sotloff is also a freelancer journalist with published stories in Time Magazine and Foreign Policy. He has worked in Syria, Libya and Yemen.

Islamic State has executed hundreds of people in Syria and Iraq during its advance. Its members follow a hard-line interpretation of Sunni Islam but target all those who oppose it, including Sunni Muslims.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said Islamic State militants had executed 700 members of a Sunni tribe in eastern Syria in two weeks, the majority of them civilians.

“We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL,” White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said, referring to the militant group by an earlier name, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist, and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends.”

Islamic State also released another video on Tuesday that gave the strongest indication yet it might attempt to strike American targets.

The video with the theme “breaking of the American cross” boasts Islamic State will emerge victorious over “crusader” America.

It follows a video posted on Monday, warning of attacks on American targets if Washington struck against its fighters in Iraq and Syria.

The latest footage spoke of a holy war between Islamic State and the United States, which occupied Iraq for nearly a decade and faced stiff resistance from al-Qaeda.

Mufid al-Hasaynah, minister of Housing and Public Works in the Palestinian unity government, told Xinhua that Israel deliberately increases the suffering of the Gazans.

357,"ISIS Claims an American Hostage, Kayla Mueller, Died in Airstrike in Syria","A humorous report on a satirical Web site done in the style of China's state broadcaster CCTV offers advice to Chinese on how to choose their English names. ""English names come with different connotations. It’s not always fair to those people, but they do,"" the article warns. ""A name can come with a ‘feeling’ or idea about what sort of person you are, and where you come from.""

The adoption of unconventional English names in China and other parts of East Asia is the source of perennial fascination and mirth among expats. Any young Anglophone who teaches English in the region could rattle off a host of perplexing names he or she had to call out during class.

One friend of WorldViews who taught English and civics in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou had a number of students whose chosen English names were derived from screen names used during online computer games. There was Orcapm, who was not to be outdone by Skycoolz.

""Sure, have fun and pick a random object or word as a name, but avoid them if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America,"" the post chides. It offers this guide:

A good way to work out the ‘feeling’ of a name is to watch a bunch of American movies and sitcoms. They’re full of name stereotypes — you’ll find the good girls’ are all ‘Jane’s, the jock boys’ are still ‘Buds’ and the geeks’ are called ‘Sheldon’.

The report also lays out a set of rules governing the types of English names typically adopted by Chinese. Be careful about what may sound inappropriate alongside common Chinese family names such as Wang or Dong. In general, it's good to avoid food as a name, it suggests.

To put bluntly, names like Candy, Lolly, Sugar (think anything sweet), are typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.

It’s not always right; there are doubtless some very smart Candy’s out there. But it’s the first thing that comes to mind.

Other instructions include eschewing the names of famous leaders or celebrities. ""Pick any name like Obama, Einstein or Madonna and you’re going to get some stares,"" it says. ""You have some pretty big shoes to fill there.""

At a McDonald's restaurant in Hong Kong, WorldViews once was served by an employee whose badge confusingly read ""Franco Mussolini."" One hopes he didn't harbor similar dreams of power and domination.

While it's easy to make fun of such unusual naming conventions, it's also hard not to appreciate the playfulness with which these names get chosen. Often, Chinese people pick an English name as a play of words based on their original given Chinese name. The Atlantic offers a few examples from the Cantonese-speaking city of Hong Kong:

Many English names mimic the sound of Chinese given names. A solicitor called Tse Kar-son, for example, has Carson as his English name. Singer Lee Hak-kan's English name is Hacken. Another singer, Chan Yik-shun, is called Eason...

Ho Wai-leuk, a journalist, got his name another way. ""When I was a student, everyone kept saying my Chinese name really fast until it started sounding like 'hoh lok,'"" he said referring to the Cantonese pronunciation for Coca-Cola, ""so Cola stuck.""

For most people, our names are our names and we have little choice in the matter. But the practice of adopting a new English name can be seen as an exercise in self-expression, especially in societies where larger trends of conformity hold some sway.

Who wouldn't want to be able to re-brand themselves or be able to highlight some unique part of their identity? Just don't use that power to call yourself ""Bunny Wang,"" the post says.

He also gave a tentative time-frame as to when Apple Pay will be reaching Europe. Also, analysts have predicted what Apple might offer at the time of its smartwatch launch.

While we already know that Apple Watch will be water resistant, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple further confirmed it as shower-proof, while chatting with a Kurfurstendamm Apple Store (Berlin) employee. Reported by iGen (via 9to5Mac), the CEO said that he always wears the watch - ""even in the shower"". Cook added that he puts his Apple Watch on charge every night, which reconfirms the expected battery life from Apple's previous statements and multiple reports.

Regarding Apple Pay, Cook said that the firm plans to bring the service to Europe not ""before the end of the year."" The announcement is somewhat a contradiction to announcements by UK banks, which in the recent past stated they were in talks to bring the Apple Pay system by the first half of 2015. According to Cook, the mobile payment system should reach Canada as soon as next month.

Meanwhile, Trip Chowdhry, an analyst from Global Equities Research has predicted that Apple might introduce as many as 100,000 apps for the Apple Watch by time it gets launched. The huge number comes from six ""Apple Watch-Kit hackathons"" in the past few months, which Chowdhry attended, according to a Barrons blog post.

He further states that the $350 (roughly Rs. 21,700) price tag for the smartwatch seems to be no issue because ""On an average an Apple Watch user will have 100 Apps installed, and one way to think about it is that the consumer is getting 100 devices for $350..i.e. $3.50 (roughly Rs. 217) per device,"" considering each app and its function as a single device.

As for the sales, Apple is being expected to ship almost 42 million units by December this year. ""Since Apple Watch extends iPhone functionality and provides user convenience with 'Glance' and 'Notifications' to an iPhone User, almost every current iPhone user, which are about 350 million users, will also be an Apple Watch user,"" he explains.

362,"Boko Haram agrees to ceasefire, release of school girls","Nigeria’s government and Boko Haram have agreed a ceasefire that brings closer the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in the north of the country more than six months ago.

Secret meetings held between the authorities in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, and representatives of the al-Qaeda-linked militia have led to an temporary agreement to lay down arms.

Part of the deal includes “the need to rescue all the captives of the terrorists, including the students of Government Girls’ Secondary School, Chibok”, said Mike Omeri, anti-terrorism spokesman of the president’s national information centre.

There would also be an immediate ceasefire, with Boko Haram apparently saying it would suspend its bombing and kidnap campaign, and the Nigerian army agreeing not to target suspected militant camps.

“From the discussions, [Boko Haram’s representatives] indicated their desire for, and willingness to discuss and resolve all associated issues,” Mr Omeri said. “They also assured that the school girls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well.”

The announcement came days after protesters marched in Abuja to mark the six-month anniversary of the girl’s abduction. Close to 300 teenage girls were kidnapped by armed gunmen as they were driven back to their school in coaches after an excursion.

Some managed to escape, but an estimated 219 are still being held captive, reportedly in Nigeria’s neighbour, Cameroon, whose military was involved in the ceasefire talks.

There was immediate scepticism, however. One Western diplomat in Lagos, Nigeria’s coastal commercial capital, pointed out that Goodluck Jonathan, the president, is in the middle of campaigning for the presidential elections due next year.

“He’s having a tough run with Boko Haram, and he needs a boost,” the diplomat said. “It’s the main thing that people are concerned about, security. If he can score a ceasefire, great. If he can bring the girls back, even better.

“But we’ve not yet heard from Boko Haram. Until then, we’re taking this with a little salt.”

Aid groups working to secure the release of the schoolgirls welcomed the news, but also remained cautious.

“This ceasefire is incredibly promising, but we aren’t there yet,” said Hussaini Abdu, country director for ActionAid Nigeria. “Until every girl is released negotiations must continue.

“We are excited about the possibility of restoring peace in the country, but these girls must remain a priority and we therefore urge the government to ensure that the safety of all of them is guaranteed as part of any truce.”

Britain is among several nations that has offered assistance to the Nigerian government and its military to help find the missing schoolgirls.

Privately, Western security sector sources in the country report exasperation among those coming to help over the slow pace of the Nigerians’ reactions to the kidnap crisis.

The girls are understood to have been separated into several groups, making an armed rescue far more complicated and dangerous, leaving talks as the only likely route to their release.

Boko Haram has in the past insisted that it would only release the teenagers if Nigeria freed several of the group’s senior commanders, who have been captured and are in jail. There were no immediate details of what Boko Haram will get out of the ceasefire deal.

The group has been blamed for hundreds of killings in bomb or gun attacks, and it is increasingly choosing targets over an ever wider area of northern Nigeria.

It began as a local militia targeting people who broke strict Islamic regulations such as drinking alcohol. But it recently linked with al-Qaeda’s franchise in West Africa, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and appears to have taken on far more ambitious aims, including ridding northern Nigeria of Christians.

Boko Haram’s leader, Abubakar Shekau, frequently justifies attacks on Christians as revenge for killings of Muslims in Nigeria’s volatile “Middle Belt”, where the largely Christian south and mostly Muslim north meet.

The Telegraph revealed last month that the International Committee of the Red Cross had become involved in a secret prisoner swap deal that would ensure the schoolgirls' return.

Officials from the Geneva-based organisation sat in on talks between the Nigerian government and a senior Boko Haram leader that was being held in one of the country's maximum security prisons.

The Red Cross officials also visited a number of other jails, identifying a list of 16 senior commanders that Boko Haram wants freed in exchange for the 219 hostages kidnapped from the north-east town of Chibok.

The ICRC's role in the talks represented the first official confirmation that the Nigerian government was actively engaged in talks with Boko Haram.

Publicly, Nigeria's president, Goodluck Jonathan, has previously maintained that the government would never agree to any kind of negotiations.",discuss
363,Led Zeppelin’s Robert Plant ripped up a $924 million reunion contract,"Piper Jaffray’s Gene Munster has issued a new report to investors, breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices. The analyst predicts that the stainless steel Apple Watch will be priced at $499, while the 18k Gold Edition will sell for $4,999, AppleInsider reports. He also said that on average, consumers will spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Apple watch versions

Apple Watch will be released in three separate price tiers i.e. Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, with each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices. Starting with Apple Watch Sport, Munster expects an ASP (average selling price) of $450 including configuration choices like case and internal storage options. The stainless steel Apple Watch model is expected to start at $499 to $549, with an overall ASP at around $650. Regarding the Apple Watch Edition, the analyst forecasts the base model to start at $4,999, while classifying segment ASP at $7,500.

Based on current pricing for Apple’s silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars. 

“If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,” Munster writes. 

Lastly, Munster expects the Sport model to make up 55% of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take 45%. As for Apple Watch Edition, Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year.

CNN aired the tape but cautioned that it could not independently verify whether it was authentic.

A new audio recording surfaced Monday night that allegedly indicates the police officer who shot Michael Brown paused briefly in the middle of unleashing a barrage of at least 10 bullets.

CNN aired the tape but cautioned that it could not independently verify whether it was authentic. It was allegedly filmed near the shooting scene in Ferguson, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis, on Aug. 9.

It was reportedly recorded by a Ferguson resident who could be heard talking with or about a woman while gunfire suddenly erupted in the background.

About six shots in rapid fire could be heard, followed by two seconds of quiet and four additional shots.

“That was what caught my attention initially,” said Lopa Blumenthal, a lawyer for the unnamed man who claims to have made the recording. “It shows a point of contemplation.”

CNN said it could not corroborate the tape’s authenticity, and has reached out to the FBI for confirmation.

Six months before he shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown, police Officer Darren Wilson (pictured) earned a commendation for his “extraordinary effort in the line of duty.” Wilson’s father posted these photos to his Facebook page.

Michael Brown (left) was shot by Ferguson, Mo., Police Officer Darren Wilson (right).

Brown, 18, was unarmed when Officer Darren Wilson shot him after stopping the teen for jaywalking. Witnesses have said that after the initial confrontation with the cop, in which at least one round was fired, Brown was walking away with his hands up and was fired at again.

If the audio is verified by investigators, the pause could bolster the witness accounts.

A preliminary autopsy showed that the teenager was struck at least six times, with two bullets hitting his head.

366,"Boko Haram denies cease-fire, leader says he married off kidnapped girls","Islamic State militants have released a graphic video allegedly depicting the beheading of American photojournalist James Wright Foley, who has been missing in Syria since 2012.

The Islamist group also threatened to kill another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff of World Affairs and Time, stating his fate is in the hands of President Barack Obama.

Foley went missing almost two years ago while covering the conflict in Syria as a freelance photographer. The 39-year-old reporter was working for Agence France-Presse when he disappeared, and his whereabouts were essentially unknown until this recording surfaced.

His November 22nd disappearance was classified as a kidnapping by the FBI, which stated he “was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria.”

In the new video, the militants proclaimed the violent act as “a message to America” for its decision to launch airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq, where it has made rapid territorial conquests over the last few months.

After stating that President Obama’s decision to authorize military action against the extremist group “effectively [placed] America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims,” Foley appears kneeling beside a masked man. He is forced to read a letter which blames the US government for “hammering the final nail into his coffin” before the masked man takes his life.
Sotloff’s life, meanwhile, “depends on Obama’s next decision,” the group claimed. Sotloff has been missing since mid-2013, and his Twitter account indicates his last known location was Libya.

In a statement, the US National Security Council confirmed it had seen the video, but added that it's still working to determine its authenticity.

""If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.

The video’s release comes just one day after militants declared they would attack American targets “in any place” if American airstrikes kill any of their members. Militants said, “we will drown all of you in blood” and flashed images of an American was beheading during the United States’ initial invasion of Iraq.

So far, the Islamic State’s campaign through Iraq has seen numerous reports of beheadings, including those carried out against child victims. The group has regularly threatened Christians and other minorities to either convert to their radical take on Islam or die, and even forced tens of thousands of ethnic Yazidis to flee to Sinjar Mountain with no food or water in order to escape being executed.

The last event triggered renewed military and humanitarian action by the United States earlier this month, and airstrikes have been used to help Kurdish security forces beat back militant fighters from northern Iraq. On Monday, Obama announced Iraqi and Kurdish forces had retaken control of the Mosul Dam – Iraq’s largest, and a key strategic landmark – marking the most significant victory for Iraqi troops since the US became involved again.",unrelated

The internet has been salivating at the prospect of getting stoned and eating fried chicken this week, after reports circulated that KFC is to become a marijuana dispensary as well as a restaurant.

A story on Racket Report claimed that with tax revenue from sales of the drug being so high in Colorado, KFC wanted a piece of the action, with the added benefit that its chicken would see a boost in sales thanks to the munchies.

It looks to be false for several reasons however:

- Racket Report has carried a lot of hoax stories in the past

- KFC hasn't mentioned marijuana on its official news page

- Marijuana sales are currently cash only which would make things tricky for the chain

- Marijuana is still in somewhat of a legal grey area and probably not crystal clear enough for a giant brand to start slinging it

- KFC doesn't even sell alcohol, so they'd really be jumping in at the deep end

While weed might not be hitting KFC any time soon, with sweeping legalisation in the US this sort of thing is inevitable.

368,Report: 4 ISIS Terrorists Caught at Southern Border in 36 Hrs,"You want a gold Apple Watch, you say? Then it's going to cost you... a lot. 

The vanilla variant of Apple's newest wrist-worn wearable device only costs $349. However, if you're willing to spend big cash on something that has the Apple logo on it, the company would be more than willing to accommodate. 

According to analyst John Gruber, the gold version of the upcoming device may cost about as much as the monthly salary of a middle-class worker in the United States. Gruber predicts that the gold Apple Watch would cost $5,000. The figure is basically just a guess. However, it's not an uneducated one. 

""Most people think I'm joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000. I couldn't be more serious,"" Gruber wrote in a blog post. ""The lowest conceivable price I could see for the Edition models is $1,999 -- but the gold alone, just as scrap metal, might in fact be worth more than that.""

Gruber claims that Apple told him that the gold version of the Apple Watch is made of solid 18-karat gold. It is not gold-plated. This caused him to revise his guess on the price of the device.  

He based his estimate on the going rate for solid gold watches from other manufacturers. Challenging people to find a solid gold watch that costs less than $20,000, he cited a leaked price list for Rolex from 2012. Luxury watch companies don't set prices for their products; they leave that to their authorized dealers. This means that the products on the price list may have ended up being sold for a higher price. In the list, an 18-karat gold Rolex had a price tag of $34,250.


Gruber suspects that the reason Apple has been mostly silent about the specs for the device is that they don't know what the capabilities of the finished product would be. 

""What does Apple Watch actually do? Or, rather, what does WatchKit allow? We don't know. And Apple is not talking, even off the record. One factor is that the software (and perhaps the hardware internals remain a work in progress). It is far from a finished product,"" he said. 

Aside from the gold version, Gruber also predicts a stainless steel version of the device that costs $999. It's not clear whether fancier variants of the device would be available with the sport version at launch. Nonetheless, the Apple Watch is expected to ship in early 2015.",unrelated

Customers will literally have dozens of watch configurations to choose from. Only the base model got an official price of $349, however. Now a report claims to have pricing information on other editions.

MacRumors spotted a French blog whose sources suggest the stainless steel Apple Watch variant will start at $500 while gold models could cost $4,000 and up. The iGen blog has been credible in the past, correctly predicting the size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

If you take the view that Apple Watch is simply another smartwatch or gadget, the prices may not make that much sense. Look at the device as a fashion statement with smarts, though, and the anticipated costs sound viable. Apple has designed the watch and will market it as a modern timepiece that adds smartwatch functions to your wrist. It’s already considered a luxury brand by many and people are clearly willing to pay premium prices for that brand.

The stainless steel pricing is certainly believable to me. Look at Pebble to see why.

Pebble Steel fashion

 


You can buy a plastic Pebble smartwatch for as little as $99 now, recently discounted from its $149 price. The same watch and functionality in a more aesthetically pleasing stainless steel case will cost you $199, or double the plastic model’s price. It’s reasonable to assume an Apple Watch with stainless steel casing will cost $500 based on that. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see that come with a leather strap, with an additional $50 to $100 cost for a matching stainless steel strap.

Unfortunately, we’re not likely to know the official retail costs until this coming spring, as Apple won’t be selling the Apple Watch until then. For now, potential customers have time to save up for Apple’s timepiece — something they may need to do if they want an Apple Watch in gold.",discuss

Libyan terrorists have posted pictures of themselves online posing with some of the aeroplanes taken from Tripoli airport after fighters seized it last month.

Soldiers from the group Libyan Dawn can be seen climbing on to the wings of commercial jets while smiling and waving for the camera.

U.S. officials fear that these aeroplanes could now be used to carry out 9/11-style attacks in the region on the anniversary of the tragedy this month.

A total of 11 commercial jets from state-owned carriers Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways went missing in August after militants from the so-called 'masked men brigade' overran the airport.

Tripoli airport was left as little more than a smouldering ruin after rebels seized control of it in August

Officials have been warning for some time about the deteriorating situation in Libya, which was controlled by dictator Muammar Gaddaffi until he was killed in October 2011.

'There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,' one official told the Washington Free-Beacon. 'We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.'

September 11 not only marks the anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center but it will also be the second anniversary of the raid of the U.S. Ambassador's compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Four Americans were killed in the attack, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

Ansar al-Shariah, the group Washington holds responsible for the attack, have also seized parts of the Libyan capital and are known to work with terrorists from ISIS.

However they are not thought to be working with fighters from Libyan Dawn, as they are an Al-Qaeda affiliated group.

Libyan Dawn, an Al-Qaeda affiliated group, are now in control of part of Tripoli, as are Ansar al-Shariah, the group held responsible for the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Libya

Tripoli International Airport was being run by two anti-Islamist militias and had been closed since mid-July when it was taken over at the end of August by the group Libyan Dawn.

Pictures show the aftermath of the firefight, with planes completely or partially blasted and several littered with bullet holes.

Tripoli is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gaddaffi left power. The militias, many of which originate from rebel forces that fought Gaddaffi, became powerful players in post-war Libya, filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army.

Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order, but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped-for transition to democracy.

On Sunday, the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital.

Ansar al-Sharia has ties to the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), the Syrian group which today released the filmed beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff - the second recorded execution of a U.S. hostage by the group.

Fears: Nearly a dozen commercial planes are missing in Libya after a radical Islamic group overtook the international airport in the capital of Tripoli late last month.

Aftermath: Tripoli International Airport was overtaken by the group Libyan Dawn last month and now 11 aircraft for Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways are missing

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui told Al Jazeera television after the airport attack that the planes had been taken by another Islamic group, the Masked Men Brigade.

Mekkaoui said there is 'credible intelligence' that the Masked Men Brigade 'is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the Maghreb state' on the 9/11 anniversary.

Sebastian Gorka, a counterterrorism expert, told the Free-Beacon that the planes could be used in two ways to strike North Africa or even as far as the oil fields of Saudi Arabia.

'The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,' Gorka, the Maj Gen Charles Horner chair at the Marine Corps University, said.

'The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,' he added.

U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the eleven planes' disappearance, but are reportedly working to track them down.

372,Islamic State militants claim to behead missing American journalist,"Claim: Eleven passenger planes are missing from an airport in Libya.

PROBABLY FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, September 2014]

Seeking truth in stir of 11 missing / stolen commercial airliners from the Libyan airport during the fall of Tripoli.

Origins: In early August 2014, some North African bloggers began to spread stories that several commercial airliners were missing from the Tripoli International Airport during or shortly after the facility was taken over by Zintan militia forces earlier in the summer. Later that month translations of the blog posts began to be picked up by news outlets in Western Europe and passed on as fact rather than gossip; by early September those tales of translations of blogs had spread to the United States under the guise of real news.

The use of airplanes as terrorist weapons in 2001 makes it all too easy for us to anticipate their being used that way again. And despite denials from all sides — the airlines who are not missing any planes, the Libyan transport ministry, and the anti-government forces in control of the airport — the tales have found a ready audience among a populace already on edge in anticipation of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

However, there have been no statements from the State Department, the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, or any other authority warning of stolen airliners. The national threat level has not been raised. Algerian and Moroccan military and air defense, already on high alert due to the unrest just across their borders with Libya, would undoubtedly have noticed multiple flights of unidentified passenger aircraft.

373,ISIS Militants Allegedly Contracted Ebola,"NEW YORK — Pope Francis has given hope to gays, unmarried couples and advocates of the Big Bang theory. Now, he has endeared himself to dog lovers, animal-rights activists and vegans.

Trying to console a little boy whose dog had died, Pope Francis told him in a recent public appearance on St Peter’s Square that “paradise is open to all of God’s creatures”. While it is unclear whether the Pope’s remarks helped soothe the child, they were welcomed by groups such as the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

In his relatively short tenure as leader of the world’s one billion Roman Catholics since taking over from Benedict XVI, Pope Francis, 77, has repeatedly caused a stir among conservatives in the church.

He has suggested more lenient positions than his predecessor on issues such as homosexuality, single motherhood and unwed couples.

Theologians cautioned that Pope Francis had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.

Reverend James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor-at-large of America, a Catholic magazine, said he believed that Pope Francis was at least asserting that “God loves and Christ redeems all of creation”, even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals. “He said paradise is open to all creatures,” Rev Martin said.

The question of whether animals go to heaven has been debated for much of the church’s history. Pope Benedict said during a 2008 sermon that when an animal dies, it “just means the end of existence on earth”.

Ms Christine Gutleben, senior director of the Humane Society, said Pope Francis’ apparent reversal of his predecessor’s view could be enormous. “If the Pope did mean that all animals go to heaven, then the implication is that animals have a soul. And if that is true, then we ought to seriously consider how we treat them because they mean something to God,” she said.

Ms Sarah Withrow King, director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA, one of the most activist anti-slaughterhouse groups, said the Pope’s remarks could move Catholics away from consuming meat. But there are differing views.

Mr Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, said in an email that it “certainly does not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin”. THE NEW YORK TIMES",unrelated
374,Boko Haram ceasefire ignored as violence flares in Borno state,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria — The leader of Nigeria’s Islamic extremist group Boko Haram has denied agreeing to any cease-fire with the government and said more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls all have converted to Islam and been married off.

In a new video released late Friday night, Abubakar Shekau dashed hopes for a prisoner exchange to get the girls released.

“The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,” he said, laughing.

“In this war, there is no going back,” he said in the video received by The Associated Press in the same way as previous messages.

Nigeria’s chief of defense staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, on Oct. 17 announced that Boko Haram had agreed to an immediate cease-fire to end a 5-year-old insurgency that has killed thousands of people and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes in northeast Nigeria.

But attacks and abductions have continued with the extremists this week seizing Mubi, a town of more than 200,000 people. Fighting also continued Friday in Vimtin, the nearby village where Badeh was born.

Shekau in August announced that Boko Haram wanted to establish an Islamic caliphate, along the lines of the IS group in Syria and Iraq. Fleeing residents have reported that hundreds of people are being detained for infractions of the extremists’ version of strict Shariah law in several towns and villages under their control.

Boko Haram’s kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls taking exams at a boarding school in the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April prompted an international campaign for their release and criticism of Nigeria’s government for not acting quickly to free them. Dozens of the girls escaped on their own in the first couple of days, but 219 remain missing.

Unconfirmed reports have indicated that the girls have been broken up into several groups and that some may have been carried across borders into Cameroon and Chad.

The government had said it had negotiated with two Boko Haram leaders in Chad, with talks hosted by President Idriss Deby, and that it was confident the girls would be freed soon. But Boko Haram has many factions.

Shekau’s announcement further discredits the government of President Goodluck Jonathan, who on Thursday formally announced his candidacy for elections on Feb. 14, 2015 in Africa’s most populous nation. Nigeria, with some 160 million people, is divided almost equally between Muslims who dominate the north and Christians in the south. The West African nation is the biggest oil producer on the continent and has its biggest economy.

Jonathan’s failure to curtail the insurgency and many corruption scandals are not expected to dim his chances of success. The election, though, is expected to be the most hotly contested since his People’s Democratic Party took power after decades of military dictatorship ended in 1994.

Dozens of ruling party legislators have defected to the coalition All Progressives Congress, losing the PDP its majority in the lower house of Parliament. But the coalition is weakened by its inability to choose a presidential candidate, and primaries in December will be contested by three powerful northerners who all are Muslim.

Jonathan, a Christian from a minority southern tribe, has been criticized for ignoring an unwritten party rule to alternate power between Christian and Muslim leaders, adding a religious and ethnic dimension to the election.",disagree
375,Report: Missing Libyan jetliners raise fears of suicide airliner attacks on 9/11,"On Friday, Esquire.com's Ben Collins wrote a blog post in which some awkward phrasing made it appear as though tonight's episode of Monday Night Countdown on ESPN will feature a special panel discussion on domestic violence.

Here's how his post starts:

On Monday night, a panel on a two-hour pregame show for Monday Night Football will, among other things, address domestic abuse. This panel will discuss, once again, the appropriate penalty for hitting a woman.

The panel for that discussion will include the following people: Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Stuart Scott, Steve Young and Ray Lewis.

Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24.

When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they'll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber.

These people are not allowed at the table.
Collins's outrage at ESPN's failure to include any women in a discussion dedicated to domestic violence was shared by many, and word of the ""panel discussion"" began to spread across Twitter:









And then there were a lot of other blogposts, piggybacking off of Collins's, with headlines like these:

ESPN Doesn't Get It: They Ignore Women's Voices In Public Dialog About Domestic Violence
ESPN's Domestic Violence Panel Is Missing Something Important
11 Men and 0 Women on Tonight's ESPN Domestic Violence Panel
ESPN's Domestic Abuse Tonight Panel Will Be 100% Dudes
ESPN to save NFL's image with all-male domestic abuse discussion
And then feminist organization UltraViolet blasted this press release to various media outlets:

UltraViolet Calls on ESPN to Include Women in Discussion About Domestic Violence

Statement from Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of UltraViolet, on ESPN's announcement that a 11 man panel will discuss domestic violence during their Monday Night Football pre-game roundtable:

""By having a roundtable on domestic violence and not including any women, much less survivors of domestic violence, the panel is the height of ignorance by ESPN. ESPN must be getting their PR advice from their buddies at the NFL. Both the NFL and ESPN seem to greatly misunderstand the problem they are trying to address and the millions of people's lives it effects.""

While it's good to see ESPN taking on the issue of domestic violence within the NFL tonight, we strongly believe that they should also include the voices of women and survivors of domestic violence at the table. With nearly 45% of NFL fans and viewers being women, including women at the table not only would add to the discussion but would address the realities of their audience and the issue at hand.""
But tonight's episode of Monday Night Countdown is just going to be a regular episode, and will not be featuring any special discussion about domestic violence. We reached out to ESPN PR, who told us that talk of the special panel was ""false info"" and that tonight will feature a ""regular episode of Countdown hosted by Suzy Kolber.""

There are certainly criticisms to be made of Monday Night Countdown fielding such a dude-heavy panel that is painfully ill-equipped to speak intelligently about any issue of substance, as has been proven in the past. Tonight, however, it's highly unlikely that domestic violence will even come up.

Update: And here is a statement from ESPN:

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight's Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting and Lisa Salters reporting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more.",unrelated

377,Tropical spider 'burrowed under man's skin through scar' - video report,"Keen golfers can have their very own putting paradise if they snap up this luxury island previously owned by Tiger Woods.

The island in Lake Mälaren, Sweden, was one of the homes shared by the 14-time major winner and his ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, before their six-year marriage fell apart in 2010.

The 62-acre island features a secluded villa, a hunting lodge, its very own landing strip for propeller planes as well as, of course, six tee-off areas for a custom-made golf hole.

Very private: The 62-acre island previously home to Tiger Woods and his ex-wife Elin Nordegren

Riches: The island in Lake Mälaren, Sweden, was just one of the homes shared by golfer and his ex-wife

Secluded: The island's villa, built from wood cut from the island itself, according to the estate agents

Serene: The residence on the island is apparently the only home for many miles around

Rustic: Yet the wooden construction also includes modern conveniences like a hot tub and gas barbecue

Kitted out: The kitchen, including breakfast bar, wood-burning stove and a disguised extractor fan

Welcoming: The bedroom. Tiger Woods and his wife split after his infidelity became public

Room to live: The kitchen and living room share an open plan space with the wood ceiling rising high above

It also includes a protected quay, a private ferry boat, a historic hill fort, pasture land for horses, stables and two small Skinnpälsarna islands with a water area of around 500 acres.

But potential buyers will have to bring their own clubs as the main building comes unfurnished.

Sabine Rollinger of Vladi Private Islands, who are listing the island, told Mercury Press Agency: 'This island was owned by Tiger Woods but after his divorce he doesn't need an island in Sweden any more.

'This is a unique, exclusive private island with total privacy.

'It includes a private harbour, untouched woods, beautiful lush parks, open fields, striking lake views and a tastefully designed main residence, a mini-mansion.

'Also on the island is a landing strip and six tee-off areas for golf practice.

'The secluded villa, hunting lodge and stables are located on the main island and surrounded by a very large lawn.

Log cabin: The hunting lodge offers another space away from the main house for times you want to be alone

Fore! The island includes six teeing off areas for a single custom golf hole

Neigh: These are the stables on the island which, along with the private pasture, would be great for horses

Well lit: As darkness falls, you can see the house is tastefully illuminated by a number of external lights

Is that an outside swimming pool? If so, it's an ambitious choice for Sweden, with its long, chilly winters...

A luxury yacht on the island: The protected quay catches the evening sun and it's only an hour's boat ride from the island to the Stockholm archipelago and the sights and sounds of the Swedish capital

Happy times: Tiger bought the place when married to Swede Elin

'Here you can land your private prop airplane, play soccer, do some riding or enjoy unstructured golfing.

'A hundred metres from the villa is the private, protected bay, and a 50-metre long quay that provides plenty of space for your own, and your friends' boats.

'This is the place to begin great fishing trips in your own private fishing waters, take a boat ride out to Mälaren's over 1000 islands or the beautiful archipelago of Stockholm.

'This island is also unique due to its central location as the Swedish capital is only about an hour away by boat or car, and from there you have swift access to the Stockholm archipelago.

'The property even has a historical 11th century Viking stronghold, a dramatic landscape with approximately 30 metres high rocks rising out of the lake.

'The island boasts a variety of wildlife, such as deer, hares and beavers - even elks can be seen on occasion.

'The protected location, combined with the quay's generous dimensions, make it an ideal place for private parties and outdoor dining.

'You go for a swim in Lake Mälaren, where the water reaches temperatures of up to 26C in the summer.

'Apart from the island, the property also includes the two small Skinnpälsarna islands and a water area of around two million square metres.'

378,ISIS Getting Ebola,"Everyone's been waiting years and years for a meaningful update to the MacBook line. According to a report from 9to5 Mac, this will be the year that a new design will arrive. The blog just published a few renderings based on details from unnamed Apple employees. And if they're correct, this new MacBook looks awesome.

The report comes from 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman, who tends to be a reliable source on all things Apple. The details also match up with many of the rumors about MacBook upgrades in recent years. Chief among them is how Apple will ditch ports almost altogether to achieve a slimmer, sleeker profile. Sources say that prototypes for a new 12-inch MacBook Air are a quarter inch narrower than the current 11-inch model. They also have fewer ports than any other Apple computer: a headphone jack and a single USB Type-C port.

Another less dramatic detail is the slimmer keyboard. Apple's designers are channeling the old 12-inch PowerBook by pushing the keys all the way to the edge. They're also evidently narrowing the amount of space in between the keys to squeeze them together a little bit more. Meanwhile, the trackpad will no longer click in order to make the body thinner. It almost sounds like some sort of feature liquidation, all designed to make this machine as sleek as possible.

It looks pretty amazing, though! If that is what Apple actually does, of course. Click over the 9to5Mac for more on the new laptop design. [9to5Mac]

379,Obama Denounces James Foley's Execution: 'Today The Entire World Is Appalled',"A picture of a letter to parents from a box of Lego in the 1970s is going viral after being uploaded to Reddit.

To Parents.

The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.

It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.

A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses.

The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.

The image was uploaded by Reddit user fryd_ on Saturday morning. He spoke to BuzzFeed News about it:

I came across the pamphlet whilst playing Lego with my niece & nephew at their Grandma’s house and it struck me as particularly modern message for something written 40 years ago. I thought the toy-makers of today could learn a thing or two!

Lego famously had egalitarian advertising in the 1970s and 1980s, this poster is from 1981.

380,REPORT: Alleged New Audio of Michael Brown Shooting,"Mediaite writes about CNN’s morning show questioning the reporting of one of CNN’s evening shows.

Monday night, “CNN Tonight” aired an audiotape purported to capture the shooting of Michael Brown. The tape was brought to CNN by St. Louis attorney Lopa Blumenthal, (at right with anchor Don Lemon) who says a former client gave it to her. Lemon repeatedly said that CNN could not verify the authenticity of the tape.

TVNewser has learned CBS News received the same audio earlier this week from Blumenthal, but chose not to run it because it could not be verified.

This morning on “New Day,” two guests on CNN doubted the veracity of it.

“I’ve told your producers that for all I know this is something one of Howard Stern’s punk people had been doing. I look at this and my first inclination is someone is trying to punk CNN,” said former LAPD officer David Klinger. CNN analyst Tom Fuentes also doubted its authenticity: “When I heard this yesterday, I thought the exact same thing: it’s a hoax.”

WaPo’s Erik Wemple reported yesterday on how CNN got its hands on the audiotape. When asked about its authenticity, a CNN spokesperson told Wemple, “[W]e interviewed the caller’s attorney off camera and she answered key questions that gave us confidence to put her on the air live with Don. And we did confirm the caller lived close enough to the shooting to have heard the shots.”

381,"Apple Watch to Feature Time-Only 'Power Reserve' Mode, Prototypes Disguised as Samsung Watches","It appears that there may be a serious bug with the ""Reset All Settings"" option in iOS 8, causing users who activate the feature to lose all of their iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive. According to multiple posters on the MacRumors forums, using the ""Reset All Settings"" option under General --> Reset has caused documents to be permanently deleted from iCloud Drive.

Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox. They seem gone forever.The ""Reset All Settings"" option explicitly says that ""No data or media will be deleted,"" and it is meant to reset all user preferences to the default out-of-the-box settings. That the option is deleting iCloud Drive documents appears to be a serious bug, though it may be limited to Apple's own iWork apps like Pages, Keynote, and Numbers. One user had all of his iWork documents wiped by using ""Reset All Settings,"" while other app information remained in iCloud.

In our own testing, using ""Reset All Settings"" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.

There appears to be no simple way to recover iCloud Drive documents that have been erased by ""Reset All Settings"" in Yosemite, and several people who have been affected by the bug are now in contact with Apple support in an effort to retrieve their documents. A Mavericks user was, however, able to recover his files from a backup folder, and OS X Yosemite users may also have luck with recovering files via Time Machine.

One user said that Apple was waiting on engineers to investigate the issue, while another said his account had been placed in troubleshooting mode to attempt to recover the data.

Introduced with iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, iCloud Drive is Apple's answer to cloud-based storage services like Dropbox. iCloud Drive allows users to store a variety of documents like spreadsheets, PDFs, images, and more, accessing them on any device. Currently OS X Mavericks users can access iCloud Drive documents via iCloud.com, but iCloud Drive will be fully functional in October, after OS X Yosemite is released.

Users who have iCloud Drive enabled may want to refrain from using the ""Reset All Settings"" option on their devices for the time being, in order to avoid accidentally erasing important documents stored in iCloud Drive.

382,"Video showing American journalist beheaded believed real, officials and family say","James Foley went missing in November 2012

A video posted online Tuesday purportedly shows an Islamist extremist beheading James Foley, an American journalist kidnapped in Syria more than 18 months ago.

A graphic video of the purported killing, whose authenticity could not be immediately verified, was posted online Tuesday and quickly spread on social media. The video, which appears to be the work of the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria, declares the act “A Message to #America (from the #IslamicState)” and retribution for the United States’ intervention against ISIS in Iraq. Some versions of the video and Twitter accounts circulating it were quickly taken offline Tuesday evening, though the video soon appeared on YouTube again.

TIME is not publishing the video. The video also includes a threat to kill Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who has written for TIME among other outlets, and has been missing since August 2013.

A Facebook page affiliated with the Foley family’s campaign for his release posted a message Tuesday saying it couldn’t confirm the authenticity of the video or Foley’s fate.

“We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers,” the post read. “Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

A spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council said the American intelligence community “is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity.”

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said. “We will provide more information when it is available.”

Foley “was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria,” near the Turkish border, the FBI said in an alert following the Nov. 22, 2012, kidnapping. He was in Binesh covering the Syrian civil war for the GlobalPost website and AFP.

383,Report: Former Baseball Star Jose Canseco Accidentally Shot At Home,Google has bought about half of Pacific Shores office park.,unrelated
384,Luke Somers 'killed in failed rescue attempt in Yemen',"Google Inc. plans to buy about half of Redwood City's mammoth Pacific Shores Center office campus in a stunning deal that could reshuffle the Peninsula real estate scene.

Even by the standards of Google’s relentless real-estate acquisition spree, this is a big one. The world's biggest search-engine company is buying six office buildings totaling nearly a million square feet, according to several industry sources who were not willing to talk about the deal publicly. The project is owned by the Blackstone Group and Starwood Capital and managed by Equity Office.

The purchase — which could close later this month — would be Mountain View-based Google’s most dramatic real estate move this year. It opens up another front in the search giant’s rapid Peninsula expansion after big deals in Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. And it provides a potential seaborne solution to increasingly gridlocked highways: Pacific Shores is spitting distance from the Port of Redwood City, where Google has been experimenting with commuter ferries as a way to reduce the demands on its extensive bus network.

Google declined to comment. Blackstone didn’t respond to a request for comment. I’m told the sale is close to being finalized, though it’s still possible the deal could still fall through. Google's deposit isn't yet non-refundable, a customary marker for a deal headed toward the finish line, a person familiar with the transaction said.

“If any deal is done by anyone, we’d welcome them to Redwood City,” Mayor Jeffrey Gee told me in a phone call on Friday, adding that he’d wait to comment on Google’s potential arrival until a deal is complete.

Brokers said the impact of the acquisition, if completed, would ripple through the commercial real estate market. Assuming Google intends to occupy the space, tenants currently in the buildings — which are more than 90 percent leased — would have to find new space as their leases end. And Google tends to grow wherever it puts down roots.

“It adds fuel to the fire for more spec buildings to start coming out of the ground, because there’s going to be that much more pressure on space demand,” said Tim Grant, a veteran Bay Area office broker with Avison Young in Foster City.

The deal would mark another sign of tech companies taking a shine to the north Peninsula, coming just weeks after Box Inc. agreed to lease a major office project in downtown Redwood City.

“This is one more thing,” Grant said. “We’ve always been thought of as, ‘Maybe, but I’d rather be in San Francisco or (southern) Silicon Valley.’ Suddenly, the middle maybe isn’t a bad place to be.”

Google is expected to buy Blackstone and Starwood’s buildings at 1200, 1300, 1600, 1700, 1800 and 1900 Seaport Blvd., which total 934,000 square feet and are home to tenants such as Zazzle Inc. and Rocket Fuel. Google is not buying 2000 and 2100 Seaport Blvd., the owner-occupied headquarters of Informatica Corp. Nor is Google buying 1400 and 1500 Seaport Blvd., which includes DreamWorks. Those buildings are owned by Shorenstein, which has been in contract for a while to sell them to San Francisco-based investor DivcoWest, according to sources and public records.

The price Google will pay was not immediately clear, but an observer estimated it at “substantially more” than the $525 per square foot that Informatica paid for the two buildings it bought in 2012.

One of the Valley’s marquee campuses, Pacific Shores was built by Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s and broke new ground for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools, a rock-climbing wall, day spa and baseball diamonds. It was one of the first major developments that showed multiple tech companies would share the same campus, and rose taller than the one- and two-story buildings that were the standard for tech. Starwood bought the campus in 2006 for about $833 million, and immediately sold Shorenstein its two buildings. Blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years ago.

A new owner could build even more office space there, city officials said. The entire campus contains about 1.7 million square feet of office space, and new zoning approved about a year ago could allow total build-out of up to 3 million square feet.

“All things considered, there's still quite a bit of room to put more structures out there,” said Sailesh Mehra, associate city planner for the city. “You could essentially double that entire office park, if you can you could park it.”

Google — which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom — may be eyeing transit options beyond freeways. Pacific Shores is a half mile from the Port of Redwood City, where a Google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from San Francisco and Alameda to the port. The Water Emergency Transportation Authority, which administers the San Francisco Bay Ferry routes, has studied regular public ferry service to Redwood City, with a potential public terminal practically next door to Pacific Shores.

""I know they really liked the ferry and the concept. Their challenge was getting people off a boat and putting them on a bus to Mountain View, and that was taking 25 minutes,"" said Kevin Connolly, director of planning and development for WETA. ""This might be one way to address it.""

San Mateo County has about $22 million left in a sales-tax funded pot for ferry services in the county. A Redwood City terminal would cost about $15 million. But the county doesn't have ongoing operational funding, Connolly said.

A major built-in user such as Google could help make service pencil out, he said.

""If they're serious about doing it, we could do something, and there are lots of options,"" Connolly said. ""We could be very creative about working this out.""

If the deal is completed, it would probably take several years for Google to truly put its stamp on Redwood City. Tenants are in the buildings long term, and Google’s continued expansion elsewhere in Silicon Valley — it just leased another 424,000 square feet in Sunnyvale— means it’s probably not under immediate pressure to occupy the campus.

The current and future Google growth ""(is) going to impact the face of the Valley,"" Mark Bodie, a senior vice president with JLL who represents landlords, said on a market update call with media earlier this week,. ""It's really going to change the dynamics of what's available for lease.""

Mum Meng Xiangyan faced a real-life Sophie's Choice when poverty forced her to decide between her twins.

The distraught 29-year-old said that she and her husband loved both of their children.

But with certain death awaiting their daughter unless they could get medical treatment, they were prepared to sell their son to a good home so that both would have a chance of life.

Pictures published in local media show her standing on Weihai Road in Qingdao, which is a major city in eastern Shandong Province, Eastern China, with a placard offering to sell him to the highest bidder.

He was eating what appeared to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appealed for someone to come forward and buy the boy.

She said: ""Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

""But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukaemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives. It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.""

Medics say that the child is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital.

The family have sold up their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10 square metre flat close to where the therapies are being carried out. The parents are also struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal.

So far, there have been no offers on their son, who has not been named.

Their desperation follows on from a similar recent story in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband, Zhou Xinggui, are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter.

His wife's sign read: ""Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to sell my daughter and save my husband.""

386,"No, that high school kid didn't make $72 million trading stocks","Published claims that a NYC high school student made a fortune trading securities turn out to be exaggerated.

Well, here’s a creative way to make your college application stand out: Mohammed Islam, a senior at New York City’s Stuyvesant High School, has become a local celebrity with the publication of a profile in New York magazine that claims he’s made $72 million by trading stocks and other securities in between classes, homework, and extracurricular activities.

Islam, who also appeared on Business Insider‘s 20 under 20 list last year, says he has been trading stocks since he was 9, having been taught by an older cousin who now works at Goldman Sachs. Though he started off trading penny stocks, Islam says he’s made millions since then by betting on gold and crude oil futures, as well as small- and mid-cap stocks.

Depending on your perspective, this story could be read as an inspiring tale about the child of Bengali immigrants beating the odds. Or as a worrisome example of how Wolf of Wall Street-worship — along with a taste for bottle service, models, and BMWs — is corrupting our youth.

If the story is actually true — Islam told New York that his net worth is in the “high eight figures,” but it’s not clear where the $72 million figure came from and no documentation of his profits has yet appeared — it would be interesting to know a little something about his trading strategy. We’ll update if and when we hear from him; so far, Islam has not yet responded to our messages sent via Facebook.

Update: Islam has now told CNBC’s Scott Wapner that he didn’t actually make $72 million trading; that he doesn’t know where the figure came from; that he in fact has made “a few million dollars” trading; and that he is uncomfortable with the way he was portrayed in New York. “The attention is not what we expected,” he told Wapner. “We never wanted the hype.”",agree

Dan Olsen, 48, who last played a PGA Tour event at the 2011 PGA Championship, told 730AM The Game in Lansing, Mich., on Friday that ""I heard he's on a month's suspension ... it's kind of a strong witness. It's a credible person who is telling me this.''

Both the PGA Tour and Tiger Woods' agent have emphatically denied claims that he has been suspended for a month by the Tour.
Olsen, who played only one full season on the PGA Tour (2004), said an exempt tour player told him, but he would not disclose the player and couldn't say he fully believed him. He also told ESPN.com's Michael Collins on Monday that the information he got about the suspension was not first-hand.

""It's not testosterone, but it's something else,'' Olsen said. ""I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.''

Olsen also talked about Woods using a ""cheater ball,'' referring to the Nike golf ball he plays, and that those allegations were potentially more damaging than the suspension.

""I'll be looked at as just some crazy f--- nobody making accusations about Tiger,'' Olsen told ESPN.com.

Ty Votaw, the executive vice president of the PGA Tour, denied any of the claims brought forth by Olsen. 

""There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,"" Votaw said. ""We categorically deny these allegations.''

The Tour almost never comments on disciplinary matters.

Woods said on Feb. 11 that he was taking a break to deal with the issues in his game after withdrawing during the first round last month of the Farmers Insurance Open.

""Over the past year, Woods has withdrawn with an injury three times and now fallen outside of the 70 in the world.

""These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,'' said Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, in a statement. ""They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.''

If Woods failed a test for performance drugs, the PGA Tour has said it is required to announce a suspension. And it would undoubtedly be for more than a month. If he failed a test for some sort of recreational substance, the tour's policy is not to disclose any penalties.

But if the transgression were severe, a month penalty would seem minor.

The PGA Tour began testing for performance enhancing drugs in 2008 and Woods has been randomly tested like other players. Only two players have run afoul of the drug testing guidelines and both were suspended for a year.

Olsen tied for 12th at Tucson in 2004, one of only eight cuts that he made in 31 PGA Tour starts that season. He also played the Web.com Tour in 2006, finishing with two top-10s in 27 events.",discuss
389,Pentagon confirms al-Shabab leader killed in airstrike in Somalia,"The Pentagon said Friday that it had confirmed the death of a key Somali militant leader allied with al-Qaeda who had been targeted in a U.S. airstrike earlier this week.

Ahmed Abdi Godane, a co-founder of a network blamed for its brutal tactics in Somalia and for the attack on an upscale Kenyan shopping mall last year, was killed Monday in an attack carried out by U.S. drones and other aircraft, the Pentagon said.

“Removing Godane from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to al-Shabab,” Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement.

U.S. military officials had acknowledged that they were trying to kill Godane in Monday’s air assault on a Shabab compound in southern Somalia. But they had been cautious about asserting the mission was successful, mindful of reports of other al-Qaeda leaders who had been killed in drone attacks, only to resurface later.

The State Department had offered a $7 million reward for information leading to Godane’s arrest. It identified him as a 37-year-old native of northern Somalia who, among other aliases, went by the names Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr and Ahmed Abdi Aw Mohamed.

Monday’s drone strike was the most aggressive U.S. military operation in Somalia in nearly a year, and it came as the Obama administration was already grappling with security crises in Iraq, Syria and Ukraine.

Counterterrorism officials and analysts have described Godane as a particularly ruthless jihadi leader who eliminated several rivals within al-Shabab, either by killing them or forcing them to go underground.

It was unclear who might succeed him as leader of the network. Although al-Shabab often posts comments from the group on social media and gives interviews with journalists in Somalia, it has been mum about whether he survived the airstrike.",agree

Libyan terrorists have posted pictures of themselves online posing with some of the aeroplanes taken from Tripoli airport after fighters seized it last month.

Soldiers from the group Libyan Dawn can be seen climbing on to the wings of commercial jets while smiling and waving for the camera.

U.S. officials fear that these aeroplanes could now be used to carry out 9/11-style attacks in the region on the anniversary of the tragedy this month.

A total of 11 commercial jets from state-owned carriers Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways went missing in August after militants from the so-called 'masked men brigade' overran the airport.

Tripoli airport was left as little more than a smouldering ruin after rebels seized control of it in August

Officials have been warning for some time about the deteriorating situation in Libya, which was controlled by dictator Muammar Gaddaffi until he was killed in October 2011.

'There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,' one official told the Washington Free-Beacon. 'We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.'

September 11 not only marks the anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center but it will also be the second anniversary of the raid of the U.S. Ambassador's compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Four Americans were killed in the attack, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

Ansar al-Shariah, the group Washington holds responsible for the attack, have also seized parts of the Libyan capital and are known to work with terrorists from ISIS.

However they are not thought to be working with fighters from Libyan Dawn, as they are an Al-Qaeda affiliated group.

Tripoli International Airport was being run by two anti-Islamist militias and had been closed since mid-July when it was taken over at the end of August by the group Libyan Dawn.

Pictures show the aftermath of the firefight, with planes completely or partially blasted and several littered with bullet holes.

Tripoli is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gaddaffi left power. The militias, many of which originate from rebel forces that fought Gaddaffi, became powerful players in post-war Libya, filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army.

Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order, but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped-for transition to democracy.

On Sunday, the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital.

Ansar al-Sharia has ties to the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), the Syrian group which today released the filmed beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff - the second recorded execution of a U.S. hostage by the group.

Fears: Nearly a dozen commercial planes are missing in Libya after a radical Islamic group overtook the international airport in the capital of Tripoli late last month.

Aftermath: Tripoli International Airport was overtaken by the group Libyan Dawn last month and now 11 aircraft for Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways are missing

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui told Al Jazeera television after the airport attack that the planes had been taken by another Islamic group, the Masked Men Brigade.

Mekkaoui said there is 'credible intelligence' that the Masked Men Brigade 'is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the Maghreb state' on the 9/11 anniversary.

Sebastian Gorka, a counterterrorism expert, told the Free-Beacon that the planes could be used in two ways to strike North Africa or even as far as the oil fields of Saudi Arabia.

'The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,' Gorka, the Maj Gen Charles Horner chair at the Marine Corps University, said.

'The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,' he added.

U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the eleven planes' disappearance, but are reportedly working to track them down.

392,This Is Why Rumors That ISIS Is Crossing The Border Into The U.S. Aren’t Going Away,"WASHINGTON -- Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson shot down claims on Thursday that a ""porous"" U.S. southern border is allowing terrorists, Ebola and a surge of unaccompanied minors into the country, despite claims to the contrary by some politicians.

Johnson tried to dispel rumors and dial back fears during a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, saying there have been improvements to border security. He said the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended in fiscal year 2014 was 68,434 -- considerably lower than a projection of 90,000. Claims that four terrorists had crossed the border were false, he said, and the government is intensifying efforts to keep Ebola out of the U.S.

But that's not always what people are hearing from politicians or reading in the news, he said.

""Those of us in public office, and in the media –- whether in describing the border, ISIL or Ebola -- owe the public informed, careful, and responsible dialogue, not overheated rhetoric that is certain to feed the flames of fear, anxiety and suspicion,"" Johnson said. ISIL, the terrorist group that calls itself the Islamic State, also is called ISIS.

Recent criticism of the Obama administration over border security has stoked fears over ISIS and Ebola, particularly by Republicans campaigning for November elections. Former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.), now running for Senate in New Hampshire, said on Thursday that the border needed to be secured to prevent the spread of diseases into the country. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) said Tuesday that ""at least"" 10 members of the Islamic State were apprehended crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, a claim DHS said was false. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has said that four men with ties to terrorism were apprehended along the border.

Johnson said the four individuals were investigated and found to be members of the Kurdish Worker's Party, which he said ""is actually fighting against ISIL and defended Kurdish territory in Iraq."" The men remain in detention for unlawful entry, he said. (Chaffetz, for his part, continued to maintain after Johnson's speech that the men are terrorists, according to interview with CBS News.)

On Ebola, Johnson said the government is ""heavily engaged"" and is ""enhancing our Ebola screening of air passengers from the three affected African countries, and we are continually evaluating whether more is appropriate.""

""We very definitely in this country have the capability to deal with the Ebola virus,"" he said.

Johnson touted border security improvements, but said DHS was still working to improve policies on transparency and internal agency coordination. One change in DHS policy, however, has been receiving considerable pushback from immigration advocates: the increased practice of holding families in detention. The government has expanded facilities for detaining families -- largely mothers with children, many of them seeking asylum -- over the past few months, and plans to add more space.

Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which has been critical of family detention, asked Johnson during a question and answer period after the speech why the government is expanding family detention when many of the women and children being held are seeking asylum and have fled horrific violence.

Johnson said that given the increase this year in families crossing the border -- even though the numbers have dropped recently -- DHS needed to make sure it could detain them.

""We believe it's necessary to build more of that capability in the event we have another spike like we had last summer,"" he said.

Although Johnson acknowledged the influx of migrants over the past year was a ""setback,"" he said there have been improvements in border security, from more resources focused on patrol to fewer border-crossings.

""In recent years, the total number of those who attempt to cross our southwest border has declined dramatically, while the percentage of those who are apprehended has gone up,"" he said. ""Put simply, it’s now much harder to cross our border and evade capture than it used to be -– and people know that.""",discuss
393,Nicaragua meteorite: Experts attempt to understand whether mysterious meteorite fell from passing Pitbull asteroid,"Experts do not know whether the meteorite disintegrated on impact or shot into the ground

Kashmira Gander writes for the Independent and Independent on Sunday

Monday 08 September 2014

Experts from across the world are attempting to understand whether a mysterious bang heard in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua on Saturday night was caused by a meteorite which broke off from a passing asteroid.

Baffled residents of the Central American city told reporters that they heard a loud boom at around 11pm, but did not see anything shoot across the sky. Meanwhile, scientists are uncertain whether the now missing rock disintegrated or shot deep into the ground.

""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria told reporters.

Jose Millan, from the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter), said residents of the capital had made a lucky escape as no one was injured.

""We need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population,"" he said.

A committee formed to investigate the incident have confirmed that the noise was caused by a “relatively small” meteorite that fell from an asteroid passing close to Earth, said Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo.

She added that international experts have been called upon to help local scientists understand the situation and its possible links to the ""Pitbull"" asteroid.

Meanwhile, Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the institute of territorial studies, said it was ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light.""

""We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something,"" he said.

A Nicaraguan soldier checking the crater  The meteorite left a crater with a radius 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet near Managua's international airport and an air force base, said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan institute of territorial studies who took part in the investigation.

It is yet unclear whether the meteorite disintegrated on impact or became buried, he added.

Humberto Garcia, of the astronomy centre at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to Pitbull.

""We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,"" he said.

Two Nicaraguan soldiers guard the crater  Meanwhile, British scientist Dr Dan Brown said he agreed that the crater may be linked to the Pitbull, or 2014 RC, asteroid, but said this was not the only solution.

The astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, said: “Although the impact occurred roughly 12 hours before the asteroid passed Earth, that part of the planet was facing in the right direction for it to have been a fragment associated with it.

""If it was an unrelated object, however, then it further demonstrates how we don't really monitor all the potentially dangerous rocks out there,"" he suggested.

Echoing the confusion of Nicaraguan residents and experts, he continued: ""It certainly makes absolute sense that people surrounding the impact site heard a loud boom - but a flash of light or bright object should also have been observed before that.

""Further analysis will hopefully help to establish this and possibly give a better indication of the object's trajectory. It is still to be seen if any material of the meteorite can be recovered.

""Both pieces of evidence would make it possible to link it to 2014 RC and help us understand more about asteroids,"" he said.

394,"Cook said to confirm Apple Watch is showerproof, lasts a day","Claim: Deandre Joshua was murdered after testifying before a grand jury in Ferguson.

FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, December 2014]

Deandre Joshua, 20 was murdered after testifying to a grand jury in the ferguson, MO case. Supposedly he was found not far from where Brown's body was & he was covered in lighter fluid. It was a post I saw on FB & just wondered if it was true.

Origins: Shortly after a 20-year-old man named Deandre Joshua was killed in Ferguson, Missouri, on 24 November 2014, rumors started circulating around the Internet connecting the young man's murder to the non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson in the controversial shooting death of Michael Brown.

The details of Joshua's death are gruesome. According to the Washington Post, Deandre was shot once in the head and then burned inside his car. The incident occurred on the same night protesters took to the streets of Ferguson to protest the grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson. These circumstances, coupled with the fact that Joshua was a friend of Dorian Johnson, who was with Mike Brown on the night of his death, led many to believe Joshua's murder was in some way connected to Wilson's non-indictment:

This is Deandre Joshua. This 20 year old man testified in the Grand Jury case against Darren Wilson. He was shot and killed on Tuesday. His body was found, with lighter fluid all over it, not far from where Darren Wilson killed Michael Brown. Why are broken windows on the front page of our news, and not his face?

However, there is no documentation Deandre Joshua testified before the grand jury. According to the Boston Globe , names of the witnesses were kept secret, and anyone who disclosed that information would face a misdemeanor charge. Additionally, Joshua's family and friends told the New York Times he was nowhere near the scene when Mike Brown was shot and killed, and prosecutors confirmed he was not a grand jury witness:

According to family members, friends and law-enforcement officials, however, Joshua was nowhere near Canfield Drive when Brown was killed during a confrontation with Wilson on Aug. 9 and couldn't have witnessed the shooting. And McCulloch's office, which remained tight-lipped about the Wilson investigation, confirmed that Joshua didn't offer testimony during the proceedings.

""He was not a witness,"" said Ed Magee, a spokesman for the county prosecutor.

Deandre Joshua did not witness the shooting of Michael Brown, nor did he testify before the grand jury. The only connection that Joshua had to the case was that he was a childhood friend of Dorian Johnson (who did witness the shooting):

As of 2 December 2014, Deandre Joshua's death is still under investigation by police. It is unclear who killed Joshua or why they did so, but it is clear is Joshua's death was not retaliation for grand jury testimony in the Brown case.""

395,Mum Offers to Sell Twin Boy to Save Twin Girl,"THIS is the terrible moment a desperately poor young woman tries to sell her son – to fund life-saving treatment for her daughter.

Mum Meng Xiangyan faced a real-life Sophie's Choice when poverty forced her to decide between her twins.

The distraught 29-year-old said that she and her husband loved both of their children.

But with certain death awaiting their daughter unless they could get medical treatment, they were prepared to sell their son to a good home so that both would have a chance of life.

Pictures published in local media show her standing on Weihai Road in Qingdao, which is a major city in eastern Shandong Province, Eastern China, with a placard offering to sell him to the highest bidder.

He was eating what appeared to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appealed for someone to come forward and buy the boy.

She said: ""Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

""But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukaemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives. It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.""

Medics say that the child is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital.

The family have sold up their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10 square metre flat close to where the therapies are being carried out. The parents are also struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal.

So far, there have been no offers on their son, who has not been named.

Their desperation follows on from a similar recent story in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband, Zhou Xinggui, are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter.

His wife's sign read: ""Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to sell my daughter and save my husband.""

In the four hours she sat with the sign, no-one bought her daughter.",agree

Americans Believe ISIS May 'Attack the US Soon'; ISIS Demands $1 Million for James Foley Remains

According to a British military expert who has just returned from Iraq, ISIS has improvised a new weapon by putting live scorpions inside bomb canisters. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former British army and NATO head of chemical and biological weapons revealed that ISIS has thought of a new way to spread terror. He described it as ""madness"" and said ISIS promotes the use of scorpion bombs to create panic.

De Bretton-Gordon explained that scorpions are ""robust"" as the creatures can survive the impact of a launch even from a couple of miles. When the canisters break, thousands of scorpions will ""start crawling all around,"" the Mirror reported. Although not all scorpions are poisonous, the military expert said ISIS mainly wants to incite fear. The 2-ft scorpion bombs are not meant for mass casualties but are devised for maximum ""psychological impact.""

De Bretton-Gordon had returned from Baghdad last week where he took an advisory role to train Iraqi forces fighting ISIS militants. Senior officials in Iraq have reported that the scorpions were being used against civilian targets in the northern part of the country. Officials said the use of scorpions as weapons dates back to 198 AD when the creatures were stuffed into pots and thrown to enemies.

Meanwhile, ISIS militants in Mosul are preparing for an attack from the Iraqi government forces as they cut off telephone lines and imposed a ban on residents to leave the city. The Daily Telegraph was told that conditions in the city have deteriorated since ISIS is under constant pressure to fight back Iraqi ground troops.

A resident in Mosul revealed ISIS has imposed a rule that residents have to follow or else face punishment. The militants have warned residents to secure a guarantor if they wish to leave the city and come back after a few days. The Mosul resident, who asked not to be named, said people in the Iraqi city are trying to leave. Hospitals have shut down operations since there is no water or electricity.

U.S.-led coalition forces continue to launch airstrikes on ISIS targets as President Barack Obama has vowed that there will be ""no safe haven"" for ISIS.

397,Cold Turkey,"There it was in the middle of a field, baking in the sun: a cache of grenades, rockets and guns. The trove was attached to a big black parachute and, as the camera focused in on the shipment, it seemed for a moment abandoned. Then you see the masked man, who sermonized for the occasion. An American airdrop of arms, he said, which had been intended for Kurdish fighters defending the city of Kobane, had fallen into the hands of the Islamic State.

“These are some of the American aid [items] that were dropped for the atheists in the” Kurdistan Workers’ Party,” the militant said in a video uploaded to jihadist social media accounts and initially reported by SITE Intelligence Group. “Ammunition, military equipment, additional equipment — these are some of the military weapons. The American forces dropped [them] … Praise be to Allah. Spoils for the mujahideen.”

News of the accidental airdrop, which the Associated Press corroborated and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed, brought fresh criticism to a military tactic — the air drop — officials said has become substantially more accurate in the past few decades, but is still evidently prone to screw-ups. And those screw-ups have popped up several times so far in the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, underscoring the dangers of trusting the winds to carry valuable resources to their targets.

In early August, the U.S. military dropped more than 7,000 gallons of water and 36,000 packaged meals onto a barren mountain near Sinjar, the hiding spot for nearly 40,000 Yazidis who fled the Islamic State under threat of genocide. Many packages reached their intended targets — the Department of Defense estimated 80 percent — but not all of them did. “Iraqi officials said that much of the U.S. aid had been ‘useless’ because it was dropped from 15,000 feet without parachutes and exploded on impact,” wrote journalist Jonathan Krohn, who claimed to be the first Western journalist on the scene. The Washington Post’s Liz Sly agreed, saying the drops “apparently went awry.”

Then NBC News reported late last month Iraqi military pilots accidentally dropped food, water and weapons to Islamic State fighters instead of to their own soldiers, who were battling to retain control of Anbar province. “Some pilots, instead of dropping these supplies over the area of the Iraqi army, threw it over an area that is controlled by ISIS fighters,” Hakim al-Zamili said, using another name for the Islamic State. “Those soldiers were in deadly need of these supplies, but because of the wrong plans of the commanders in the Iraqi army and lack of experience of the pilots, we in a way or another helped ISIS fighters to kill our soldiers.”

Another general sheepishly added: “Yes, that’s what had happened.”

The embarrassing anecdotes feed into the complicated history of the airdrop, which still carries risks despite being honed over decades with technological advancements such as GPS-guided parachutes. “There’s no way you can predict who may end up with those weapons, and who is going to use them, or how they are going to use them,” Greg Myre of the Middle East Institute told the Daily Sabah. “That is one of the risks you have to take.”

It was a risk Bill Clinton was willing to take in 1993. That was the year he ordered an airdrop of tens of thousands of humanitarian packages over eastern Bosnia, despite the “military consistently arguing against involving U.S. troops in airdrops in hostile zones, given the fact that the accuracy of the drops is questionable,” the Associated Press then reported. The brass turned out to be right.

One major problem laid bare during that mission, military scientists later said, was what they called “wind drift.” “The problem was identified in the late ’90s,” John McGinley, a scientist who researched the topic, told The Washington Post’s Holly Watt in 2008. “The terrain in Bosnia meant that instead of landing in one valley, the cargo could drift into another valley that was held by the enemy. Wind drift was causing all the problems.”

So research teams got to work, ultimately unveiling wind-forecast software that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said increased the drop’s accuracy by 70 percent. “Inaccurate wind forecasts are the main culprit in missed targets for dropping supplies and other items from high altitudes,” the report said.

It almost immediately went into use in the war in Afghanistan, where far-flung military outposts were separated by stretches of roads pockmarked with insurgents and explosives. There had to be another way to get soldiers the equipment they needed, military officials thought, so they launched a massive increase in airdrops. “We’ve gotten a lot more accurate over the years,” Air Force Gen. Arthur Lichte told USA Today.

That may true. But following this week’s alleged delivery to the Islamic State, there’s clearly still room for work.",agree

399,ISIS Appears To Behead American Photojournalist In YouTube Video,"Actual women.

With ongoing outrage over the NFL's recent slew of scandals, it made perfect sense when ESPN announced it will hold a panel on domestic violence Monday night. But as the two organizations geared up this discussion about women and abuse in the world of sports, it quickly became painfully clear that women had been completely excluded from the table. 

As Esquire's Ben Collins pointed out last week, the panel will consist entirely of male commentators, while female reporters will be literally sidelined in the discussion.

""Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24,"" Collins wrote.

""When the show has updates from the field — brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game — they'll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber. These people are not allowed at the table.""

What an oversight. The utter failure to include a single woman in a discussion about domestic violence has already attracted a ton of criticism online:






But that's not all. While it might be easy to dismiss an incident like this as unintentional, Collins rightly points out that ESPN's track record on holding the NFL accountable is not that great. And why should it be, given the lucrative, multibillion-dollar partnership the two organizations enjoy?

""You will not hear these words because ESPN is not a company in the business of journalism. It is an entertainment outlet that sometimes reports convenient, timely information to drive interest in future programming,"" Collins writes. ""There are 11 seats at the table at ESPN. All of them go to men. Women get their own table, but only sometimes — and ESPN has placed that table where no one can hear them.""

The report claims that Apple Stores will accept in-store reservations for customers to try on the Apple Watch and corroborates that Apple is training its retail employees to help customers choose an Apple Watch model that suits them best.

The report, citing sources familiar with the matter, adds that the high-end Apple Watch Edition will have scratch-resistant gold, which an in-depth analysis over the weekend revealed is because Apple mixes the metal with low-density ceramic particles. Apple is also said to have studied a platinum Apple Watch, but the model is unlikely to be announced Monday.""The company has refined the smartwatch’s luxury features, making the gold in the Edition model scratch-resistant, according to people familiar with the matter,"" reports The Wall Street Journal. ""It also has studied platinum watch casings, although the company isn’t expected to announce that on Monday, they said.""Apple CEO Tim Cook, during a visit to the Covent Garden Apple Store in London last month, told retail employees that Apple has ""never sold anything as a company that people could try on before."" The chief executive added that ""tweaking the experience in the store"" will likely be a requirement when the wrist-worn device launches in April. It also appears likely that the Apple Watch will be exclusive to Apple Stores immediately following the product's launch, although for how long remains unknown.

Two MPs tweeted that the gunman has been killed by police.

The attack came a day after a 25-year-old Muslim convert was shot dead by police after he killed a Canadian solider and injured a second near Montreal.

Police said the man, Martin Couture Rouleau had recently become influenced by radical Islam, with friends suggesting he acted in response to an appeal by the Isis (Islamic State) group for jihadi sympathisers across the world to launch 'lone wolf' attacks on westerners ""wherever they can be found"".

403,"Mass Graves Found In Mexico, Near Place Where 43 Students Went Missing","But an official says it would be ""irresponsible"" to identify the bodies as the missing students

A mass grave with an unconfirmed number of bodies was discovered in a part of Mexico near to where 43 college students were abducted, authorities announced Saturday night.

Guerrero State Attorney General Iñaky Blanco said there was a connection between the burial site and the students’ disappearance from a teachers’ college the previous weekend, the Wall Street Journal reports. However, Blanco said it would be “irresponsible” without DNA tests to confirm that the bodies were the missing students.

Mexico’s Proceso, citing anonymous sources, reported that 20 bodies had been discovered. The Associated Press reports that six pits had been discovered but did not report a body count.

The students disappeared after clashing with police during a protest that turned violent. Officials have detained 30 people, including 22 police officers, in the case. Blanco said that a local criminal organization, Los Guerreros Unidos, was connected with the violence and the disappearances.

Close to 100,000 Mexicans have been killed or gone missing in drug-related violence since 2006, when former President Felipe Calderon ordered the country’s military to reclaim parts of the country under the influence of drug cartels.

But that's what happened Thursday to one Ann Arbor driver who delivered a single pizza to a conference room full of more than 200 realtors from Michigan and northern Ohio on Thursday.

Pizza House delivery manager Brian LeFevre said he received a call Thursday morning from a man who said they wanted one pizza delivered to the Sheraton Hotel in Ann Arbor.

""They said they wanted it at 2:20 p.m. on the dot,"" LeFevre said. ""I gave it to our delivery driver and he went down there and took it to the front desk.""

LeFevre said his driver was escorted to a conference room where a man was up front with a microphone.

A video posted on YouTube shows the deliverer being stopped as he handed over the pizza and then presented with $2,084, letters of encouragement, a Visa gift card and lottery tickets -- all to cheers from the crowd. LeFevre said the driver, who identifies himself as Rob in the video but whose last name wasn't released, has worked at the restaurant about six years.

When he came back, LeFevre said, Rob was visibly happy.

""He was clearly pretty ecstatic about something so I asked him what's going on,"" Le said. ""He said, 'I just had a life-changing delivery.' He was kind of blown away.""

LeFevre said he's never seen a driver earn such a large tip.

""For one pizza, that's a pretty good day's work,"" he said. ""It's nice to be appreciated.""

Stacey McVey, team leader of Keller Williams Greater Cleveland West, said that at the company's annual conference, all the agents agreed to pitch in to show someone from the service industry their appreciation.

411,New policy could reduce marijuana possession arrests,"Robots are increasingly replacing humans in a variety of mundane tasks, like bolting a car together or making lollipops, but now they are moving into the security business.

Microsoft recently installed a fleet of 5-feet-tall, 300-pound robots to protect its Silicon Valley campus. The robots are packed with HD security cameras and sensors to take in their organic, protein-based surroundings. There’s also an artificial intelligence on board that can sound alarms when the robot notices something awry. It can also read license plates and cross-reference them to see if they’re stolen.

The K5 robots come from a California company called Knightscope, which calls the robots “autonomous data machines” that provide a “commanding but friendly presence.” Sounds like something a robot manufacturer would say.

Let’s be honest though, the robots look pretty damn cool. They’re like modern versions of R2-D2.

Thankfully—or sadly, depending on how you look at it—the K5 robots don’t have any weapons on them. All they can do is assess a situation, sound an alarm to defuse it, or call a human security officer to the scene. There are, however, plans equip the robots with tasers sometime in the future.

Microsoft’s new protectors are fairly autonomous. A single charge will last 24 hours, and if the robot notices that its battery is getting low, it will return to a charging port and plug itself in. It can fully recharge in 20 minutes, which is pretty insane.

There are plans to one day expand the use of Knightscope’s robots and have them patrol the streets as part of human police units. We can’t even imagine what would happen if Elon Musk heard about this.

412,Eyewitness Says Viral Video of Homeless Man Was Staged,"New audio has surfaced that allegedly captures the moment when Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot dead by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, on Aug. 9.

CNN aired the unverified recording on Monday night. Six shots can be heard, followed by a pause, then several more. A private autopsy performed on Aug. 17 at the request of Brown's family found that the 18-year-old was shot 6 times, including twice in the head.

A man who lives near the scene of the shooting says he inadvertently recorded the shots that killed Brown, his lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN. The man, who wished to remain unidentified, was recording a video chat with a friend when gunfire rang out in the background. Blumenthal said her client has already been interviewed by the FBI about the recording.

Brown was shot on Aug. 9 after he and a friend, Dorian Johnson, were walking in the street and were stopped by Wilson. Johnson, said that Wilson attacked Brown, then shot at the 18-year-old as he was trying to get away. Ferguson Police claim that Brown attacked Wilson, and said that Wilson was injured after the altercation. Multiple witnesses have said that they saw Brown with his hands up in the air when he was shot.

Police released footage on Aug. 15 that they said showed Brown robbing a convenience store for cigarillos. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that Wilson was not aware that Brown was a suspect in a robbery when he stopped the teen, though Jackson later said that Wilson ""made the connection"" during the course of the stop. The family's attorney accused police of trying to ""assassinate the character of Michael Brown"" to divert attention from his death.",unrelated
413,This Soap Opera Star Reportedly Had His Testicles Stolen By An ‘Attractive Blonde’ Organ Trafficker,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Research Medical Center is waiting for test results after concern that a patient might have a contagious disease.  The hospital says some local reports that the patient has Ebola are false.

Research Medical Center says that patient came to its Brookside campus emergency department Saturday for treatment.

“Somebody went to an ER with a high fever and a history of having recently been to Nigeria,” said Jeff Hershberger, the spokesman for the KCMO Health Department.

He says because Ebola is so high-profile right now, they don’t want to rule it out quite yet.

“The patient has been isolated, however, at this point, because there’s been no development of new symptoms, it’s highly unlike that Ebola is the diagnosis,” added Hershberger.

According to a statement from Research Medical Center, like hospitals across the United States, it has standard infectious disease precautions and is well-equipped and well-prepared to implement them as necessary.

“There’s a wide umbrella of things that it could be,” Hershberger said, “We want to make sure, looking at that entire umbrella, that we are not ignoring something.”

The hospital does not believe the patient has Ebola, and says the patient is being treated for another illness. Hershberger says regardless, Ebola should not be a big concern.

“It’s very unlikely they will even be exposed to it, let alone contract it,” Hershberger said, “You cannot catch Ebola unless you touch the bodily fluids of somebody who has Ebola.”

The health department says it should know the patient’s diagnosis by Monday. It also says that Research Medical Center is taking the appropriate steps when it comes to dealing with infectious diseases.",unrelated
414,Seth Rogen to Star as Steve Wozniak in Sony's Steve Jobs Biopic [Updated],"CHILPANCINGO, Mexico (AP) — Authorities testing remains found in nine mass graves in southern Mexico have yet to find any of 43 teachers college students who disappeared after a confrontation with police, security officials said Tuesday.

None were among 28 bodies, some badly burned, that were unearthed a week after the Sept. 26 attack, Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said.

Forensic investigators continued to test other remains and announced the discovery of 10th mass grave Tuesday.

Relatives of missing students march with flowers and candles to protest the disappearance of 43 students from the Isidro Burgos rural teachers college in Chilpancingo, Mexico, Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2014. According to Mexico's attorney general none of the missing students were among the bodies found in the first set of mass graves outside the town. Authorities have said police involved in ""disappearing"" the students were working in conjunction with a local drug gang. (AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo)

An additional 14 police officers have been arrested and confessed to participating in the disappearance, Murillo Karam said, bringing the total number of detainees to 50.

The 14 are from the police force of Cocula, a town neighboring Iguala, where the confrontation took place in the southern state of Guerrero. Both the mayor and police chief of Iguala are fugitives and accused of links to the local drug cartel, Guerrero Unidos, believed to have worked with police in disappearing the students.

The gang controls drug routes in Guerrero and Morelos states.

Murillo Karam said that officials had yet to identify the masterminds or a motive in the attack, but that the collusion might have gone beyond just one town.

""There's a connection. We will determine if it was coordination or subordination, but it's clear to me that they were working together,"" he said of police and drug traffickers in the area.

Police opened fire on about 100 students who had hijacked buses to return to campus after arriving in Iguala to pass the hat for their school. Teachers college students are known throughout Mexico for using radical tactics to raise money and spread their leftist philosophy.

Six people were killed, 25 wounded and dozens of students rounded up by police. There has been no sign of the missing in nearly three weeks, leading investigators to comb the clandestine burial sites outside of Iguala, where drug cartels are believed to dump their enemies.

On Tuesday, Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre said many of the bodies at the first site appeared to have been buried for some time, suggesting they belonged to earlier victims of criminal gangs.

""Some of them are not recent, some are from months ago,"" Aguirre told MVS radio.

One forensic expert, who works with federal investigators, said identification is an arduous process that takes time. Charred remains like those recovered at the first mass graves can leave very little DNA for testing.

""If a bone is burned at more than 300 degrees, it's almost impossible to identify because the collagen is burned. Because of that, criminal organizations started to adopt that technique,"" said Jorge Arturo Talavera, head of the bio-archaeology team at the Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History.

He said the way the remains are exhumed also can affect identification. If they're pulled out in a hurried manner, other identifying articles like jewelry or teeth get discarded.

Hundreds of teachers, students and relatives of the missing marched to the center of the state capital, Chilpancingo, on Tuesday, taking a much more solemn tone after a night of angry protests and vandalism that badly damaged the state capital building.

They lined up in silence as organizers passed out white flowers. Some carried candles with a sprawling billboard offering a 1 million peso ($75,000) reward for information.

On Monday, protesters demanding to know the whereabouts of the missing smashed windows at the state capital building complex in Chilpancingo, 132 miles (212 kilometers) south of Mexico City, and set fire to some of the buildings.

Students from the school and local teachers blockaded the capital complex, pelting it with sticks, rocks and Molotov cocktails. The finance secretary of Guerrero state said six buildings were affected.

Also Tuesday, an alleged leader of the Guerreros Unidos killed himself during a confrontation with Mexican security forces Tuesday. Federal forces were carrying out an operation to capture Benjamin Mondragon, or ""Benjamon,"" when a gunbattle broke out, National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido said.

Mondragon killed himself as he was about to be arrested, Rubido said, though he had no details on how.

The official said it was unclear whether Mondragon was involved in the students' disappearances.

President Enrique Pena Nieto said the disappearances ""are without doubt a topic that will lead the Mexican government at all levels to take actions that will prevent events like those in Iguala from ever occurring again."" He said the government ""will strengthen institutions, especially those involved in law enforcement, so that they act with greater reliability and efficiency.""

417,ISIS cracks down on five confirmed Ebola cases among fighters: official,"A hallucinogenic fungi has been found growing in the Queen’s garden at Buckingham Palace after being discovered by gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh.

The television presenter unearthed the fungi at Buckingham Palace for an ITV gardening show called The Queen’s Garden, and said: “I won’t be eating any of that.”

Titchmarsh came across the red and white spotted toadstool — called Amanita muscaria, or fly agaric — on a tour of the private 40-acre plot with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley.

Titchmarsh, 65, asks in an ITV show to be screened on Christmas Day: “Is it edible?”

Professor Crawley replies: “That depends what you mean. It’s eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic affects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

“The old-fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness.”

Titchmarsh jokingly replies: “I think I’ll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms.”

Then he adds: “Not something to try at home.”

Later he told The Sun newspaper: “That was a surprise but it shows just how varied the species are. I won’t be eating any of that, though, no. My idea of hard drugs is Nurofen.”

On the new TV show, Titchmarsh explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools.

He says: “Every time they chop something down, they leave out the wood to rot.”

Magic mushroom is a slang term for any hallucinogenic fungus.

The most common, illegal form contains drug psilocybin, but there is no suggestion this grows in the Palace garden.

Last night a Palace spokesman told the Sun: “For the avoidance of doubt, fungi from the garden are not used in the Palace kitchens.”

The new programme will show viewers an entire year in the life of the Buckingham Palace garden, from the summer garden parties to the nocturnal wanderings of wildlife in the heart of London.

It will demonstrate how gardeners work tirelessly to maintain the Queen’s flowers, while bearing in mind her wish to see animals and insects made welcome in the gardens, swapping pesticides for homemade garlic treatments.

Titchmarsh will explore how bee hives, homes for insects and deposits from the Royal mews each help cultivate the gardens of Buckingham Palace, with top tips from gardeners giving insight into the Queen’s own tastes.

The programme, to be broadcast by ITV on Christmas Day, will also show how the garden has been used by the royal family for generations, from the king who planted mulberry trees to rival the French to the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret climbing to peer over the high garden walls.

A sandpit used by the royal children will be filmed, along with oak trees planted decades ago by the young Prince of Wales and Princess Royal, grown from acorns sown on the event of their birth.

Titchmarsh, who spent 12 months exploring how the Palace garden changed with the seasons, will be seen finishing the calendar year with a Christmas tree mounted in the Marble Hall, decorated with holly and mistletoe from the royal garden and festooned with festive golden crowns.",unrelated

The internet has been salivating at the prospect of getting stoned and eating fried chicken this week, after reports circulated that KFC is to become a marijuana dispensary as well as a restaurant.

A story on Racket Report claimed that with tax revenue from sales of the drug being so high in Colorado, KFC wanted a piece of the action, with the added benefit that its chicken would see a boost in sales thanks to the munchies.

It looks to be false for several reasons however:

- Racket Report has carried a lot of hoax stories in the past

- KFC hasn't mentioned marijuana on its official news page

- Marijuana sales are currently cash only which would make things tricky for the chain

- Marijuana is still in somewhat of a legal grey area and probably not crystal clear enough for a giant brand to start slinging it

- KFC doesn't even sell alcohol, so they'd really be jumping in at the deep end

While weed might not be hitting KFC any time soon, with sweeping legalisation in the US this sort of thing is inevitable.

“When I heard this yesterday, I thought the exact same thing: it’s a hoax,” Fuetnes said, explaining:

“The engineers in the laboratory at Quantico will be trying to determine if there was a dubbing; did we have an original recording of this guy having a conversation no one wants to talk about, and then the shots then dubbed over it; was it the complete tape? All accounts from Brown’s side and the officer’s side say there was a single shot fired initially at the door of the police car. So that shot, followed by Brown trying to flee, and then the officer exiting the car and pursuing him and then firing the series of shots — so we’re missing that first shot. Now, I don’t know, CNN got this tape first. Did they censor it because the guy said something obscene over the first shot and they didn’t want to air that? We just don’t know all that.”

New Day cohost Michaela Pereira defended the airing of the tape. “It needs to be said the lawyer who is representing the man who gave us the audio gave it to us, she swears it is real,” Pereira said. “We have no reason here at CNN to believe that it’s not true.”

420,Islamic State reports youngest jihadist 'martyred' in battle,"“A Message To America,” a video uploaded Tuesday to YouTube, begins with a clip of President Obama announcing his recent authorization of targeted airstrikes and a humanitarian operation in Iraq. Then, around the two minute mark, a man believed to be James Wright Foley, 40, delivers a statement:

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers: the U.S. government,” he says, before specifically addressing his brother John, a member of the U.S. Air Force. (A full transcript of his last words was posted online by the blogger Brown Moses and can be found here.)

About two minutes and 20 seconds later, the man is apparently beheaded. His executioner, whose face is covered, has what sounds like a British accent and threatens that “any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.”

Two people who know Foley said the man in the video appears to be him, and that the voice sounds like his. A Facebook page that is part of the Foley family’s appeal to find and bring Foley home posted the following statement: “We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

Foley, a freelance photojournalist for the AFP and GlobalPost, and his translator were kidnapped in Binesh, Syria, in November 2012. According to the FBI, his translator was later released.

The propaganda video ends with a shot of another kneeling man in orange believed to be missing journalist Steven Sotloff. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the executioner says.

A version of the clip viewed by BuzzFeed was removed from YouTube after about 20 minutes, though others have been uploaded since.

“YouTube has clear policies that prohibit content like gratuitous violence, hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts, and we remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users,” a spokesperson for YouTube said. “We also terminate any account registered by a member of a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization and used in an official capacity to further its interests.”

“We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL,” said NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden. “The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

421,"‘Teletubbies’ Sun Baby: Fans Freak Out Over Jess Smith, 19","A video that appears to a show a bird pooping on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s suit during a speech last week is fake.

The video–uploaded to YouTube–is going viral. A few media outlets appear to have been tricked by it. The video is titled: “Bird pooped on Putin at opening of WWI monument.”

The Washington Post and TIME magazine both posted the video, apparently believing it.

The Post issued a correction, saying that “a bird did not defecate on Russian President Vladimir Putin during a speech on Friday. The video appears to have been a hoax.”

TIME wrote: “A video shared online made it seem as if Vladimir Putin got some unwelcome love from a feathered friend Sunday during a speech unveiling a monument to Russians who served in World War I.”

It later updated the post, saying that “The Independent reveals this video to have been falsely doctored to show a bird defecating on Putin.”

The Associated Press update:

Obama, Putin discuss Ukraine, missile treaty

WASHINGTON (AP) — Capping a week of aggressive action against Russia, President Barack Obama pressed Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday for a diplomatic path out of Ukraine’s struggle with Moscow-backed pro-Russian separatists. Putin countered by calling U.S. and European economic sanctions against Russia counterproductive.

Obama later conceded that pressure from recently imposed U.S. and European measures to squeeze the Russian economy “hasn’t resolved the problem yet.”

In an Obama-initiated phone call Friday, the U.S. president also raised concerns that Russia violated a key Cold War era nuclear weapons treaty, the White House said. In a letter this week from Obama to Putin and in an administration report released this week, the United States said Russia violated a 1987 treaty that bans all U.S. and Russian missiles of intermediate range, meaning those that can travel between about 300 miles and about 3,400 miles.

Putin in the call said the sanctions seriously damage bilateral cooperation and general global stability, according to a Kremlin report on the call.

It was the first conversation between the leaders since the U.S. and Europe slapped the new round of economic sanctions on Russia and since Obama’s letter claiming a breach in the missile treaty.

“I indicated to him, just as we will do what we say we do in terms of sanctions, we’ll also do what we say in terms of wanting to resolve this issue diplomatically if he takes a different position,” Obama told reporters later.

The Kremlin said both Obama and Putin underscored the urgency for bringing an end to fighting in eastern Ukraine and spoke positively about a meeting that took place the day before in Minsk, Belarus, among members of a diplomatic “contact group” pursuing an end to hostilities. That group includes representatives from Russia, Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.",unrelated

423,Report: Christian Bale Will Play Steve Jobs,"The Islamic State released a video of its jihadists beheading American journalist James Wright Foley in Syria. The video is almost five minutes long and includes threats against President Barack Obama and the United States.
In the video, which was temporarily available on YouTube but has since been removed, the terrorists remind the audience Obama authorized military action against IS and replayed Obama’s press conference when he announced the airstrikes. To them the declaration is a “slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims.”
Foley then appears on his knees in an orange jumpsuit. He relays a message that the US government is his true killer. He addresses his family as well. The message is choppy, which gives the appearance that he is reading off cards placed in front of the camera.
His executioner speaks with what appears to be a British accent, saying many Muslims worldwide accepted IS and a war against IS is, in essence, a war against Muslims. The UK has been one of the Islamic State's most active targets of recruitment.
After he beheads Foley, he presents to the camera another journalist, Steven Joel Soltoff, who worked for Time and The National Interest. Soltoff was reported missing in the middle of last year. The executioner said America’s next move will determine IS’s next move in what appears to be a threat against the second journalist.
Foley was an independent journalist in the Middle East. In 2011, he was one of four journalists kidnapped by Qaddafi’s forces in Libya, of which he said in an interview with the Boston Globe, “You don’t want to be defined as that guy who got captured in 2011... believe that front-line journalism is important.” He spoke at Northwestern University about his experience in Libya.

DNA tests have confirmed that the child held by Lebanese authorities is the daughter of the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Lebanon’s Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk told domestic television channel MTV that the child’s mother is believed to have married to al-Baghdadi six years ago for a period of three months, the BBC reports.

The Iraqi government had said she was not married to the Islamist leader.

The woman, identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, tried to enter Lebanon over a week ago accompanied by two sons and a daughter when she was detained by border guards.

Machnouk claims al-Dulaimi is pregnant but the child is not al-Baghdadi’s.

“We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is [al-Baghdadi’s] daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq,” Machnouk told MTV.

Machnouk said the children were staying at a care center while al-Dulaimi was being interrogated.

How? Extremists could crash the planes into the oil fields in any of the oil-rich countries on which the U.S. is dependent.
Beck was speaking with Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) about the jets when Bachmann remarked: “There’s really two concerns. One, the planes could be used in a similar way that they were used on 9/11 in the United States. They could be used as, essentially, flying bombs — into oil fields, buildings or strategic targets. Number two, [a] plane could be loaded with terrorists, could land as a commercial aircraft in an American city somewhere, or a European city. [They could] deplane, go about, carry out maybe a Mumbai-type disaster. So there’s multiple ways these planes could be used.”

“Oil fields,” Beck repeated. “The thing you said that feels the most true to me is the oil fields. … We’ll know what airplane — that’s one of those missing airplanes — but you could take off in Libya and be over the skies of Saudi Arabia in lightning speed, and just crash it.”

Bachmann said that with some routes, if a flight to Saudi Arabia deviates from its course, the Saudis only have 90 seconds to neutralize the threat before it could cause tremendous harm.

“It’s very little time that they have,” she said.

427,Senior Western Intelligence Official Confirms London Rapper Abdel Majed Abdel Bary Is A Suspect In The Foley Killing,"British intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6 have identified the man suspected of the horrific beheading of American journalist James Foley, according to UK media reports.

The hooded man with an English accent is believed to be 23-year-old Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, known to fellow Islamic State militants as Jihadi John.

The former rapper left his family home in an affluent west London suburb last year to fight in the civil war in Syria.

In early August he tweeted a photo of himself wearing military camouflage and a black hood, while holding a severed head in his left hand.

British SAS forces are hunting Foley's killers, using a range of high-tech equipment to track him down and potentially free other hostages.

The Mail on Sunday is reporting that a ""significant force"" of SAS personnel has been deployed to northern Iraq over the past two days, joining local units fighting IS. They have fanned out into four-man teams, accompanying Iraqi and Kurdish troops in an effort to find British jihadis.

The Sunday Times reports that Bary is the key focus of the man hunt. He is one of the British jihadists former hostages referred to as the Beatles because of their British accents. The two others were called ""George"" and ""Ringo"".

>Share this story on Facebook

The two other Britons suspected of involvement in the crime are Aine Davis, a former drug dealer who converted to Islam, and Razul Islam, who is believed to have joined the terrorist group that murdered Foley.

Bary is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trail on terrorism in Manhattan, due to his alleged involvement in the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.

Before leaving the family home to fight in Syria, Bary was an aspiring rapper known as L Jinny whose music was played on one of the UK's most popular radio stations, BBC Radio 1.

Recordings of his songs will prove vital to the investigating team, with experts using voice recognition technology to match his voice with that of the man who brutally decapitated Foley.

Bary made a number of music videos for his songs, with titles such as Flying High, Dreamer and Overdose.

428,Apple may launch 12-inch MacBook Air with Retina Display,"In a sprawling Facebook post and subsequent interview with Radar Online, a woman named Taylor Lianne Chandler has made a number of fascinating claims about herself and her alleged relationship with Michael Phelps.

""Many of you have wondered why I was so freaked out about my relationship with Michael Phelps being exposed,"" the 41-year-old D.C.-area woman begins her post. ""Here is the truth.""

I was born intersex and named David Roy Fitch at birth. By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one. In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery.

Citing an anonymous tipster (that could very well have been Chandler herself), The Hollywood Gossip previously named Chandler as Michael Phelps' companion the night of his latest DUI, a claim repeated in her recent Facebook post.

Yes, I was with Michael the night of the DUI, the story of the Uber and crying and me wanting to stay with him that night are true. A lot of the other things printed are lies. I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn't put him or our relationship in the best light. He is the first man I ever had intimacy with and felt comfortable and all woman.

Today, Chandler followed up her announcement by giving Radar Online additional details of her supposed first date with Phelps after meeting him on Tinder, which involved watching a Baltimore Ravens game at the athlete's home. ""One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,"" Chandler told the site. ""Later, we had sex again.""

Chandler says she only told Phelps about her past once the ""threat of the media exposing me forced me too.""

I am telling my story to take the power away from the media and tabloids that want to hurt Michael and I. I will probably lose him, which hurts like hell.

429,Bali spider burrows under Aussie’s chest,"Prepare to meet ... mite man.

Doctors removed a matchhead-sized insect, believed to be a spider, from under Dylan Thomas’s skin earlier this week and have sent the creature away for testing to determine what it is.

It had been there for three days and burrowed up to his chest, leaving a trail of red blisters.

The 21-year-old was on his first trip to Bali.

He told News Corp yesterday that doctors had pulled a tropical spider “a bit bigger than the size of a match head” from his skin.

There’s just one problem.

Spiders, according to Perth arachnid expert Dr Volker Framenau, don’t burrow in skin.

“They don’t have the tools, the armature, to do this sort of stuff,” Dr Framenau said.

“I find it highly unlikely, almost impossible, that it was a spider.’

More likely, Dr Framenau said, was some kind of burrowing mite.

“That’s a professional skin-digger,” he said.

“There’s a lot of nasty stuff out there.”

The results of the tests on the creature should come back next week.

Whatever the case, the quest for better pictures and videos of Bigfoot, Yeti, Almasti and their counterparts got a new entry this week from Adygeysk, Russia. That’s where a local mountain rescue team, after getting calls of Yeti sightings in the Adygeysk area, went out to investigate. They found what they were looking for and had the presence of mind and steadiness of hand to take a video of the Yeti walking away from them.

Adygeysk is a city and tourist destination in the Republic of Adygea in southern Eastern Europe at the heavily forested foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. The local remote rescue service, part of the Emergency Ministry, received calls of Yeti sightings, which prompted the TV station to investigate. Ludmila Hristoforova was one of the witnesses identified in the TV report and gave this description:
The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we’ve seen something big and shaggy.
Senior search team Andrei Kazaryan was one of the investigators and says he heard the foot crunches and found footprints.
They were 5 to 6 centimeters deep and couldn’t come from a human foot. We took a plaster cast of them and we estimate that it probably would have taken about 200 kilos to press the snow down that much.
The footprint cast and video were given to scientists and to a local museum, which has an exhibit on Yeti.

The Caucasus mountains are known for Yeti and particularly Almasti or wild man sightings, so this occurrence is not unusual. However, some video viewers say the Yeti walks too much like a human to be real. Others point out that this is a tourist area and any Bigfoot sighting is sure to increase the number of visitors (and possibly raise property values).

Retina MacBook Air release date rumours: When is the new MacBook Air coming out?
The latest 'word on the street' (not our words) sounds to us like a bit of a long shot, but here goes. It's been suggested by a number of websites that Apple will launch its next range of MacBooks during the Christmas holidays.

Aside from the obvious problem (which is that this would be an unbelievable nightmare for us poor souls in the media), this seems to be a case of a reasonable article by Boy Genius Report, written back in August, being rehashed and misinterpreted this month.

For a start, BGR wrote that the next MacBook Air would be ready in time for the Christmas holidays, not launched during them (releasing during the holidays would be a truly bizarre move, denying the products access to the lucrative pre-Christmas shopping period). That nuance seems to have been lost in translation. And beyond this, the article was as we said written in August, at which point a pre-Christmas launch still seemed possible. Now we're pretty much certain that the Retina MacBook Air will have to wait until 2015.

UPDATE, 7 Jan 2015: Sure enough, no MacBook Air appeared over Christmas. The very idea! The latest rumour suggests instead that a radically slimmed-down 12in MacBook Air will launch in mid-2015, perhaps making an appearance at WWDC 2015. See more details and images in the Design section, below.

We've been awaiting the launch of a new MacBook Air for some time. Back in summer 2014 Apple made a few tweaks to the MacBook Air line up, but this was mainly to reduce prices; the processor bump was very slight. Read our reviews of the current MacBook Air range here: 11in 2014 MacBook Air review and MacBook Air 2014, 13in, review.

What people are really waiting for is a new MacBook Air with Intel's (delayed) Broadwell processor, and a Retina display.

The new MacBook Air line up is said to include a completely new 12-inch model which may replace the 11-inch version, giving customers the option of a slighly bigger screen, or it may replace the 13-inch model, where customers could instead opt for the comparitively priced 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display.

So when will this new MacBook Air arrive? Reports in mid June suggested that Apple would begin production of this 12-inch MacBook Air in the third quarter. According to a DigiTimes report, Quanta Computer was set to begin production of the new 12-inch MacBook Air in July. This may have started, if the new Intel chips arrived in time...

They may have: Intel has issued a press release regarding the arrival of its new Core M chip that some believe could be used in the new MacBook Air. A number of manufacturers are already said to be using this new chip in their laptops and tablets, and some of these models will be available in October. According to Intel, Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Toshiba are all using the Core M.

If this new Intel chip is used by Apple, reports suggest that the new Retina MacBook Air will be available in time for Christmas.

In an August report on Digitimes, the Taiwan-based site claimed that its sources in the Taiwanese supply chain said that the production of components for the new MacBook had begun and that it may launch before the end of this year, or next year.

However, there are also reports that suggest the new Retina MacBook Air could be delayed until next year - it may not be using these Core M chips, relying instead on a different series of Intel Core i5 Broadwell processors (more on that below).

One report even suggests a mid-2015 launch date, claiming that the date has already been pushed back on multiple occasions.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours : Redesign, new colours, thinner design
On 6 January 2015, 9to5Mac posted a series of images that it says show the next MacBook Air's radical new design.

New 12in MacBook Air design mockups by 9to5mac

Bear in mind that these are artist's renders rather than photos of the real thing (although we're sure you'll agree that they're extremely well done - the artist is Michael Steeber). 9to5mac commissioned the images based on information it acquired from sources within Apple ""who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer"".

It isn't entirely clear how much of the design comes from the sources and how much from the artist's imagination, although many of the most major changes (to the keyboard layout, for instance) are obviously in the former category.

Sure enough, the new design is for a laptop with a new screen size: 12 inches. Yet the slimming process in these designs is so extreme that the new 12in MacBook Air actually has a smaller body than the existing 11in MacBook Air. The screen is a little bigger, but everything around the screen has been shrunk.

Here (according to the renders, at any rate) is how the new 12in MacBook Air (left) will compare to the current 11in MacBook Air (right):

New 12in MacBook Air design mockups by 9to5mac

This also partly illustrates the biggest bombshell in these leaks: the new design finds space for only one port on each side of the laptop. It has a USB port on the righthand edge (the new, smaller and reversible, Type-C USB) and a headphone socket, along with a couple of microphone holes, on the left. If this is right, the MacBook will have to be powered via the USB port - and sure enough, USB Type-C will be perfectly adequate for that purpose. It just means that you won't be able to use a USB hard drive, wired mouse (or wireless mouse dongle) or other USB accessory while the MacBook is plugged in.

Macworld contributor Kirk McElhearn is one of the sceptics who have pointed out the numerous inconveniences this would impose, and it's possible - likely, we would say - that the eventual layout will be less extreme. We think the MagSafe power connection is likely to survive. 

As we mentioned briefly, the keyboard is also designed differently. The power button now sits next to the Esc key at the top-left corner of the keyboard, and the keys have in general been shrunk down and squeezed together. The trackpad, on the other hand, has been expanded and now comes closer to the keys.

Of course, 9to5mac's images aren't the first apparent leak about the next MacBook Air's design.

Jack Marsh, a 16-year-old blogger who appears to have a source with plausible information about the new MacBook Air, seems to have become the the go-to blogger for all MacBook Air rumours. There have certainly been other young bloggers who have gained insight into unannounced Apple products, but as yet we can't be sure the claims are legitimate.

Marsh has a rumour about the MacBook Air to add to an earlier rumour that suggested the new model would come in gold, silver and space grey finishes (more on that below). Now he claims his source has told him that the new design is so thin Apple has had to switch to a new reversible USB Type C connector which is significantly smaller than USB 3 (it's 8.4x2.6mm).

Apparently the MagSafe port is also getting a redesign for the same reason: the laptop chassis is too thin to accomodate the current MagSafe charger. Indeed the MacBook Air may charge in an entirely new way, although Marsh's source wasn't clear on whether this had been finalised yet.

The MacBook Air is also said to feature thin bezels with a keyboard that stretches to the edge of the laptop. Marsh also claims his source told him: ""The display bezels are noticeably thinner - quite similar to the current MacBook Pro Retina lineup.""

Marsh's earlier report claimed that the new MacBook Air will come in iPhone-like space grey and gold finishes, as well as the usual aluminium.

MacRumors lent some credibility to this inisial report, claiming that they are aware that ""Apple has at least considered launching the 12in notebook with several different 'special edition' colour options"". And it wouldn't be the first time Apple has introduced a range of colour choices on their Mac laptops.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: 12-inch screen
Many of the new MacBook Air rumours suggest this model will feature a 12in screen.

Some sources point to evidence that Apple is working with 12in screens, but there have been claims that Quanta Computer will be building a rumoured 12-inch iPad later this year and it could be the iPad Pro that is being referred to here.

According to a DigiTimes report in June, sources claim Apple wishes to introduce a smaller MacBook Air to make clearer the distinction between the 11-inch MacBook Air and the iPad Air with its 9.7-inch screen.

Canalys analyst Daniel Matte also believes Apple is working on a new version of the MacBook Air - one with a 11.88in screen. Other rumours place the screen size at 12in (which probably matches Matte's expectations).

In his blog Matte seems to be suggesting that there may only be one MacBook Air - this new 12-inch model, with the 13-inch model being phased out in favour of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display.

KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested back in October 2013 that Apple will launch a 12-inch MacBook Air in 2014. Kuo suggested that this new MacBook Air would have an entirely new design.

The smaller 12in model could still accommodate a reasonably sized screen and keyboard if it had a smaller bezel.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Fanless design
The new MacBook Air is also said to be even thinner than the existing MacBook Air. This is based on the theory that it will use Intel's new Intel Core M processor, a chip that doesn't need fans. By using this processor it is claimed that Apple could make the laptop 9mm thin. The MacBook Air is currently 0.3-1.7cm thick so it could be almost 1cm thinner at its thickest point.

Apparently the fan assembly is the reason why the MacBook Air is thicker at one end than the other. Removing the fan assembly would enable Apple to make the laptop thinner than ever, according to reports.

Presumably there will be some sort of cooling system built in, but that may not be necessary. The new Intel processors are said to be efficient enough to make the removal of the fan feasible - indeed there are already laptops on the market that do not feature a fan.

Even the Core M may still require cooling in a 12in laptop, though. The new Broadwell processor should enable a fanless design for the smaller (up to 11.6in) laptop or mobile device, notes Motley Fool, based on what Intel said at its developer forum in 2013.

It has been suggested that the MacBook Air could also offer thermal scaling and thermal management.

Another advantage of a fanless design would be quiet operation. There would also be no moving parts (making it less likely to break), and it could also offer higher battery capacity because the remaining space could be used to house a bigger battery.

If Marsh's source (above) is correct the new MacBook Air may offer USB Type C support, which is smaller than USB 3 (it's 8.4x2.6mm). USB Type C is able to support 10Gbps data transfers, which is twice as fast as USB 3, but still slower than Thunderbolt 2 (although the same as the older Thunderbolt 1).

It will also support for up to 100 watts of power, which is apparently enough to power 4K displays, as Apple's Thunderbolt cable does currently. The only problem is that USB Type C isn't backwards-compatible.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Inductive charging
Marsh's source also claims that the MagSafe port may get a redesign and that the MacBook Air may charge in an entirely new way. Perhaps the new MacBook Air will use inductive charging like the Apple Watch does.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Trackpad changes
According to a report on Chinese site Weiphone earlier this year, the new MacBook Air will be thinner and lighter, a feat it will achieve by removing the fan and the clicking mechanism in the trackpad.

The new 12in model will drop the trackpad and introduce ""force and optical sensors"" and new touch gestures, according to this report from BEN Latest News.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Retina display
Will the next MacBook Air feature a Retina display? That's one of the strongest and most persistent rumours, and it's certainly possible.

Apple may opt to keep prices down (and battery life up) by keeping the screen non-Retina; but we don't think so. According to our own reviews of the MacBook Air, the MacBook Air is currently let down by its display, which has a lower resolution than the competition.

Canalys analyst Daniel Matte has written a blog claiming that Apple will add a Retina display to the MacBook Air this year. He expects that we will see a 11.88-inch model with a resolution of 2,732x1,536 pixels, the same 264ppi that the iPad Air offers.

He explains the significance of Apple using the same display technology for the MacBook Air and iPad Air, stating: ""It turns out that an ~11.88"" Retina MacBook Air with a 2732 x 1536 resolution happens to have the exact same pixel density as the 9.7"" 2048 x 1536 Retina iPads: ~264 PPI. It would make sense for Apple to take advantage of the same display technology it has been utilizing for the 9.7"" iPads by cutting their panels to this larger size.""

Rumours also claim that the new MacBook Air Retina display could have a resolution of 2,304 x 1,440 for a rumoured 12in display (discussed below). That's 226 pixels per inch, compared to 227 pixels per inch for the 13in MacBook Pro (which offers 2,560-by-1,600 resolution). This adds up to a 16:10 aspect ratio like that found on the 13in MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models, rather than the 16:9 aspect ratio currently offered by the 11in MacBook Air.

The current 11.6-inch MacBook Air offers a 1366 x 768 pixel display.

The rumours of a MacBook Air with Retina display have been long running. Back in February 2013, rumours suggested that Apple was planning to launch a revamped MacBook Air with a Retina display in the third-quarter of 2013. A separate report in March 2013 also claimed that Apple would introduce a Retina display to the MacBook Air in 2013. Since this didn't happen in 2013, it is perhaps likely for 2014. 

Apple does appear to be moving the whole of its range to Retina display. The company updated the Retina versions of its MacBook Pro in 2013, and also introduced a Retina iPad mini in October 2013.

Apple may use the IGZO display technology for the new display, offering improved power efficiency. The reason for the supposition is that Apple was recruiting for a engineers with experience in LED backlighting and LCD displays, in February, according to CultofMac. In an LCD display the bunches of pixels with wires running behind to connect them. The backlight has to shine though this mesh of wires to light up the pixels. In an IGZO display more light is able to shine though this mesh of wires, so the power requirements are lower, and battery life can be preserved. As a result we could see even longer battery life than the 12 hours currently on offer from the 13in MacBook Air.

Rumours about a Retina MacBook Air with a smaller display have been circulating for some time. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested back in October 2013 that Apple will launch a 12-inch MacBook Air in 2014. Kuo suggested that this new MacBook Air would have an entirely new design.

Then back in January 2014, Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang predicted that a 12in MacBook/iPad hybrid would launch in the autumn of 2014. It is possible that the rumoured Retina display MacBook Air could be this Mac.

Canalys analyst Daniel Matte also believes Apple will add a Retina display to the MacBook Air this year.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Processor
Intel has announced the new Intel Core M chip. Some expect that this processor may be used by Apple inside the new MacBook Air. As mentioned above, because this chip doesn't need fans, the new MacBook Air could be less than a centimeter thick at its thickest point. Since it uses the 14nm processor, the processor itself it is tiny.

The Core M processor should also enable the new MacBook to be more power-efficient with better battery life. Intel claims it's the most energy-efficient chip yet.

The Core M also offers excellent graphics processing power, according to Intel. Intel says it will offer seven times the graphics power of four-year-old machines, and double the graphical and three times the web performance of the current range of high-end tablets.

However, Intel has not confirmed that Apple will use the new processor. (In the press release regarding the new chip, Intel mentions Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Toshiba as potentially using the Core M. Some of these models will be available in October, according to Intel.)

The Core M is designed for small laptops, large tablets and 2-in-1 devices, and Intel is positioning the chips as being for use in laptops of 13.3in, tablets above 10in and dual devices. Apple would traditionally use the Core i5 chips in its MacBook, so it is possible that these processors will never appear in a MacBook Air which may instead use the new U Broadwell processor, which may not ship until 2015.

Redmond Pie reports that performance with the Core M hasn't been particularly impressive; it was featured in the Lenovo Yogo 3 Pro, which didn't exactly set the world alight: benchmark speed tests and overall reviews rated the device quite poorly. It's therefore been suggested that Apple may give the Core M a miss and go instead for an i5 or i7 chip.

(On the other hand, some analysts have argued that Lenovo's implementation of the Core M, rather than the innate qualities of the Core M itself, was to blame for the sub-standard performance, and that Apple's engineers would be able to coax solid performance from a Core M-equipped MacBook Air. We shall see.)

Whichever Broadwell processor Apple does use, it should make the Retina display MacBook Air possible. Broadwell is said to consume 30 percent less power than its predecessor Haswell, and that should be good news for battery life on the portable Macs, especially those with power hungry screens.

Other features of the Broadwell chip are that it is low power and offers integration with WiDi, 4G WWAN and WiGig networks.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: May not use Intel chips
This rumour has been floating around for some time. It is possible that Apple will ditch the Intel processor in its range of laptop in favour of its own home-made A-series chips, like those found in the iPad and iPhone.  

Some have even speculated that the new MacBook Air could mark some sort of crossover between the iPad and the MacBook, perhaps an iPad Pro.

However, rumours that Apple will move from Intel to ARM chips seem unlikely, based on this explaination from Cult of Mac.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: UK price
With the price of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with Retina display being so close we had expected that Apple would reduce the price of the entry-level MacBook even further. It's currently £749 for the 11in model, which is £100 less than in 2013. This compares to the MacBook Pro Retina starting price of £999. However, the fact that the top-of the range iPhone 6 Plus costs more than the entry level MacBook Air (£789) makes us think that the MacBook Air price is more likely to increase.

It may be that the 13-inch MacBook Air is discontinued, as that model is similar in price to the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina, but not equal in specs. This would leave the cheaper 12-inch MacBook Air models with, potentially, an entry-level price of £800.

When it first launched in October 2012, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display started at £1,449. This was reduced to £1,249 a few months later when the range received a processor upgrade. Now, with the April 2014 update to the MacBook Air, the entry-level price of the 13-inch model is a much more compelling £999 which makes the difference between the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display and the 13-inch MacBook Air £250 rather than £150.

In his predictions last year, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the price of this new 12-inch MacBook Air model could be lower than the current line up of Mac laptops.

Didn't Apple already introduce the 2014 MacBook Air?
Apple unveiled the latest update to the MacBook Air on 29 April 2014.  Quietly updating its MacBook Air line-up with improved Haswell processors from Intel. You can read our review of the 2014 11in MacBook Air and the review of the 13in MacBook Air here.

Aside from the small processor boost and a tiny battery life tweak, the main change for the new MacBook Air models was the price. Each model is now under £1,000, with prices starting at £749, £100 less than the previous models. This helps keep the MacBook Air an attractive option for customers, as the previous price was not much different to the price of the new MacBook Pro with Retina display.

The range update came as some surprise as the Retina display for the MacBook Air rumour was already in circulation. Prior to the MacBook Air update in April, there were suggestions that the new MacBook Air with Retina display could launch at WWDC, but this was obviously not the case.

Why is the Retina MacBook Air delayed?
If there is a delay, the key reason may be the availability of Intel processors, rather than the production of the new design.

Intel's newest generation of chips - the successor to the Haswell chips currently in the MacBook Air - called Broadwell has been plagued by delays. However, in a conference call about Intel's second-quarter results on 15 July, Intel's chief executive Brian Krzanich confirmed Intel’s hardware partners will have Broadwell systems on store shelves in the run up to Christmas. He said: ""We said we would have products on shelves for the holiday season and we continue to work with our partners and we’re on schedule to have product on shelf in the holiday.""

As we mention above, some of these new chips are now shipping, however, anyone awaiting the new Retina MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac and Mac mini should note that there are various Broadwell chips being developed by Intel, and the chips that Intel confirmed are shipping now are the M variety, destined for fanless two-in-ones. The new MacBook Air may use the U Broadwell processor, which may not ship until 2015.

We are sure that Apple is pretty frustrated with Intel.

Shipment of Skylake – the successor to Broadwell which will offer even more power than that chip - is also delayed.

New Retina MacBook Air release date: Will the MacBook Air be an iPad Pro?
There are also rumours that Apple could launch a 12in iPad, but this might not arrive until 2015, or the rumours could relate to the 12in MacBook.

There are also rumours that the new MacBook Air merge with the iPad to create the iPad Pro. You can read more about the iPad Pro rumours here.

We think that a MacBook Air that offered a dual boot system for iOS 7 and Mac OS X would be very interesting, however, Tim Cook last year ruled out any kind of convergence suggesting that a Toaster Refrigerator wouldn't work.

Will the old non-Retina MacBook Air remain?
If Apple launches a 12in MacBook Air, will it discontinue the existing models? It's possible that if Apple launches a 12in Retina MacBook Air model it will discontinue both, or either of the existing models. Equally, Apple could maintain one of the existing models as an entry-level model. It seems more likely that it would keep the 11in model on at an even lower price, rather than keep on the bigger 13in model.

One reason why Apple may keep a lower-priced MacBook Air on is the fact that Apple has just introduced a new entry-level iMac and already the MacBook Air looks superior to that, despite costing less. If Apple wants a low end option, it would appear unlekely that the Retina MacBook Air would be it.

Read our review of the new £899 iMac and see how it compares to the MacBook Air.

The new MacBook Air will be solar-powered
Ok, so this is a bit of an out-there rumour, but it really is possible that Apple will one day release a new MacBook Air with a solar powered display.

In January 2013, Apple was granted a patent that described a method for harnessing sunlight to illuminate a MacBook's display. This patent is actually the seventh solar-related patent Apple has gained in the past two years.

New Retina MacBook Air leaked images
At present, there are no new MacBook Air leaked images to share with you, but we will update this story as soon as one surfaces on the web.

We have seen a few concept images, however...

Perhaps inspired by the Mac Pro, or the Space Grey iPhone 5s, there are calls for a black version of the MacBook Air. TUAW has provided some renders of how such a MacBook Air could look.

432,"Nun gives birth, intends to keep baby","(ANSA) - Ancona, January 23 - A Bolivian nun gave birth in San Severino Marche after being taken to hospital where she complained of a bad stomach ache, Italian newspaper Corriere Adriatico said on Friday.
    The newspaper said the nun, whose age wasn't given, gave birth last Sunday and intends to keep the baby, whose sex wasn't given.
    The nun had been staying at a cloistered convent in the province of Macerata since June.
    The hospital hasn't confirmed the birth and the bishop of nearby town Camerino, Francesco Brugnaro, hasn't made any comment on the case. Another case of a nun giving birth took place in 2011 in Marche, when a 41-year-old Congolese nun gave birth to a baby girl in Pesaro.
    In that case, the nun had been raped abroad by a foreign priest and initially gave her daughter up for adoption.
    The case engendered strong protests from the adoptive family after it reached Italy's highest court of appeals in February 2014 after the nun changed her mind and was granted custody, reversing a lower court decision.",discuss
433,Pentagon: Somali terror group leader killed in U.S. airstrike,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Friday confirmed the death of the leader of the al-Shabab terror group, Ahmed Abdi Godane, who was the target of a U.S. airstrike Monday in Somalia.

The Pentagon’s press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, confirmed the death in a brief written statement. President Barack Obama, speaking at the conclusion of a NATO summit in Newport, Wales, said the successful U.S. strike was an example of his administration’s determination to hit back at terrorists.

Obama said the U.S. would use the same approach in degrading the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.

“We have been very systematic and methodical in going after these kind of organizations” that threaten U.S. personnel and the homeland, Obama said. “That deliberation allows us to do it right, but have no doubt: We will continue to do what is necessary to protect the American people.”

The White House declared a counterterrorism success.

“Godane’s removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al-Qaida affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals,” a White House statement said.

“Even as this is an important step forward in the fight against al-Shabab, the United States will continue to use the tools at our disposal – financial, diplomatic, intelligence and military – to address the threat that al-Shabab and other terrorist groups pose to the United States and the American people.” It added.

U.S. officials had said after the strike on Monday that U.S. special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions. But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday.

The State Department declared al-Shabab a terrorist organization in February 2008.

Kirby said on Tuesday, before the Pentagon was certain that Godane had died, that the U.S. strike was conducted south of Mogadishu and that it had destroyed the vehicle that was targeted. He noted that in September 2013, Godone had publicly claimed al-Shabab was responsible for the deadly Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya.

“Under the leadership of Godane, al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for many bombings, including suicide attacks in Mogadishu and in central and northern Somalia, typically targeting officials and perceived allies of the federal government of Somalia, as well as the former transitional federal government of Somali,” Kirby said Tuesday.",discuss
434,NEWS/ You'll Never Guess How a Homeless Man Spent $100—Watch the Touching Video!,"Crews removed a time capsule dating back to 1795 on Thursday from the granite cornerstone of the Massachusetts Statehouse, where historians believe it was originally placed by Revolutionary War luminaries Samuel Adams and Paul Revere among others.

The small time capsule is believed to contain items such as old coins, documents, newspapers and a metal plate that was owned by Revere.

Secretary of State William Galvin speculated that some of the items could have deteriorated over time.

Official plan to X-ray the capsule on Sunday at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts to get some idea of the contents and possibly details on their condition, then open it next week.

Originally made of cowhide, the time capsule was believed to have been embedded in the cornerstone when construction on the state Capitol began in 1795. Adams was governor of Massachusetts at the time.

The time capsule was removed in the mid-19th century and its contents transferred to a copper box, Galvin said. Its removal Thursday was due to an ongoing water filtration project at the building. Galvin said the plan is to return it to the site sometime next year.

Pamela Hatchfield, a conservator at the museum, was exhausted Thursday after spending hours chiseling and drilling on the massive cornerstone, taking care not to damage the time capsule or coins that were thrown in the mortar that held it in place.

She held up the capsule for viewing by state officials, reporters and contractors involved in the renovation of the Statehouse.

'It's heavy,' Hatchfield said. 'I feel happy and relieved and excited and really interested to see what's in this box.'

Hatchfield said state officials did not know that the time capsule was embedded in the cornerstone until 60 years after some of the nation's leading founding political figures put it there.

'It was first put in there in 1795 by Paul Revere and Sam Adams and was unearthed accidentally when in 1855 there were some amendments to the building,' Hatchfield said. 'They put the contents back into a new box and placed it in a depression in the stone, which is on the underside.'

Galvin said there were notes from 1855 indicating that officials washed some of the contents in the capsule with acid before putting them in the new copper box.

It also was a humid day when the items were restored and, Galvin said, the corner of the Statehouse where the capsule was fixed has had a water leakage problem for 30 years.

The Massachusetts Statehouse is one of the oldest, active statehouses in the country

'We have to see what held up since that time,' he said. 'That's the biggest question we have right now — are the contents in good condition or not?'

Galvin said the Massachusetts Statehouse is one of the oldest, active statehouses in the country.

'Obviously, when we talk about the original box being presided over by then-Gov. Sam Adams, Paul Revere, it's pretty significant,' he said. 'I'm very fond of saying ... that the history of Massachusetts is the history of America, and it's very true and this is another evidence of that.'

The excavation came just months after another time capsule was uncovered from the Old State House, which served as the state's first seat of government. That long-forgotten time capsule, dating to 1901, turned up in a lion statue atop the building and, when opened, was found to contain a potpourri of well-preserved items including newspaper clippings, a book on foreign policy and a letter from journalists of the period.",unrelated
435,This Selfless Homeless Man Receives $100 & Doesn't Spend A Dime On Himself!,"Militants from Islamic State (Isis) claimed to have killed an American journalist long held captive in Syria in retaliation for ongoing US airstrikes against its forces in Iraq.

A propaganda video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man dressed in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Wright Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012.

The masked executioner spoke in English, with what sounded like a British accent, and said that the slaying came in response to the airstrikes ordered by President Barack Obama against Isis 12 days ago.

Isis, whose chief spokesman came under State Department sanctions on Monday, warned of further revenge – including on another man purported to be a captured US journalist, Steven Sotloff – and in the video, the victim was made to read a statement blaming the US for his own murder.

Foley has been missing in Syria since November 2012, where he went to report on the bloody struggle to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. He was initially thought to have been captured by forces loyal to the Assad regime.

A Facebook message from a support group, Free James Foley, urged patience “until we all have more information,” and asked that readers “keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

YouTube took down the gruesome video, but not before it sparked a debate on social media about the ethics of sharing it, adding a metatextual debate to a depiction of a man’s violent death.

Foley, 40, a former Stars and Stripes reporter, was captured in November 2012 near the Syrian town of Taftanaz. It was not his first detention while reporting: in 2011, he was taken while reporting on the uprising against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi’s forces ultimately released him after six weeks in captivity.

A friend of Foley’s and his fellow captive in Libya, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote in a 2013 essay that captivity was “the state most violently opposite his nature.” Gillis described Foley as gentle, friendly, courageous and impatient with “anything that slows his forward momentum.”

In a January 2013 interview with local television news near her Rochester, New Hampshire home, Foley’s mother Diane said her son was “passionate about covering the story in Syria, passionate about the people there.”

Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said US intelligence was working to determine the authenticity of the video.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said in a statement.

Messages left with the Foley family were not returned.

A day after Obama declared that Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US warplanes had broken Isis’ hold on the critical Mosul Dam, US Central Command announced two strikes near it on Monday, to “further expand control of the area.” One strike was said to have destroyed an Isis checkpoint while the other was “not successful.”

Obama has offered no timeframe for the length of his campaign against Isis. The US military has bombed over 90 targets attributed to Isis, including vehicle convoys, mobile artillery and fixed positions, since 8 August. Most of the strikes have come in the past few days, near the dam. The other strikes have occurred either to blunt an Isis advance on the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil or to lift an Isis siege on Mount Sinjar, where it chased thousands of Iraqi Yazidis whom it threatened to kill unless they converted to Islam. The US considers the siege broken.",unrelated

Here’s the disclaimer for the site: “Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.”

It had more than 80,000 shares as of Wednesday.

A number of people apparently believed the fake article.

“And Brad Pitt is a bad choice to play John Teller anyway , I’d Choose Sam Elliot,” one person wrote in the comments section.

Added another: “Hope this is fake. Not sure I like Brad Pitt as John Teller. I don’t want to look at the screen and feel it’s another Hollywood movie. Should get lost in the story just like on TV and may not happen when seeing Brad Pitt. Should get a little known actor for the role to create the character rather than buy one.”

Here’s what the original article said:

Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture.

Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. “People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film” Sutter said.

Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt.",unrelated
437,"No, a bird didn't poop on Vladimir Putin","DNA tests have confirmed that a daughter and an ex-wife of the head of Isis, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, are indeed being held by Lebanese authorities.

There have been conflicting reports about the identity of the woman, with an Iraqi official denying on Wednesday she was al-Baghdadi's ex wife.

But a Lebanese interior minister confirmed today that the woman and child who were detained about 10 days ago in northern Lebanon travelling with a fake ID are in fact the ex wife and daughter of the terrorist leader.

Islamic State (IS) group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addresses worshippers at a mosque in Mosul, after he established a self-declared caliphate across Iraq and Syria on July 5, 2014

The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi, was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday.

He said DNA tests showed that the girl was Baghdadi's child.

'Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,' he said.

'Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child,' Mashnuq added.

'We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is his (Baghdadi's) daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq,' the minister said.

The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi (pictured), was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday

He gave no details on Dulaimi's nationality, but a security source said she was believed to be Iraqi.

Mashnuq offered no further information about her current husband, although he said investigations showed the woman had ties to extremists in Lebanon.

Dulaimi's children were at a children's care centre while she was being interrogated, he said.

Mashnuq also confirmed the arrest of the wife of Anas Sharkas, a leader in Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front.

Dulaimi was among a group of female prisoners released from Syrian jails in March, in exchange for 13 nuns from the ancient town of Maalula held by Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front.

The Islamic State (IS) group has yet to comment publicly on Dulaimi's detention, but Al-Nusra, despite a feud with Baghdadi's group, issued a statement of condemnation.

It described her as 'sister Saja al-Dulaimi' and said the arrest of women and children was evidence of the 'weakness' of the Lebanese state.

Sources said the detention of Dulaimi and Sharkas's wife could help the Lebanese as they struggle to negotiate the release of 27 members of the security forces held by jihadists from IS and Al-Nusra.

The soldiers and police were abducted when militants from the two groups briefly overran the Lebanese border town of Arsal in August.

438,Microsoft turns to robotic security guards to watch for trouble,"Militants with the Islamic State jihadi group have released a video that appears to show the beheading of a British hostage, David Haines, an aid worker who was captured just days after he arrived in Syria last year.

British government officials were seeking to authenticate the video which purported to show the final moments of Haines, who was 44.

In the video, entitled A Message to the Allies of America, a masked man is shown carrying out the beheading of Haines, whose life had earlier been threatened in a film showing the murder of American journalist Steven Sotloff. The video, which runs to two minutes and 28 seconds, ends with a warning that a second British hostage would be the next to die. He has been named in international media and on social media as Alan Henning, a British aid worker.

Haines is the third western hostage and the first Briton to be killed in this fashion by Isis – the first, US journalist James Foley, was murdered in a video released on 19 August.

The British prime minister, David Cameron, issued a statement denouncing the killing. “This is a despicable and appalling murder of an innocent aid worker. It is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal.

“We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.”

Cameron will gather senior representatives of the military and security services and the Foreign Office and Home Office in Whitehall to discuss the situation.

The US president, Barack Obama, also condemned the killing. “The United States strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group Isil,” he said, using his administration’s preferred acronym for Isis. “Our hearts go out to the family of Mr Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom.

“The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve. We will work with the UK and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world.”

The recording features a voiceover delivered by an Isis militant, whose voice and accent closely resembles that of the killer in both the Sotloff and Foley videos. The killer directly addresses Cameron, saying that Haines “has to pay the price for your promise” to arm Kurdish peshmerga fighters against Isis.

Speaking to the camera, the hostage, composed but clearly under duress, and wearing an orange jumpsuit, reads out a statement in which he says that Cameron is “entirely responsible for my execution” for entering into a coalition with the US.

Haines, who was in the Royal Air Force for 12 years before moving into aid work, addresses Cameron, saying: “You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State, just as your predecessor, Tony Blair, did, following a trend amongst our British prime ministers who can’t find the courage to say no to the Americans.

“Unfortunately, it is we, the British public, that will in the end pay the price for our parliament’s selfish decisions.”

The killer, swathed in black, then makes a statement in which he makes a direct reference to the British government’s aid to Kurdish fighters.

He says: “This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State. Ironically, he has spent a decade of his life serving under the same Royal Air Force that is responsible for delivering those arms.

“Your evil alliance with America which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha dam will only accelerate your destruction. And playing the role of the obedient lapdog, Cameron, will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war.”

At the end of the latest video, another hostage, Henning, is paraded.

The US carried out at least nine air strikes last week on Isis militants threatening the Haditha dam. The bombing was cited by Haines’s killer in the video.

A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office in London said: “We are aware of the video and are working urgently to verify the contents.”

Isis had threatened to kill Haines, a father of two, in a video that emerged 11 days ago in which Sotloff was murdered. Less than 24 hours before the latest video emerged, the Haines family had made a plea to the jihadis to respond to their efforts to make contact.

The family statement, which was released by the Foreign Office and addressed the militants directly, said: “We are the family of David Haines. We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.”

Haines was born in East Yorkshire but raised in Perthshire, and before his capture was living in Croatia with his second wife Dragana.

He had a 17-year-old daughter with his first wife Louise, and a four-year-old daughter with Dragana, who has described him as a “fantastic man and father”. He was kidnapped while working for the aid organisation Acted, having previously worked in Libya and South Sudan.

A meeting of the British government’s emergency committee, Cobra, is expected to be called imminently and the prime minister’s attentions will be diverted from the referendum on Scottish independence, due to take place on Thursday.

Haines had worked for aid agencies in some of the world’s worst trouble spots, including Libya and South Sudan.

He was in Libya during its civil war in 2011, working as head of mission for Handicap International, which helps disabled people in poverty and conflict zones around the world.",unrelated

Chandler said she met Phelps, 29, on Tinder in August. He eventually invited her over to his place in Baltimore to watch a Ravens game in September and that’s when things went to another level.
“One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,” she told Radar. “Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.”

Chandler said she did eventually come clean, or at least try to, by sending Phelps an email after he entered rehab in October following his arrest for drunk driving. He reportedly has yet to respond.
As for their future together, Chandler basically said she’s hopeful but not counting on anything.

440,Iraqi media: ISIS militants have contracted Ebola,"The Islamic State (Isis) operating in Iraq does not have Ebola, the World Health Organization has confirmed.

Last week a number of reports emerged suggesting members of the terrorist organisation had contracted the disease.

The Daily Mail reported that three media outlets had said a number of militants had shown signs of the deadly virus in the city of Mosul.

Speaking to Mashable, a WHO spokesperson said they were investigating the reports. ""We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,"" Christy Feig, WHO's director of communications, told the website.

The organisation has now confirmed there are no suspected cases of Ebola in Iraq as of 5 January.

""On 31 December, 2014, Al-Sabah newspaper, Shafaq news agency and Rudaw online newspaper reported a rumour of EVD cases in Mosul, Ninewa governorate,"" WHO said in a statement. ""The news was also relayed through other media agencies in and outside of Iraq.

""Following this rumour, the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization investigated the allegations through existing surveillance networks, as well as through contacts with health authorities and medical sources in Ibn Sina Hospital in Mosul.

""All sources contacted have negated the existence of any suspected cases of Ebola. The Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization further confirmed that the laboratory facilities in Mosul do not have the necessary capabilities to diagnose and confirm the Ebola Virus.""

It said both the Ministry of Health and WHO has scaled up surveillance efforts to ensure early detection of any suspected Ebola cases, and that all precautionary measures are being taken to prevent the disease from entering Iraq.

""The surveillance efforts have been scaled up at all health facilities to ensure that any imported or suspected cases are promptly detected.

""A contingency and response plan is currently under development.""

Sources told the Wall Street Journal that Apple has been studying platinum casings, but that even if the company intends to build them, they are not expected to be announced during today's press event in San Francisco. Platinum watches can often sell for triple the price of gold ones.

The gold in the Edition Apple Watches is already anticipated to make them some of the most expensive products Apple has ever sold. Rumors have put prices anywhere between $5,000 and $20,000; for that reason, Apple is also allegedly installing special safes in its stores. The cheapest Watch will be $349, and midrange models could start around $500 or $600.

Apple may not be using standard 18-karat gold. Company exectutives have repeatedly claimed that their material is ""twice as hard"" as regular gold — which is fairly malleable — but haven't explained how this possible. Leancrew points to an Apple patent application describing an infusion of low-density ceramic particles.

By weight, 18-karat gold is actually just 75 percent gold, with the remaining quarter normally being silver, copper, or a combination of metals. The Apple alloy could use less than a third of the gold traditionally required while still meeting 18-karat standards.

The Hollywood Reporter stated on Nov. 8, 2014, that Culkin has been the victim of yet another celebrity death hoax. No matter how many times the Internet may claim him to be dead, he just keeps on living and quietly enjoying life.

An article from a fake MSNBC website actually claims that the 34-year-old child star was found dead in his Manhattan apartment. It states that a wellness check was requested by a family member and police went over to check on him and he was found dead. There is even a fake quote from the police.

Mufid al-Hasaynah, minister of Housing and Public Works in the Palestinian unity government, told Xinhua that Israel deliberately increases the suffering of the Gazans.

""Dozens of houses were filled with water of the Israeli dams, which were largely opened this morning towards the Gaza Strip. These actions double the people's suffering who live under a tight Israeli siege,"" said the minister.

Early on Sunday, rescue teams and firefighters rushed to the central area of the Gaza Strip to rescue dozens of Palestinians who were stuck in their houses after Israel opened the dams.

Witnesses said that bulldozers were bringing sands to reduce the amounts of water that covered the houses in the area and that several main roads and streets were closed due to the floods.

The Gaza-based Ministry of Interior said in an emailed press statement that the civil defense teams rescued 18 families after their homes were fully covered with water that came from the Israeli side.

447,Boko Haram 'ceasefire' doubts after attacks reported in Nigeria,"Nigeria has agreed a truce with militant Islamist group Boko Haram, who look set to the release schoolgirls it abducted earlier this year

The Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped earlier this year by Islamist militant group Boko Haram look set to be released following a ceasefire agreement with the Nigerian military.

This truce, for which direct negotiations had been held in neighbouring Chad, marks the end of a five-year conflict between the Nigerian government and the Islamist insurgents.

“I wish to inform this audience that a ceasefire agreement has been concluded,” chief of defence staff Alex Badeh announced at the end of a three day security meeting between Nigeria and Cameroon.

It appears as though the 219 school girls that are being held captive by Boko Haram will be released, although a Defence Ministry spokesman said that part of the negotiations still needs to be finalised.

He was “assured that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well”.

Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told the BBC: ""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them. I am cautiously optimistic.""

He said arrangements for their release would be finalised at a meeting next week in Chad.

On April 15, Boko Haram – which means ‘education is sinful' – raided a school in the remote north-eastern town of Chibok, kidnapping 276 school girls and women. Dozens escaped in the days after the abduction.

This act brought the group international notoriety, with world leaders condemning the kidnapping and internet activists launching the global social media campaign #BringBackOurGirls.

Boko Haram had demanded the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls, but Nigeria president Goodluck Jonathan would not swap prisoners.

President Jonathan has come under fire in his country for failing to handle the threat of Boko Haram, which has reportedly killed 13,000 civilians in the years since 2009.

After insurgent success, Boko Haram began seizing and holding territory in the northeast of Nigeria, declaring a caliphate similar to that of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

In recent weeks, however, the Nigerian military has taken back towns from the extremists and is thought to have killed hundreds of Boko Haram militants.

Mike Omeri, the Nigerian government’s spokesman on the kidnappings, said: ""Already, the terrorists have announced a cease-fire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a cease-fire.”

""Commitment among parts of Boko Haram and the military does appear to be genuine. It is worth taking seriously,"" a security source told Reuters.

That source said, however, that it is unlikely that the ceasefire extends to all factions of the Boko Haram group.

""There are some talks but it depends on the buy-in of the whole group. I would be surprised if Shekau had suddenly changed his mind and is ready for a ceasefire,"" the source said.

The government was negotiating with Danladi Ahmadu, a man calling himself the secretary-general of Boko Haram, the presidency source said. It was not clear if Ahmadu is part of the same faction as Shekau.

Boko Haram has not made a public statement.

The Boko Haram crisis in Nigeria had for months been neglected by the western media following the emergence of Isis in the Middle East and more recently the Ebola outbreak in west Africa.

But, on Monday, major British politicians signed a letter that called for action against Boko Haram, and for the rescue of their captives.

Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Lord Ashdown classed Boko Haram alongside Isis as a part of a “growing, well-organised international terror network that poses a direct threat to UK national security.”

448,Insurgents killed in Nigeria despite alleged truce with Boko Haram,"Claim: Eleven passenger planes are missing from an airport in Libya.

PROBABLY FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, September 2014]

Seeking truth in stir of 11 missing / stolen commercial airliners from the Libyan airport during the fall of Tripoli.

Origins: In early August 2014, some North African bloggers began to spread stories that several commercial airliners were missing from the Tripoli International Airport during or shortly after the facility was taken over by Zintan militia forces earlier in the summer. Later that month translations of the blog posts began to be picked up by news outlets in Western Europe and passed on as fact rather than gossip; by early September those tales of translations of blogs had spread to the United States under the guise of real news.

The use of airplanes as terrorist weapons in 2001 makes it all too easy for us to anticipate their being used that way again. And despite denials from all sides — the airlines who are not missing any planes, the Libyan transport ministry, and the anti-government forces in control of the airport — the tales have found a ready audience among a populace already on edge in anticipation of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

However, there have been no statements from the State Department, the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, or any other authority warning of stolen airliners. The national threat level has not been raised. Algerian and Moroccan military and air defense, already on high alert due to the unrest just across their borders with Libya, would undoubtedly have noticed multiple flights of unidentified passenger aircraft.

449,ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John' identified as Mohammed Emwazi,"LONDON — The man in the black balaclava who has seemed to have beheaded several foreign hostages in Islamic State videos has been identified by British security services as Mohammed Emwazi, a British national from London.

Known in the news media as “Jihadi John,” he is said to have been born in Kuwait and traveled to Syria in 2012. His name was first published on Thursday on the website of The Washington Post.

The story was confirmed by a senior British security official, who said that the British government had identified Mr. Emwazi some time ago but had not disclosed his name for operational reasons.

Mr. Emwazi, 27, grew up in Queen’s Park, West London, and graduated from the University of Westminster with a degree in computer programming.

He first appeared in Islamic State videos in August, when he appeared to behead the American journalist James Foley and deliver threats against the West. The actual execution was not included in the video.

450,Saddam Hussein’s pilots training Islamic State group,"With Apple's media event just a week away and the company expected to offer final details there on the Apple Watch ahead of its April debut, The New York Times has a new report out sharing a few new tidbits on the device.

Among the interesting details is the existence of an unannounced ""Power Reserve"" mode for the watch that will display only the time and cut off all other functions as the battery begins to run critically low, preserving the most basic functionality of the watch. The report also notes that while the Apple Watch has been widely tested by Apple employees, the company did work to conceal many of those prototypes by disguising them to resemble Samsung smartwatches.

Sources have also provided more context to a Wall Street Journal article from last month that discussed how many of the originally planned health features for Apple Watch were dropped due to consistency issues. According to The New York Times' sources, the decision to drop many of those features came more than 18 months ago, refuting off-target reports in recent weeks claiming the cuts have come at the last minute.Nearly two years ago, the company experimented with advanced health monitoring sensors that tracked blood pressure and stress, among other variables. Many of those experiments were abandoned more than 18 months ago after the sensors proved unreliable and cumbersome, these people said.

Apple long ago decided that for the first version of the product, it would include a heart rate sensor and a sensor for tracking movement, to market the device as a fitness-tracking companion to the iPhone. Previous reports have indicated Apple is still working on those technologies, and they could appear in future versions of the Apple Watch.

Today's report reveals some additional insight into the development process, noting that the Apple Watch is coming a bit later than originally hoped due to technical challenges that were likely exacerbated by the loss of several engineers working on the project. Google's Nest Labs, headed by iPod pioneer Tony Fadell, was responsible for poaching several of the key Apple Watch employees.

Apple's media event will take place at 10:00 AM Pacific Time on Monday, March 9 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. The company will offer a live video stream of the event, and MacRumors will provide full coverage of the event.

453,Give a homeless man $100 and see what he does with it [Video],"(CNN) -- Boko Haram laughed off Nigeria's announcement of a ceasefire agreement, saying there is no such deal and schoolgirls abducted in spring have been converted to Islam and married off.

Nigerian officials announced two weeks ago that they had struck a deal with the Islamist terror group.

The deal, the government said, included the release of more than 200 girls whose kidnapping in April at a boarding school in the nation's north stunned the world.

In a video released Saturday, the Islamist group's notorious leader fired off a series of denials.

""Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?"" Abubakar Shekau said. ""They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.""

Shekau slammed reports of their planned release.

""We married them off. They are in their marital homes,"" he said, chuckling.

The group's leader also denied knowing the negotiator with whom the government claimed it worked out a deal, saying he does not represent Boko Haram.

""We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,"" he said of the negotiator.

It wasn't clear when the video was made.

Mike Omeri, coordinator of Nigeria's National Information Centre, told CNN on Saturday that all these claims contradict those made in conversations in which the Nigerian government has been involved.

Omeri said Nigeria's government will do everything possible to verify the claims made in the video.

Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to the aide.

The ceasefire deal announced October 17 followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.

After the deal was announced, the aide said final negotiations on the girls' release would be completed at a meeting a week later in Chad.

That day passed without any signs of the girls.

Boko Haram a growing challenge

In the video, Shekau talked not of peace but of more violence -- promising more ""war, striking and killing with gun.""

This strategy appears to be playing out in parts of Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire. More people have been abducted and scores killed in recent weeks, including one attack a day after the ceasefire that left eight dead.

Days later, members of the Islamist terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria, residents said Thursday.

Heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted, residents said.

For its part, the Nigerian government isn't backing down.

Rather, it is stepping up its military campaign against militants and criminals in some parts of the West African nation, Nigeria's defense ministry said on Saturday.

The military claimed its airstrikes and ground operations have repelled attacks against civilians in Adamawa and Borno, two of the states in northeastern Nigeria that have been strongholds and frequent targets for Boko Haram.

Officials are ""studying"" the latest video, even as the military continues to recognize the talks aimed at assuring the release of the kidnapped schoolgirls, the ministry said.

Boko Haram, whose name translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the Hausa language, is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Like ISIS, it has ambitions for a caliphate, or religious state.

The group's attacks have intensified in recent years in an apparent show of defiance for the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the government.

As part of its insurgency, it has bombed schools, churches and mosques, kidnapped women and children and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

454,Nigeria Claims Boko Haram Will Release the Kidnapped Schoolgirls,"Nigeria’s government and Boko Haram have agreed a ceasefire that brings closer the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in the north of the country more than six months ago.

Secret meetings held between the authorities in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, and representatives of the al-Qaeda-linked militia have led to an temporary agreement to lay down arms.

Part of the deal includes “the need to rescue all the captives of the terrorists, including the students of Government Girls’ Secondary School, Chibok”, said Mike Omeri, anti-terrorism spokesman of the president’s national information centre.

There would also be an immediate ceasefire, with Boko Haram apparently saying it would suspend its bombing and kidnap campaign, and the Nigerian army agreeing not to target suspected militant camps.

“From the discussions, [Boko Haram’s representatives] indicated their desire for, and willingness to discuss and resolve all associated issues,” Mr Omeri said. “They also assured that the school girls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well.”

The announcement came days after protesters marched in Abuja to mark the six-month anniversary of the girl’s abduction. Close to 300 teenage girls were kidnapped by armed gunmen as they were driven back to their school in coaches after an excursion.

Some managed to escape, but an estimated 219 are still being held captive, reportedly in Nigeria’s neighbour, Cameroon, whose military was involved in the ceasefire talks.

There was immediate scepticism, however. One Western diplomat in Lagos, Nigeria’s coastal commercial capital, pointed out that Goodluck Jonathan, the president, is in the middle of campaigning for the presidential elections due next year.

“He’s having a tough run with Boko Haram, and he needs a boost,” the diplomat said. “It’s the main thing that people are concerned about, security. If he can score a ceasefire, great. If he can bring the girls back, even better.

“But we’ve not yet heard from Boko Haram. Until then, we’re taking this with a little salt.”

Aid groups working to secure the release of the schoolgirls welcomed the news, but also remained cautious.

“This ceasefire is incredibly promising, but we aren’t there yet,” said Hussaini Abdu, country director for ActionAid Nigeria. “Until every girl is released negotiations must continue.

“We are excited about the possibility of restoring peace in the country, but these girls must remain a priority and we therefore urge the government to ensure that the safety of all of them is guaranteed as part of any truce.”

Britain is among several nations that has offered assistance to the Nigerian government and its military to help find the missing schoolgirls.

Privately, Western security sector sources in the country report exasperation among those coming to help over the slow pace of the Nigerians’ reactions to the kidnap crisis.

The girls are understood to have been separated into several groups, making an armed rescue far more complicated and dangerous, leaving talks as the only likely route to their release.

Boko Haram has in the past insisted that it would only release the teenagers if Nigeria freed several of the group’s senior commanders, who have been captured and are in jail. There were no immediate details of what Boko Haram will get out of the ceasefire deal.

The group has been blamed for hundreds of killings in bomb or gun attacks, and it is increasingly choosing targets over an ever wider area of northern Nigeria.

It began as a local militia targeting people who broke strict Islamic regulations such as drinking alcohol. But it recently linked with al-Qaeda’s franchise in West Africa, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and appears to have taken on far more ambitious aims, including ridding northern Nigeria of Christians.

Boko Haram’s leader, Abubakar Shekau, frequently justifies attacks on Christians as revenge for killings of Muslims in Nigeria’s volatile “Middle Belt”, where the largely Christian south and mostly Muslim north meet.

The Telegraph revealed last month that the International Committee of the Red Cross had become involved in a secret prisoner swap deal that would ensure the schoolgirls' return.

Officials from the Geneva-based organisation sat in on talks between the Nigerian government and a senior Boko Haram leader that was being held in one of the country's maximum security prisons.

The Red Cross officials also visited a number of other jails, identifying a list of 16 senior commanders that Boko Haram wants freed in exchange for the 219 hostages kidnapped from the north-east town of Chibok.

455,Turkish Leader Says U.S. Airdrop Aided ISIS Militants,"Multiple users of anonymous web browser Tor have reported that Comcast has threatened to cut off their internet service unless they stop using the legal software.

According to a report on Deepdotweb, Comcast customer representatives have branded Tor ""illegal"" and told customers that using it is against the company's policies.

Tor is a type of web browser that, in theory, makes all your internet activity private. The software routes traffic through a series of other connected internet users, making it difficult for governments and private companies to monitor your internet usage. Up to 1.2 million people use the browser, which became especially popular after Edward Snowden leaked information showing that the NSA was eavesdropping on ordinary citizens. Prior to that, Tor had been popular among people transacting business on Silk Road, the online market for drugs and hitmen.

The problem is that downloading or using Tor itself isn't illegal. Plenty of people might have legitimate reasons to want to surf the web in private, without letting others know what they were looking at. But Tor has been pretty popular with criminals.

Comcast has reportedly begun telling users that it is an ""illegal service."" One Comcast representative, identified only as Kelly, warned a customer over his use of Tor software, DeepDotWeb reports:

Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.

Comcast customers, speaking to Deepdotweb, claimed that Comcast repeatedly asked them which sites they were accessing using Tor.

In a statement to Deepdotweb, Comcast defended its actions, seemingly asserting that it needs to be able to monitor internet traffic in case they receive a court order:

We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customer’s account with a valid court order. And if we’re asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.

456,CNN Posts Alleged Audio of Michael Brown Shooting,"Video messaging app Glide on Thursday said it has verified the authenticity and timestamp of a recording that a Ferguson, Missouri resident captured as a police officer shot 18-year-old Michael Brown to death on a residential street.

While the anonymous Glide user was chatting with a friend, the sounds of what appear to be gunshots can be heard in the background (CNN video below). The user turned over the video to the FBI as evidence. Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg told CNN he detected six shots, followed by four more after a brief pause. An autopsy report commissioned by Brown's family said the unarmed man was shot at least six times. A Glide representative told the Washington Post the video is ""absolutely"" authentic.

""While tragedy is never good news, and our hearts go out to the family of Michael Brown, this incident underscores how technology is changing the landscape of not only journalism, but also criminology,"" Glide said in a blog post. ""Because Glide is the only messaging application using streaming video technology, each message is simultaneously recorded and transmitted, so the exact time can be verified to the second. In this case, the video in question was created at 12:02:14 PM CDT on Saturday, August 9th.""",discuss
457,Hospital Officials: Kansas City Patient Not Being Treated For Ebola,"A female worker reportedly gives out fake ratings to apps by physically going handset to handset. (Internet photo)

A photo recently uploaded online in China showing someone reportedly working on an array of mobile phones has gone viral overnight, as it gives a glimpse into China's app-ranking manipulation factory, reports Tencent Technology.

In the photo posted on to China's Weibo microblog, a woman with about a hundred iPhones placed before her appears to be giving out fake ratings to apps by going phone by phone.

About a hundred fake ratings, which have the potential to affect the top lists of Apple's App Store, can be created within an hour or two.

Apple has had adopted a number of measures to crackdown on fake downloads and cheating the rankings, including lowering the price of apps to only 1 yuan (US$0.16) which the company hopes could draw more real users to rate.

Yet given the fact that people in China are physically simulating real users, as seen in the leaked photo, it would be tough to crack down on the industry.

Numbers are important, as a majority of users refer to ratings when it comes to downloading apps. Those with better ratings have a much higher chance of being downloaded.",unrelated

The Cambodia eaterie
Leader Kim Jong-Un has already opened a diner in Amsterdam, with the 'Pyongyang' chain of restaurants also having branches in China and parts of Asia.

It has been reported that the dictator is believed to be interested in opening another in the UK, with claims by observers of North Korea that Kim is especially keen on an eaterie in Scotland.

His fondness of whisky and the profile of Scotland's referendum have been cited as key reasons for the potential serving of North Korean delicacies such as dog meat soup and pine-nut gruel in Scotland.

Proceeds from the 'Pyongyang' chain are funnelled back into North Korean government funds.

Michael Madden, editor of North Korea Leadership Watch, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries, especially those with left-wing leanings.

He said: ""It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean's elite's thoughts.

""Despite voting no they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable than England, plus North Koreans love whisky.

""Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.""

460,Catholic Priest Claims God Is Female After Clinically Dead Experience,"Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief on Vogue magazine is allegedly displeased with the publications's new 1 World Trade Center offices. Their new workplace at the 25th and 26th floors of the building is said to be infested with rats and vermins. Moving to this new offices may be postponed until the pests are cleared away.

Reportedly, the new 1 WTC offices of Vogue magazine are being swarmed by rodents. Editor-in-child, Anna Wintour, is said to be naturally disgusted and would not step foot into the new offices until these rodents are removed.  The report details that the influential editor-in-chief already asked her staffers to clean her office before she ever set foot in there. Fortunately, Anna Wintour is not yet expected to work in the new offices until 2015. 

A Vogue employee told Gawker last Friday afternoon that the pests cannot be tolerated for work purposes. Moreover, because of the many rodents and vermins scuttling around, the editorial department of the high-caliber magazine might delay its move from the old Times Square offices. The sales and marketing departments have already moved in. The employee added that even though it may sound laughable, but the company is facing a serious concern if these creatures are not removed. The employee explains that there is a possibility that these creatures could nibble the clothing they have in the office.

This rat infestation problem is remarkable considering how excited the company seems to be about moving to their new posh premises. Before this report, Vogue had posted the move in a special online story. The company has also been steadily showing off pictures and videos of the new offices, even Anna Wintour's through Instagram.

Page Six reports that not everyone is sympathetic towards the company.

462,James Foley Killer ‘Jihadi John’ Believed to Be Former London Rapper Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary,"There is so much fake stuff on the Internet in any given week that we’ve grown tired of debunking it all. Fake Twitter fights. Fake DHL ads. Amazing viral video? Nope — a Jimmy Kimmel stunt!

So, rather than take down each and every undeservedly viral story that crosses our monitors each week, we’re rounding them all up in a quick, once-a-week Friday debunk of fake photos, misleading headlines and bad studies that you probably shouldn’t share over the weekend.

Ready? Here’s what was fake on the Internet this week:

1. The Nobel Committee doesn’t “regret” giving President Obama the Peace Prize. According to an invented “news release” uploaded to Scribd by the prominent blogger and anti-war activist David Swanson, the Nobel Institute can’t retract Obama’s 2009 Peace Prize — but wishes it could. “It remains the obligation of the Committee to disassociate itself from actions taken by laureates that frustrate rather than advancing [sic] the fraternity between nations,” the statement reads. (Pro-tip: International organizations rarely make glaring grammatical errors in major statements.) “The Committee therefore joins with the public statements of several Nobel Peace Laureates in expressing its regrets over the conduct of the 2009 prize recipient.” The announcement has since been picked up by a number of right-wing outlets, including Before It’s News. The only problem, of course: It isn’t true.

Dear Internet: The Nobel committee ″regrets” giving Obama the 2009 peace prize story is bogus. I just spoke with the head of the institute

2. There is no-such thing as a “pumpkin-spice-flavored condom.” Though considering the social media response to the idea, some enterprising company may want to give it a try. A Photoshopped image of the “limited edition” Durex condom circulated widely on Twitter and Facebook last week before a punny statement from Durex punctured the hoax: “We can’t claim this one,” the company said, “but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom.” Har har. In unrelated pumpkin-spice news, the limited-edition Oreos of the flavor are apparently quite real.

We’ve officially reached Pumpkin Spice saturation point. pic.twitter.com/Tve77ov5JZ

3. No one expects “record-shattering snowfall” this year. That claim — like so many others! — comes from the unfunny “satirists” at EmpireNews.net, increasingly our least favorite fake-news site in a generally unfavorable field. According to the story and its accompanying map, meteorologists have expected “above normal snowfall” in huge swaths of the United States, including the entire mid-Atlantic coast. Like everything else on Empire News, of course, the map is fake. Moreover, it’s so difficult to predict seasonal weather patterns that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration doesn’t bust theirs out until November, and the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Md., told the Baltimore Sun they have virtually no idea what the snow will look like three long months from now.

#InOtherNews I just read a report that a meteorologist said we will be having ″record shattering snowfall” this winter. Lord Jesus.

4. “Male birth control” will probably not be here by 2017. A number of outlets gleefully proclaimed the news that a “male birth control” injection, called Vasalgel, would be hitting the world’s bedrooms within three years. Alas, that would seem to suggest that Vasalgel has been proven to work in humans, or that it’s already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration — and neither of those things are true. “The news came from a press release — and call for donations! — by the foundation behind Vasalgel,” Julia Belluz explained at Vox, “highlighting some promising (though again, unpublished, anecdotal findings) from testing on baboons.” Bottom line: It’s great that someone’s working on male birth control, but it’s highly unlikely this particular product will reach the U.S. market by 2017.

5. There was not a shooting at a California Marine Corps base. An anonymous Facebook page sparked all-out panic at a base north of San Diego on Thursday night when it posted that a shooter was active at the military installation and that “ALL MARINES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO LOCK THEMSELVES INSIDE OF THEIR ROOMS.” The page then stupidly followed that prank post up with a number of “updates” on the situation, which were liked and shared hundreds of times. Base police told Business Insider there was no evidence at all of a shooting: People “saw if on social media networks and then they started telling their friends,” one dispatcher said. “It’s all rumor, it’s all hearsay.”

Possible shooter in Camp Pendleton!? Anybody hear anything??

6. Shakira is not dead. The singer’s hips don’t lie, but the Internet does. Constantly. A hoax e-mail bearing the logo of Mexican newspaper El Universal claimed that Shakira died in a car accident in Colombia last week, and that an attached Word document contained “exclusive images and details” from the scene. Colombia’s Informador reports that the e-mail may actually have contained a virus or phishing scam. As for Shakira, she’s alive and well and expecting her second child with boyfriend Gerard Pique.

7. British Muslims are not trying to outlaw a beloved children’s TV show. A comedian going by the name Zayn Sheikh outraged many Brits (and fooled a number of news outlets, British and otherwise) with a YouTube video that demanded the TV show “Peppa Pig” go off air and suggested a national campaign would soon organize for that purpose. Peppa Pig is a beloved, alliterative British cartoon character — and also “haram,” or forbidden to Muslims, Sheikh claimed. Over the weekend, Sheikh posted a second video admitting the whole thing was a hoax — but a hoax for a cause. “This video served to show how much Islamophobia is around, for those who deny its existence,” he wrote. “It is sad to live in a society where some feel that Muslims have no rights to talk at all.”

8. Obama will not “resign amid new Benghazi revelations.” Every word of this headline is a dream come true to some of the president’s more conspiracy-minded opponents, which perhaps explains why the fake article, from fake-article-generator National Report, went viral in those circles. As of this writing, it’s been shared more than 60,000 times on Facebook. Even Donald Trump seems to have fallen for the “joke”!

If Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country—I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!

(Just kidding, that tweet is related to another matter entirely.)

9. Cocaine has not been found in Coors Light beer. Since this is the second widespread cocaine-in-a-beverage hoax in as many weeks, let’s get a few things straight about the alleged phenomenon. First up: This hoax seems to do well because it has some remote, and long ago, bases in fact. (Cocaine-laced sodas and beverages were very popular in ye olden days, around the time of the Civil War.) It also helps that remote traces of coca have been found, at some point in time, in various popular beverages, including Red Bull. That said, no cocaine expose published on a site called Huzlers.com is ever going to be real. Ever. How have 286,000 people shared this stupid thing?

10. The ruins of an ancient city were not discovered in the Australian desert. Perhaps the most incredible thing about this faux-story from World News Daily Report — besides the number of times people have reposted it to Facebook — is the amazingly credulous conversation readers are having in the comments section below it. “I thought the climate in central Australia had been arid for over 30,000 years,” one commenter wrote. “30,000 people living in the desert? That would require agriculture and irrigation … That’s just incredible!” Indeed.

463,"Tiger Woods is not on suspension for failing a drug test, his agent and a PGA official say","Nicaraguan officials have appealed for witnesses to a meteorite strike that left a 12m-wide crater near Managua's international airport on Saturday night.

Residents reported a loud boom as the meteorite crashed but scientists said no one had come forward who had seen the streak that a speeding space rock would score across the sky.

""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast,"" Jorge Santamaria told the Associated Press. ""We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave.""

A government spokeswoman, Rosario Murillo, said a team formed to study the event believed the 5m-deep crater was left by a relatively small meteorite that appeared to have come off an asteroid passing close to Earth. She said international scientists had been called in to help with the investigation.

The meteorite may have been a fragment of a house-sized asteroid nicknamed Pitbull, which hurtled past Earth on Sunday night at a distance of 40,000km.

Dan Brown, an astronomer at Nottingham Trent University, said that although the Nicaraguan impact occurred 12 hours before Pitbull passed Earth, Central America was facing the right direction for the strike to be a fragment associated with the asteroid.

Pieces of the asteroid could have broken off during collisions with other rocks in the asteroid belt or through heating when the asteroid swung around the sun.

""It certainly makes absolute sense that people surrounding the impact site heard a loud boom. But a flash of light or bright object should also have been observed before that,"" Brown said.

Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies, told the AP it was unclear whether the meteorite disintegrated or was buried on impact at the site. The meteorite could have exploded in the air and produced a shockwave that made the crater, or struck the ground and left small fragments embedded in the soil.

Witness accounts of the meteorite strike would help scientists confirm when the meteorite struck and the path it took – information that could link it to Pitbull or rule out the asteroid as the source of the rock. Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was strange no one had reported a streak of light. ""We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""

If investigators can find remnants of the meteorite in the crater, then its chemical makeup could be compared with measurements of the larger asteroid taken from ground-based telescopes.

""It's a wake-up call that we need to understand more about the flight paths of asteroids,"" Brown said.",unrelated

News that a recording had surfaced was revealed on CNN, although the network said it had not independently confirmed that the alleged gunshots heard on the tape were from the shooting of the unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri, on Aug. 9.
In the recording, a man who has not been identified is heard speaking when a series of gunshots can be heard in the background. There is a quick pause and then another round of gunshots are fired. According to CNN, the man lives near where Brown was killed and was talking to a friend online at the time, which is how the ambient sound was recorded. The man didn’t realize what he had recorded initially and only later became aware it could be tied to the Brown case.

In addition, the report states that Apple is finishing up work on the Apple Watch’s software, battery life, and inductive charging mechanism.

468,Isis claims it has US airdrop of weapons,"The Apple Watch might be water resistant, according to comments reported by French site iGen (via AppleInsider). Either that or it's a misunderstanding, and we don't really know which. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly told employees at an Apple Store in Berlin that he wears his Apple Watch everywhere, ""even in the shower.""

Apple has not officially designated the Apple Watch as either water proof or water resistant. If Mr. Cook actually said he wears his in the shower, it could indicate that Apple will market the device as one or the other.

The problem is the report is hearsay, and there could be some translation issues. It might even have been a joke. We have no context with which to judge this story. So don't invest too much in this rumor just yet.

In fact, I personally doubt the device is water resistant or proof. Even if the device is sealed, water and touch screens don't typically work well together at all. That would make it a coup for Apple—and if anyone could do it it is Apple—but I'm not expecting a water resistant or proof Apple Watch based on this anecdote.

Then there are the straps. Apple has plastic straps. but I wouldn't want to run the metal ones or leather through a shower.

Bah. I don't like this one at all.

In the meanwhile, Mr. Cook also reportedly says he charges his Apple Watch every night. This is in keeping with the very rough comments from Apple at the device's unveiling in September. At that time, we were told Apple had designed the watch to be charged at night, though the company was unspecific about how long it would actually run.

So yeah, I can believe that hasn't changed, but we still don't have context for the comments.",unrelated
469,Nigeria: hopes for return of kidnapped schoolgirls rise after ceasefire reported,"ABUJA, Nigeria — The leader of Nigeria's Islamist extremist group dashed hopes for the release of 200 kidnapped girls Saturday, denying reports of a truce with the government.

In a new video message, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau says the schoolgirls have converted to Islam and married off. ""The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,"" he says, laughing.

The news goes counter to what the Nigerian government said nearly two weeks ago when it announced a cease-fire deal with the terrorist organization, raising hopes among the families of the kidnapped girls — who were taken from the northeastern Nigerian town of Chibok in April — that their daughters would soon be released.

But as the weeks dragged on with no sign of the kidnapped girls, hopes began to fade.

""I was very excited when I heard the news — I will finally reunite with my daughter,"" said Hamidah Amira, 36, whose 17-year-old daughter was kidnapped. But then desperation set in, especially as Boko Haram abducted dozens of young women and teenagers in northeast Nigeria and continued to launch attacks that forced hundreds to flee.

Despite those incidents, the government insisted negotiations with the Islamists were ongoing in Chad, as some began to raise doubts a cease-fire was even agreed upon by the group.

Martin Ewi, senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies' office in Pretoria, said he didn't think Boko Haram had agreed to a truce, citing the lack of public statements on the issue in the past two weeks.

""The government might be talking to one faction … and then you have the other factions which might not have bought into the idea of dialogue,"" he said.

Human Rights Watch estimates Boko Haram, whose name loosely translates as ""Western education is forbidden,"" has abducted around 500 young women over the past five years.

Although some girls managed to escape from the Islamists, the whereabouts and the fate of the rest of the young women are uncertain.

A recent Human Rights Watch report, based on interviews with victims and witnesses of Boko Haram abductions, offers rare insight into a series of physical and sexual abuses the girls suffer in captivity, including rape, forced labor and beating.

""We found that the Nigerian government has never interviewed these girls, never really found out or learned what they've gone through, never attempted to do any kind of investigations,"" said Rona Peligal, Human Rights Watch deputy director for the Africa Division. ""They were kind of left on their own.""

Chibok resident Solomon Ali is deeply critical of the government's handling of the situation since the beginning.

""We were disappointed that the government has done nothing to ensure these girls are released,"" he said, adding officials have failed to keep the community informed.

Outraged by the kidnappings and the atrocities committed by Boko Haram, the international community has urged the Nigerian government to step up its efforts to free the girls. Since April, a campaign under the motto ""Bring Back Our Girls"" went viral on social media.

Peligal says Nigerian authorities should do a better job responding to the Boko Haram threat and ensuring protection around schools.

""The government needs to better anticipate and plan for those kinds of abductions because they're continuing,"" she said. ""And the government should respond capably.""

Ewi worries the girls would not be freed unless the government yields to Boko Haram's demands to release some of their militants.

""You can't pursue military operations and still be hoping to release the girls alive,"" he said.

Analysts warn the situation is likely to get worse in the months ahead of the 2015 election. Earlier this week, President Goodluck Jonathan, who is under increasing scrutiny for his failure to locate the girls, confirmed he would be running for re-election.

""The Boko Haram issue has been indeed politicized, and I expect it would be further politicized as we get closer to the election,"" said Peligal.

In the meantime, Amira — like other moms — waits, while making a personal appeal to Boko Haram to release her daughter and the other girls.

""They should sympathize with us, not with the government,"" Amira said.

471,Meteorite leaves crater in Nicaraguan capital Managua,"A MYSTERIOUS explosion that rocked Nicaragua’s crowded capital Managua, creating a large crater, appears to have been caused by a small meteorite.

Amazingly, in a sprawling city of 1.2 million people, the impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries, but it did leave a crater measuring 12 metres across and was felt throughout the capital late on Saturday.

Nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed “2014 RC,” which passed very close to Earth yesterday and was estimated by astronomers to be about 20 metres big, or the size of a house.

“We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact,” said Wilfredo Strauss of the Seismic Institute.

The meteorite appeared to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport around midnight and the hit was so large that it registered on the instruments Strauss’s organisation uses to size up earthquakes.

“You can see two waves: first, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth, and then another stronger one, which is the impact of the sound,” he said.

Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday. One of them, William Martinez, said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil.

“You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,” Martinez said.

Government spokeswoman, First Lady Rosario Murillo, said Managua would be in contact with the US Geological Service to try to get more information about “this fascinating event” in the Central American nation, one of Latin America’s poorest countries.

People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion, and that liquid, sand and dust were blown through the air, which smelled like something had burned.

There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot, and flights at the airport were not affected.

NASA said last week that the asteroid 2014 RC, at the time of closest approach, would be approximately one-tenth the distance from the centre of Earth to the moon, or about 40,000 kilometres.

It had been projected to be roughly over New Zealand at the time of its closest approach.

474,Has Ebola infected Isis militants in Mosul?,"A new survey from UBS suggests that the Apple Watch could get off to a strong start, leading the investment firm to predict sales of 24 million units and gross profit of $3.4 billion from the wearable device in its first few months alone.

In its poll of 4,000 consumers, UBS found that 10 percent of consumers said they are ""very likely"" to buy a smartwatch in the next 12 months. Applying that same percentage to the total number of eligible iPhone owners, UBS believes Apple will sell 24 million Apple Watches in its first nine months of availability.

Detailing the results in a note to investors on Monday, analyst Steven Milunovich noted that the first version of the Apple Watch has a number of limitations, most notably its dependence on a connected iPhone for functionality. But he believes the first-generation device will set up Apple for long-term success in the wearables market.

Still, in the first few months, Milunovich believes Apple will sell 24 million of its Watch with an average price between $420 and $430. That would result in sales of $10.3 billion, and with an assumed 33 percent level of gross margin, would add $3.4 billion in profit to the company's bottom line for fiscal 2015.

Apple's fiscal 2015 concludes at the end of September, so Milunovich's estimates don't include the 2015 holiday shopping season.

Looking to fiscal 2016, Milunovich's estimates increase to 40 million units, resulting in $17 billion in sales and $6.2 billion in profit. And by 2018, his projections call for Apple to be selling 67.6 million Apple Watch units in a single fiscal year.

The analyst said it's likely that the iPhone and Apple Watch will prove to be complementary products, much like the Mac and iPad. But he said it's also possible that the Apple Watch could eventually become the successor to the iPhone.

""Given that two-thirds of Apple's profit is generated by the iPhone, the company has to be concerned about the longer-term threat of replacement technology, whether it be a leap in handset technology or loss of key functions to wearables,"" Mulinovich said. ""With a sophisticated user interface and third-party apps coming on, Apple may be readying for the time when the Apple Watch encroaches on the smartphone market.""

The UBS survey also delved into specific brands, and found that for now consumers are more interested in the currently available Samsung Gear. Among respondents who plan to buy a smartwatch, 37 percent said they would purchase a SamsungGear, while 25 percent said they are waiting for the Apple Watch.

Milunovich expects the tables to quickly turn in early 2015, when the Apple Watch becomes available and shakes up the existing wearables market.

""Just as Apple wasn't the first MP3 or smartphone vendor but redefined those categories, we expect Apple Watch to become first to mind in smartwatches,"" he said.

UBS has maintained its ""buy"" rating for AAPL stock with a 12-month price target of $125.",unrelated
475,Was The Batmobile Stolen In Detroit?,"NORTH Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg, a source with access to North Korea’s leadership said yesterday, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old’s health and grip on power.

North Korea’s state media, which usually chronicles Kim’s whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on September 3.

The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.

“He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part, too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,” the source said on condition of anonymity.

“He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened.”

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.

Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source.

“Kim Jong Un is in total control,” added the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang.

North Korean officials have denied that Kim’s public absence is health-related and a United States official following North Korea said this week there were no indications that he was seriously ill or in political trouble. It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.

In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.

He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.

Speculation that Kim’s unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a TV report late last month that said he was suffering from “discomfort.”

Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit last Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.

The source with knowledge of Kim’s health said rumors of a coup were “rubbish.”

Kim was absent from a September 25 meeting of the Supreme People’s Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.

However, Kim’s name has not disappeared from state propaganda. Yesterday’s edition of the Workers’ Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page.",unrelated
476,Apple Watch mass production kicks off in January: Report,"Online retail giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.98%  plans to open its first brick-and-mortar store, according to people familiar with the plans.

The site, set to open in time for the holiday-shopping season on Manhattan’s busy 34th Street, would mark an experiment by Amazon to connect with customers in the physical world. Amazon has built its business on competitive pricing and fast shipping. Until now, though, it couldn’t compete with the immediacy of a traditional store.

Amazon’s space at 7 West 34th St., across from the Empire State Building in Midtown, would function as a mini-warehouse, with limited inventory for same-day delivery within New York, product returns and exchanges, and pickups of online orders.

Opening a physical location is “about marketing the Amazon brand,” said Matt Nemer, a Wells Fargo analyst. “Same-day delivery, ordering online and picking up in store are ideas that are really catching on. Amazon needs to be at the center of that.”

Amazon also may consider using the space to showcase inventory, particularly its devices like the Kindle e-readers, Fire smartphone or Fire TV set-top box, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking.

Operating stores also carries risks. Until now, Amazon has largely avoided some costs associated with retailing, including leases, paying employees and managing inventory in hundreds of stores. Those expenses could imperil the company’s already thin profit margins.

Some details about the New York store couldn't be learned immediately, including the size, length of the lease or amount of inventory that would be housed there. People familiar with the matter cautioned that Amazon’s plans could change, and that the store is an experiment and could be deemed unsuccessful.

If it is successful, however, the New York location could presage a rollout to other U.S. cities, according to the people familiar with the company’s thinking.

Amazon has studied opening a brick-and-mortar outlet for years, even scouting locations in its hometown Seattle about two years ago before scrapping the idea, said another person familiar with the effort. Amazon once sold Kindles in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. outlets, but those retailers pulled the devices from shelves two years ago in an apparent nod to Amazon’s growing power in retailing.

The 12-story building on 34th Street, owned by Vornado Realty Trust, once housed an Ohrbach’s department store and now has Mango and Express stores at street level. There are two loading docks at the back of the building.

The Amazon store will be in the shadow of the Empire State Building, which last year attracted 4.3 million visitors to its observatory. It is a block east of Herald Square, where Macy’s Inc. flagship store draws more than 20 million annual visitors, according to the 34th Street Partnership, a business-improvement district.

“Foot traffic on 34th Street is unparalleled,” said Chase Welles, executive vice president at SCG Retail, a real-estate service company.

The streetscape of 34th Street has changed dramatically since the 1990s, when it was populated by low-end retailers. Since then, the business-improvement district and area companies have spent about $2 billion on upgrades to the neighborhood and individual properties, according to the 34th Street Partnership. Global and national retailers such as Zara, Uniqlo and Vince Camuto have opened stores on the street.

Vornado Chief Financial Officer Stephen Theriot hailed the 34th Street building on a recent conference call with analysts. “As a former department store, it’s got very high ceilings, it is got big, open floor plates, and that’s the type of property that a lot of the creative class tenants” favor, he said.


Amazon has studied opening a brick-and-mortar outlet for years, even scouting locations in its hometown Seattle about two years ago before scrapping the idea. Bloomberg
Ordering online with the option to pick up in stores has proved popular; retailers including Wal-Mart, Home Depot Inc. and Macy’s, offer the service. Others employ delivery services such as Google Inc., eBay Inc. or startup Deliv Inc. to fetch orders from stores, rather than warehouses, and bring them to customers.

Amazon has experimented with physical stores before, including pop-up shops and locations run by subsidiaries. Last November, Kindle-brand pop-ups appeared in U.S. malls, selling e-readers and tablets from vending machines. Its Zappos unit has a store near its Kentucky distribution center and once operated a few outlets in its hometown Las Vegas; and its Quidsi unit runs a cosmetics store in Manhasset, N.Y.

Amazon also has set up large metal lockers in convenience stores and parking garages around the country, to accommodate deliveries and returns. The lockers don’t offer same-day delivery, however. The lockers have been a popular option and Amazon has expanded them to a number of cities, including overseas, after initially just offering them in Seattle.

Amazon took some inspiration from a trial by the U.K.’s Home Retail Group PLC, allowing customers to order eBay goods online and pick them up in its Argos stores, said one person familiar with Amazon’s thinking. By year’s end Argos expects to provide the service at 650 stores from 65,000 eBay sellers.

Other primarily online retailers have opened physical storefronts, including clothier Bonobos Inc., eyeglasses purveyor Warby Parker, and subscription beauty-products service Birchbox.

New York-based Bonobos opened its first of 10 retail stores in 2011; it plans 40 by 2016, said Chief Executive Andy Dunn. The stores offer limited inventory so customers can determine their size and choose styles and patterns; the merchandise is then shipped to their home from a warehouse, or can be collected later in-store.

Mr. Dunn said customers who order clothing from Bonobos brick-and-mortar stores spend roughly twice as much as online shoppers.",unrelated

479,WFB’s Bill Gertz: Obama Administration ‘Trying to Play Down’ Missing Libyan Airliners,"(CNN) -- Boko Haram laughed off Nigeria's announcement of a ceasefire agreement, saying there is no such deal and schoolgirls abducted in spring have been converted to Islam and married off.

Nigerian officials announced two weeks ago that they had struck a deal with the Islamist terror group.

The deal, the government said, included the release of more than 200 girls whose kidnapping in April at a boarding school in the nation's north stunned the world.

In a video released Saturday, the Islamist group's notorious leader fired off a series of denials.

""Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?"" Abubakar Shekau said. ""They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.""

Shekau slammed reports of their planned release.

""We married them off. They are in their marital homes,"" he said, chuckling.

The group's leader also denied knowing the negotiator with whom the government claimed it worked out a deal, saying he does not represent Boko Haram.

""We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,"" he said of the negotiator.

It wasn't clear when the video was made.

Mike Omeri, coordinator of Nigeria's National Information Centre, told CNN on Saturday that all these claims contradict those made in conversations in which the Nigerian government has been involved.

Omeri said Nigeria's government will do everything possible to verify the claims made in the video.

Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to the aide.

The ceasefire deal announced October 17 followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.

After the deal was announced, the aide said final negotiations on the girls' release would be completed at a meeting a week later in Chad.

That day passed without any signs of the girls.

Boko Haram a growing challenge

In the video, Shekau talked not of peace but of more violence -- promising more ""war, striking and killing with gun.""

This strategy appears to be playing out in parts of Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire. More people have been abducted and scores killed in recent weeks, including one attack a day after the ceasefire that left eight dead.

Days later, members of the Islamist terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria, residents said Thursday.

Heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted, residents said.

For its part, the Nigerian government isn't backing down.

Rather, it is stepping up its military campaign against militants and criminals in some parts of the West African nation, Nigeria's defense ministry said on Saturday.

The military claimed its airstrikes and ground operations have repelled attacks against civilians in Adamawa and Borno, two of the states in northeastern Nigeria that have been strongholds and frequent targets for Boko Haram.

Officials are ""studying"" the latest video, even as the military continues to recognize the talks aimed at assuring the release of the kidnapped schoolgirls, the ministry said.

Boko Haram, whose name translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the Hausa language, is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Like ISIS, it has ambitions for a caliphate, or religious state.

The group's attacks have intensified in recent years in an apparent show of defiance for the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the government.

As part of its insurgency, it has bombed schools, churches and mosques, kidnapped women and children and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

480,Macaulay Culkin dead: The death hoax is once again on the child actor,"WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon says U.S. officials have confirmed the death of the leader of the al-Shabaab terror group in a U.S. airstrike on Monday.

The Pentagon's press secretary confirmed the death of Ahmed Abdi Godane in a brief written statement Friday.
""Godane's removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al Qaeda affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals,"" the White House said in a statement.

U.S. officials had said after the strike on Monday that U.S. special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions. But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday.

Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is the group's spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al Qaeda.

The U.S. has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia recent years.

A U.S. missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabaab, and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a U.S. strike that killed al-Shabaab's top explosives expert.

Al-Shabaab gained international notoriety a year ago this month when it attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people. The U.S. strike on Monday targeted Godane and other planners of the bloody assault on the mall, officials said.",unrelated
481,Kim Jong ill? Analysts say 27-year-old sister Kim Yo Jong may be running North Korea (VIDEO),"A woman who claims to be Michael Phelp’s girlfriend has revealed she was born with male genitalia – and says she never told the swimmer.

Taylor Lianne Chandler, who also described her ‘amazing intimacy’ with the athlete, admitted on Facebook that her birth name was David Roy Fitch.

Olympic medallist Michael Phelps is currently in rehab at the moment due to a six-month ban from swimming due to driving under the influence.

The 41-year-old, who is technically ‘intersex’, was born with both male genitalia and a uterus but had neither ovaries nor testicles.

She was technically listed as a boy on her birth certificate at first but was eventually ‘medically diagnosed’ as intersex rather than being male or female in her early teens.

She underwent corrective surgery in her early twenties to remove her penis as well as taking testosterone blockers and changing her name.

However, she reveals that she never told the 29-year-old athlete as it ‘never came up’. She suspects he may now leave her after her public admission.

She wrote in the Facebook post: ‘I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.’

482,Who Is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau? Ottawa Shooter Suspect Identified By Canadian Officials ,"If you’ve seen a story floating around on your Facebook feed about Banksy getting arrested and exposed, don’t worry because Banksy is still anonymous and well. The hoax was the work of a “satirical” news site called The National Report — which I’m not linking because f*ck those guys — that makes up fake stories that sound like they could be ostensibly true, usually without a trace of actual satire, as filthy, filthy clickbait. It’s an awful yet unfortunately effective business model.

In a story which was published early this morning, The National Report claimed that Banksy was arrested in London by a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force and revealed to be a 35-year-old man named Paul Horner. The International Business Times did some quick fact checking and exposed the story to be a hoax:

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users $2.99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15-year-old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager’s house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4.

The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics, a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who, unsurprisingly since his previous stories include ‘Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month’ and ‘Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis’, has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism.

483,GOP Rep: ‘At Least Ten ISIS Fighters Have Been Caught Coming Across The Mexican Border’,"WASHINGTON (CBS DC) – Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., says that at least ten fighters for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have been apprehended while attempting to enter the southern U.S. border.
The California Republican claims that “at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” in a conversation with Fox News on Tuesday. Hunter says that the Islamic terrorists are slipping into the U.S. through the porous southern border as several have already been captured.
“There’s nobody talking about it,” Rep. Hunter told Fox. “If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border. It’s that simple…They caught them at the border, therefore we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or ten of them then you know there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol.”
In August, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, warned that the open border posed an “immediate threat” for terrorist activity infiltrating the country. The government watchdog group, Judicial Watch, said ISIS terrorists were “planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.”
Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said that the 1,933-mile southern border with Mexico is the obvious entry point for Islamic State terrorists. He says that information regarding the capture of Islamic State terrorists crossing the border comes directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
“ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming through the southern border – which they already have,” he added.
“They aren’t flying B-1 bombers, bombing American cities,” said Hunter. “But they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico…All you have to do is ask the border patrol.”
The Department of Homeland Security released a statement on Wednesday that claims alleging Islamic State militants have been apprehended at the Mexican border are “categorically false.”
“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement today. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”
After Hunter’s comments to Fox, one of his sources nuanced their claims, saying that some of those apprehended at the border might be ISIS-affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army – one of many ISIS enemies.
In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for Hunter said he was not backing down on the claims.
“The Congressman was conveying what he knows — and what he was told,” the spokesperson told ABC. “It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing — it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

484,'Spiderman' squished: Perth experts debunk spider burrowing claims,"An Australian tourist’s holiday in Bali ended horrifyingly when doctors were forced to pull a tropical spider out of his stomach.

Medical staff at Bali International Medical Centre said the spider had burrowed itself into Dylan Thomas’s skin through a scar from where his appendix had been removed.

The 21-year-old, from Bunbury, Western Australia, told NT News he woke up on Saturday morning to find a 2-inch red trail rising up from his stomach.

Later that day it had risen two or three inches higher up his body, he said.

When he first went to doctors on Sunday they told him it was an insect bite and gave him some cream, NT News reported.

By Monday morning the trail had started to blister.

Then Thomas saw a dermatologist, who recognised things were not right.

Doctors operated and removed a spider the size of a match head from his body.

Thomas told NT News:

“It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated.

“It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days.”

The spider, which was dead when it was removed, has been sent off for tests, and Thomas is expected to learn what species it was in the coming days. He summed up his experience on Thursday:

The Bunbury Mail said Thomas was now hoping his friends would help him raise enough money for a Spider-Man tattoo on his chest.

He is also apparently hoping the ordeal leaves a “gnarly scar” on his body.

update

A number of scientists in Perth have now cast doubt over Thomas’ claims and said the red trail may have been caused by a mite rather than a spider.

The Cambodia eaterie
Leader Kim Jong-Un has already opened a diner in Amsterdam, with the 'Pyongyang' chain of restaurants also having branches in China and parts of Asia.

It has been reported that the dictator is believed to be interested in opening another in the UK, with claims by observers of North Korea that Kim is especially keen on an eaterie in Scotland.

His fondness of whisky and the profile of Scotland's referendum have been cited as key reasons for the potential serving of North Korean delicacies such as dog meat soup and pine-nut gruel in Scotland.

Proceeds from the 'Pyongyang' chain are funnelled back into North Korean government funds.

Michael Madden, editor of North Korea Leadership Watch, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries, especially those with left-wing leanings.

He said: ""It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean's elite's thoughts.

""Despite voting no they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable than England, plus North Koreans love whisky.

488,"Sorry, KFC isn't going to be selling weed in Colorado restaurants","A hallucinogenic fungi has been found growing in the Queen’s garden at Buckingham Palace after being discovered by gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh.

The television presenter unearthed the fungi at Buckingham Palace for an ITV gardening show called The Queen’s Garden, and said: “I won’t be eating any of that.”

Titchmarsh came across the red and white spotted toadstool — called Amanita muscaria, or fly agaric — on a tour of the private 40-acre plot with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley.

Titchmarsh, 65, asks in an ITV show to be screened on Christmas Day: “Is it edible?”

Professor Crawley replies: “That depends what you mean. It’s eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic affects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

“The old-fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness.”

Titchmarsh jokingly replies: “I think I’ll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms.”

Then he adds: “Not something to try at home.”

Later he told The Sun newspaper: “That was a surprise but it shows just how varied the species are. I won’t be eating any of that, though, no. My idea of hard drugs is Nurofen.”

On the new TV show, Titchmarsh explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools.

He says: “Every time they chop something down, they leave out the wood to rot.”

Magic mushroom is a slang term for any hallucinogenic fungus.

The most common, illegal form contains drug psilocybin, but there is no suggestion this grows in the Palace garden.

Last night a Palace spokesman told the Sun: “For the avoidance of doubt, fungi from the garden are not used in the Palace kitchens.”

The new programme will show viewers an entire year in the life of the Buckingham Palace garden, from the summer garden parties to the nocturnal wanderings of wildlife in the heart of London.

It will demonstrate how gardeners work tirelessly to maintain the Queen’s flowers, while bearing in mind her wish to see animals and insects made welcome in the gardens, swapping pesticides for homemade garlic treatments.

Titchmarsh will explore how bee hives, homes for insects and deposits from the Royal mews each help cultivate the gardens of Buckingham Palace, with top tips from gardeners giving insight into the Queen’s own tastes.

The programme, to be broadcast by ITV on Christmas Day, will also show how the garden has been used by the royal family for generations, from the king who planted mulberry trees to rival the French to the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret climbing to peer over the high garden walls.

A sandpit used by the royal children will be filmed, along with oak trees planted decades ago by the young Prince of Wales and Princess Royal, grown from acorns sown on the event of their birth.

Over the summer, Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante, John Temple — a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii — to be the president for audience and products, putting him in a position above Eric Bates, the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director, who is close to Taibbi.

The “leave of absence” also comes three months after I first reported that Omidyar had apparently ordered Taibbi to change his strategy away from purely covering corporate fatcats (like, uh, Pierre Omidyar) to a wider mission, involving more comedy than reporting. Around the same time I heard rumors that Eric Bates was also unhappy at the organization.

I’ve previously had a… uh… spirited email conversation with Taibbi about both claims, although Taibbi would only engage on the condition that his words were “not for publication” — a strange demand coming from an editor at a site that’s about leaking confidential documents. I emailed Taibbi again today to ask if I can publish his responses in the light of today’s news. He replied: “No, you may not.”

Here then, for what little it’s worth, is my side of the correspondence, from back in July, in which I laid out the state of First Look as I saw it (with a little help from some well placed sources.) The discussion was… uh… spirited on both sides. All words below are mine — you’ll just have to try to infer what Taibbi’s stated position might have been.

A note on not for publication / off the record: I thought carefully about the ethics of publishing even my half of a “not for publication” conversation. Given First Look’s own policy of publishing confidential documents and the fact that it seems clear Taibbi wasn’t being entirely truthful about his place at the company, I ultimately came down on the side of publishing my own responses, with Taibbi’s words redacted. I’m sure some readers with disagree — I welcome the discussion.

Also, an important disclosure: Taibbi previously worked with Pando’s Mark Ames on Russian ex-pat newspaper, the Exile. It has been widely reported that the two are no longer on speaking terms. I didn’t discuss this post with Mark before publishing.

Ok, here are the emails…

[The email thread began with Taibbi's emailing me to deny that Omidyar had changed his strategy. I had emailed First Look for comment on my story before publication but received no reply. Taibbi's email was headed ""Not for publication.""]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 [Redacted Taibbi quote, denying my story] Right, but that’s not the part that seems to have changed. What’s changed is that Omidyar’s description of the site yesterday made zero mention of wall street. It’s gone from finance first to politics first. More broadly, and happy to stay off the record, there’s clearly something weird going on over there. Why does a 250m journalism project have to shift focus before it’s launched? It suggests PO has no clue how to handle talent and so is retreating back to technology.

[Taibbi responded, with questions of his own. Here's my reply...]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 I don’t think [Omidyar] took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends. I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life, or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over. Knowing what I do about his management style I’m leaning towards the latter. But I emailed you because I actually want to understand what’s going on.

[Taibbi responded again. And I replied again...]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 [Redacted.] If I waited for Pierre and his staffers to respond to questions I’d never publish a thing about First Look. I’ve given PO 48hrs to respond before, and still got nothing. I’m sure you’ve always held stories indefinitely until you receive a response? As for your bizarre chain of straw man arguments — I didn’t say he’d hired you to shut you up. So, no, I don’t [believe] something you just made up. As you say, that would be real [redacted] analysis. Here’s what I believe… I don’t think Pierre has any idea why he hired you, and I don’t think you’re entirely sure either. Perhaps he was looking for names that looked good on a press release and you fit the bill. I think you’re tired, and I think you knew the Rolling Stone gig wasn’t going to last for ever. I think PO offered you complete editorial freedom and promised you a blank check to build your own team. For that reason, I think Omidyar’s announcement yesterday should be terrifying to you, and to anyone else who works at FLM. He’s lost his nerve — for a combination of reasons — and is retreating to something he understands: Technology and platforms. I’ve spoken to people who have known Omidyar for decades and people who have worked with him on previous publications — if you seriously think he’s going to have your back when you go after his pals you’re more naive than… well, than you are. I’m tired of this conversation now. I honestly can’t tell if you’re being a team player, or if you believe any of this crap. I’m sure I’ll continue to cover FLM and I’ll continue to ask for comment when I do. It’s entirely up to you if you respond before publication or wait until afterwards and then bitch on Twitter. Either way, I’ll continue to read your Wall St stuff if/when you publish it — just as I read, and enjoyed, your most recent book on a long flight a few weeks back. Best of luck, Paul

[Taibbi responded again.]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Wed, Jul 30, 2014 I’m tired of it because you refuse to actually engage in conversation. I’ve laid out my position, clearly and honestly, and asked follow up questions. You won’t actually address any of my points — you just keep lobbing back straw men and not engaging with what I’m saying. At the very least you’ve turned into a corporate flack for First Look: Continuing to hammer away at a caricatured version of what I said, while refusing to answer questions, and demanding that the whole thing stay off the record so that readers continue to be left in the dark. The last person who tried that line of attack over a Pando story was Lanny Davis. [Redacted] I’ve told you what I believe, but I’ll humor you — and your enjoyment at playing PR flack — by saying it again, this time line by line… [Redacted Taibbi quote] I think it’s unlikely Pierre *ordered* you to stop writing about Wall Street. I’d say the odds [are] almost zero. He’s not that fucking stupid. Here’s what I said “No, of course I don’t think he took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends. I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life, or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over.” Here’s my question, which you don’t seem keen to answer: Did you know Pierre was going to leave finance out of his post about what your editorial mission would be? If not, doesn’t that worry you? If so, what is the reasoning behind not mentioning the thing that you are best known for but which is likely to make your sole funder and boss the most uncomfortable? A follow-up question: What are we to make of the fact that First Look journalists — Greenwald in particular — insist that Pierre has no control over editorial (indeed you’ve insisted similar in this conversation) and yet he’s the one laying out the company’s editorial plan? Why wouldn’t that be the job of the actual editors? Instead we have your $250m funder issuing a statement that marginalizes the one aspect of your work that might sting him while reassuring the world that — don’t worry! — he intends to permit you and Greenwald to continue doing your jobs, but that he has decided to axe plans for all the other editorial sites he previously (in a video starring him) said he would fund. What does the phrase “editorial independence” actually mean at First Look? [Redacted Taibbi quote] I think that’s what he told you when you were first hired, yes. People are told lots of things on first dates. [Redacted Taibbi quote] I’ve never said otherwise. That’s a total red herring. [Redacted Taibbi quote] [Redacted] I didn’t mention anything in my story about Pierre ordering you to stop writing (because, as I’ve made clear, I don’t believe that would make any sense); I didn’t mention what I suspect you might have been told when you were hired (because, again, I don’t know. What I know — and what I wrote — is that the public statements about your mission have changed); I didn’t mention it being a satirical publication because that hasn’t changed. [Redacted Taibbi quote] A press release about what your job and focus will be, written by the man who writes your pay checks and who is backing down on almost all of the editorial strategy that was in place when you were hired. A press release that was at odds with all previous statements about what your focus will be; specifically leaving out the one thing that would seem to have the potential to make Omidyar most concerned. Yes, I believe that means you will be focussing far less on that aspect of things and, yes, I believe that it’s either a choice you’ve consciously made, or a choice Pierre is attempting to make for you through passive aggressive public messaging. Your choice of denial is interesting. “[Redacted]” That’s the same line Greenwald used when he was challenged on whether he would write about Pierre’s business interests. Clear enough to sound like a denial, but general enough to allow you to focus most of your energies away from Wall Street. Do you at least concede that previously the chief focus of your site was to be on finance and now it’s on politics and “culture”? If the *main focus* of the site still on uncovering financial corruption? Yes or no? If yes, why did your boss mischaracterize the site so badly in his blog post, and if no, why not? [Redacted Taibbi quote] Pierre has been interfering with First Look’s editorial plans from the start. Every single editorial plan First Look has exists only at Pierre’s pleasure. He is your sole funder and he is the one making public statements about how he intends to allocate those resources. How is it possible you understand Wall Street so well but don’t understand that? [Redacted Taibbi quote] Yes, that is what’s apparent from Omidyar’s statement. [Redacted Taibbi quote] I had plenty of information, and printed what I knew, after giving you the opportunity to respond before publication. I’d have plenty more information to set the record straight if you’d answer any of the questions above. Or better still, stop hiding behind “not for publication.” Why, if you’re being so unfairly maligned, won’t you let any of the above be shared with readers? Isn’t the whole basis of First Look to make all the information public and let readers decide? Why doesn’t that apply to conversations about First Look and its billionaire owner? Which leads me to my last question: Have you, or any first look staffer to the best of your knowledge, signed an NDA or non disparagement contract — either as a standalone or as part of your employment contract(s)? You’re right, this is an enjoyable conversation! Now let’s shift it up a gear and get to some real answers. Paul

Despite previously saying he was enjoying our conversation, Taibbi stopped responding when I asked him he had signed any kind of contract restricting his freedom to talk openly about First Look.

When I emailed him earlier today, I asked if he had anything to add to his previous comments. He replied: “Just that your story was wrong then and still is.”",agree

The hoaxer behind the fake news story has covered the website in adverts, which should be highly profitable.

Despite the flaws in the story, everyone lost their stuff because the headline was already all over the internet.

491,Unverified video shows beheading of aid worker David Haines,"We've heard rumors for some time that Apple's been less than pleased with the purported battery life of its upcoming Apple Watch. And now, it looks as though it has plenty of reason to be worried. According to a new report from 9 to 5 Mac, the Apple Watch the battery is looking at just 2.5 to 4 hours of ""active application use"" before it dies. Yeesh.

According to 9 to 5 Mac's report, while Apple (along with everyone else who's had their eyes on one) was hoping its Watch would last for at least a full day on a single charge, it's had to significantly change its tune thanks to the power-sucking Retina screen and A5 processor:

As of 2014, Apple wanted the Watch to provide roughly 2.5 to 4 hours of active application use versus 19 hours of combined active/passive use, 3 days of pure standby time, or 4 days if left in a sleeping mode. Sources, however, say that Apple will only likely achieve approximately 2-3 days in either the standby or low-power modes…

But if you're hoping to use the Apple Watch for fitness tracking, there is (sort of?) better news: ""Apple expects to see better battery life when using the Watch's fitness tracking software, which is targeted for nearly 4 hours of straight exercise tracking on a single charge. "" Which, sure, is better than the two-and-a-half hours you'd get under normal heavy use, but there's no way this is going to be tracking more than the lone workout.

As a point of comparison, the Moto 360 easily lasts a full day of mixed-use. Our own Eric Limer's watch still had a little under half of its battery left after about 16-hours of wear. Even the Samsung Gear S, which is essentially a full-fledged phone for your wrist, can go a full day easy. And of course, the Pebble Smartwach, which is admittedly a very different beast, can last close to a full week on a single charge.

Still, while these numbers certainly seem awful, most people probably aren't going to be browsing Facebook and playing games on their wrist four hours. Apple expects most people to be wearing the Watch passively for the majority of the day, but while they were originally shooting for about 19 hours of ""mixed usage,"" 9 to 5 Mac's sources say that Apple no longer thinks it can even hit that—at least not in this first generation.

We've reached out to Apple for comment, and will update as soon as we hear back. [9 to 5 Mac]",unrelated

493,"Man cuts off manhood, throws it in the bin, after girlfriend leaves over small penis","ISIS supporters are circulating images of a child they say has become the youngest foreign fighter to be killed in battle for the jihadist group, according a counter-extremism think tank.

The images, which cannot be independently verified, show a young boy believed to be about 10-years-old holding guns, posing with a balaclava stretched across his face and standing alongside a man thought to be his father who is reportedly a militant.

Those sharing the pictures are paying tribute to the child on Twitter as the youngest martyr from the Arabian Peninsula to have been killed in Syria as Isis tries to establish a caliphate across swathes of the region, according to Charlie Cooper, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation.

Mr Cooper said the images have been circulated on social media with hashtags translated as 'martyrdom of the cub of Baghdadi and his father'. It is claimed that reports of his death first emerged on 26 September and that he was killed fighting alongside his father.

The child's alleged death comes after an Australian man fighting for Isis posted a picture online showing his young son holding the severed head of a Syrian soldier in August, with the caption: ""That's my boy.""

In the same month, a report by the United Nations Human Rights Council found Isis affiliated groups have recruited, trained and used children in active combat roles.

It also found Isis has established training camps to recruit children into armed roles, where they would receive weapons training and religious education. In Raqqa, children as young as ten were being recruited and trained by Isis.

495,"Managua explosion not a meteorite, NASA suggests","Nicaraguan officials say a meteorite gouged out a crater near the nation's capital city over the weekend, but scientists aren't so sure.

A committee formed by the Nicaraguan government determined that a new, 39-foot-wide (12 meters) crater found near the capital Managua's international airport was blasted out by a space rock strike Saturday night (Sept. 6), the Associated Press reported.

Some Managua residents reported hearing a loud boom on Saturday, which would be consistent with a meteorite impact. But other details warrant a healthy dose of skepticism, said Bill Cooke, head of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. [Nicaraguan Crater Possibly Caused by Meteorite (Video)]
""Something that produced a crater this big should have also produced an incredibly bright fireball in the night sky,"" Cooke said. ""And no one reports a fireball, even though it was near midnight under scattered clouds.""
Further, Managua is a big city, with lots of potential witnesses to such a night-sky sight. People saw a bright fireball the last time Cooke can recall a meteorite blasting out a crater on Earth, in September 2007 near the Peruvian village of Carancas — and that impact occurred in broad daylight.

A meteorite strike would also likely leave blackened fragments of the impacting body behind as evidence, both Cooke and meteor expert Peter Jenniskens said.

""If this crater has anything to do with a meteoroid impact, I would expect meteorites to be found in and around the crater,"" Jenniskens, of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute in Mountain View, California, told Space.com via email.

No such pieces have been reported, and none are visible in photos of the crater, Cooke said.

""So I'm kind of skeptical of a meteoritic origin for this crater,"" he said.

If a space rock did indeed carve out the Nicaraguan crater, the meteorite was likely relatively small — about 3 feet (1 m) wide if made of iron, and somewhat larger if composed of rocky material, Cooke added.

Some Nicaraguan officials have speculated that the purported meteorite may be a piece of the asteroid 2014 RC, which flew by Earth on Sunday (Sept. 7), the AP reported. But that is not the case, experts said.

""For those wondering, the event in Nicaragua (poss meteorite?) is unrelated to asteroid 2014 RC.

496,"No, A Spider Did Not Burrow Under A Man's Skin And Live There For Days","AUSTRALIA — A man in Australia has been dubbed “Spider Man” after a bizarre turn of events during a trip to Bali.

A mark on Dylan Maxwell’s belly may look like a gruesome scar, but he says it’s actually the trail left by a spider that burrowed under his skin.

The tiny tropical spider burrowed through a small appendix scar and traveled up into his torso, leaving a red, scar-like trail from his naval to his chest. It survived there for three days.



Maxwell was visiting Indonesia when he says noticed what he thought was a scratch about an inch-long.

He went to a doctor who told him it was a small insect bite, but the trail kept growing up toward his chest.

Maxwell described it as “a very searing, hot searing burning sensation. It was like nothing I’ve ever felt before.”

When it started to blister, he says he got worried.

That’s when they realized the spider has crawled in through the scar.

He says doctors were able to pull the spider out. The spider was placed in a container and shipped off for testing.



Still, many are unconvinced because Dylan has not produced records of the account. And experts say that there aren’t really accounts of spiders burrowing inside people skins. Snopes.com has some discussion about Dylan’s claim.

I think this is extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible. Simply put: it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might ‘crawl beneath skin through a scar’. The claim that it was ‘feeding and moving up through the scar tissue’ defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders. I am also skeptical because the ‘evidence’ (the spider itself) is not presented.",discuss

499,"Yemen says U.S. man freed, sister says he’s dead","The Pentagon has confirmed that Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab, was killed in a US air strike earlier this week.

The United States previously said that the strike inside Somalia had targeted Godane, but did not know whether he had been killed.

“We have confirmed that Ahmed Godane, the co-founder of al-Shabaab, has been killed,” said rear admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, describing it as a “major symbolic and operational loss” for the militant group, which aligned itself with al-Qaida.

Al-Shabaab is fighting to topple Somalia’s western-backed government and regularly launches bombings and gun attacks against state targets and civilians. Godane’s death could now lead to an internal power struggle.

On Wednesday US officials had said they were still investigating to see whether the strike on an al-Shabaab encampment had killed Godane, 37, who reportedly trained with the Taliban in Afghanistan.

At least three strikes hit a convoy of al-Shabaab vehicles in southern Somalia on Monday night, according to witnesses and a spokesman for the group who spoke later with the Associated Press. The al-Shabaab representative said that six al-Shabaab fighters had been killed in the strikes.

The air raid came days after African Union (AU) troops and Somali government forces launched “Operation Indian Ocean”, a major offensive aimed at seizing key ports from al-Shabaab and cutting off one of their key sources of revenue: multi-million dollar exports of charcoal. AU forces were targeting Shabaab on several fronts, with Ugandan troops leading the offensives against the main port of Barawe, south of the capital, Mogadishu.

The commander of the AU in Somalia has said the death of Godane would be a “proud and happy moment for all Africa”.

Godane, who has a passion for poetry, seized world attention a year ago with the Westgate mall attack in Nairobi, which left at least 67 dead. He warned Kenya that it would suffer further atrocities unless it withdrew its troops from the AU force in Somalia.

“You cannot withstand a war of attrition inside your own country,” he said in an audio message posted on a website linked to al-Shabaab. “So withdraw all your forces, or be prepared for an abundance of blood that will be spilt in your country.”

Washington has carried out a series of drone missile strikes in the past, including attacks reportedly targeting Godane, but rarely confirms this officially.

Godane took over the leadership of al-Shabaab in 2008 after then chief Adan Hashi Ayro was killed by a US missile strike.

Also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, Godane was al-Shabaab’s spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al-Qaida. In 2012 the US offered a reward of up to $7m (£4.2m) for information leading to his arrest.",unrelated
500,Islamic State using 'SCORPION bombs' to terrorise victims,"A DESPERATE mother was tricked into feasting on cooked meat from the body of her son by Islamic State militants, it has been claimed.

The famished Kurdish mother had gone to plead with the jihadists to release her son.

Cruel militants delayed talks with the elderly mum – feeding her a meal made with the corpse of her offspring while she waited.

The depraved story was relayed by a brave Briton fighting on the front line with Kurdish forces against the Islamic State, also referred to as IS, ISIS and ISIL.

Yasir Abdulla left behind his wife and children at their Yorkshire home for six months to battle for his Kurdish homeland.

The 36-year-old said the disturbing story was the cause of his hatred against IS – and one of the reasons he has vowed to return to his war-ravaged native county and ""finish the job"".

The father-of-four told The Sun: ""I hate IS because of what happened to an old Kurdish woman from a nearby tribe.

""Her son was captured by IS fighters and taken as a prisoner to Mosul. She was determined to find her son and went to IS headquarters and asked to see him.

""The IS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

""They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were so kind.

But security guard Mr Abdulla then adds: ""They had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said, 'You've just EATEN him'.""

""They burn people alive, they chop off people's heads, there is no limit to their depravity.

""They are not Muslims, they have hijacked Islam. All they do is hate.""

The shocking account is just the latest in a string of disturbing executions and punishments administered by the immoral group.

In February, IS released a highly-choreographed propaganda film showing Jordanian fighter pilot Lieutenant Mouath al-Kasaesbeh soaked in fuel and being burned alive inside a cage.

Another video from the organisation showed a man believed to be gay thrown from a seven-storey building. The 50-year-old man, who was blindfolded throughout his sickening fall, is seen to be still alive after hitting the ground below.

He was later stoned to his death by a waiting mob.

Some have interpreted the perceived increase in brutality from the Islamic State as a sign of their weakness.

The terror organisation have suffered a number of defeats recently, including the loss of two strongholds in Iraq.

Last week, Kurdish gunmen stormed the town of Tel Hamis and fought back control from Islamic State rebels.

The group, aided by US-led coalition airstrikes, previously won back the seized border town of Kobani.

Infamous Islamic State militant Jihadi John, who is believed to have orchestrated the beheadings of dozens of hostages, was last week unmasked as a hypocritical cannabis smoker from west London.

Fearless Mr Abdulla, speaking after temporarily returning to his family home in Keighley, West Yorkshire, said: ""IS are very good at making people scared.

""If they make one person scared then that person will make another person scared and soon everyone is scared of IS.

""But the Kurds are not scared of them. Someone has to stand and fight. We have got thousands of people in many villages and towns behind us.

""If we fall then all of those places fall, and that can't happen. The Peshmerga [Military forces of Iraqi Kurdistan] can't wait to take the fight to IS.

Taylor Lianne Chandler, 41, wrote a lengthy post describing her early life, saying that at birth she had male genitalia with no testicles as well as a uterus, without ovaries. Born David Roy Fitch, she writes that she went on testosterone blockers and changed her name to Paige Victoria Whitney in her teens, then had surgery when she was in her 20s. She writes in a post she put up Nov. 13:

“By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one. In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery. …

“The problem is I have made friends that I never told and dated and married people that knew nothing of my past,” she writes. “If you don’t understand what intersex is, Google it. I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.”

According to the Intersex Society of America:

A general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male. For example, a person might be born appearing to be female on the outside, but having mostly male-typical anatomy on the inside. Or a person may be born with genitals that seem to be in-between the usual male and female types.

Chandler, who writes that she thinks her revelation may cause Phelps to terminate their relationship, claims on a Facebook page filled with photos of Phelps that she met the 29-year-old swimmer on Tinder and said their relationship was “like a teenage love affair” and that they attended a Baltimore Ravens game on their first date. Phelps has not commented on the post and spent the month of October in rehab after his DUI arrest in September. He is serving a six-month suspension by U.S. Swimming and his DUI trial in Baltimore is set for Dec. 19.

On Wednesday, she wrote: “Heard from Michael he is out of rehab and back home” and added that she is frustrated with how her story is being reported.

502,Confusion Surrounds Capture Of “ISIS Leader’s Wife”,"A homeless man was given a hundred dollars, and what he did will make you cry. YouTube channel owner Josh Paler Lin decided to see it for himself and capture it all on camera.

Normally when you think of the homeless, you probably picture some drug or alcohol addict who is only taking money from passerby to support their next fix. Some of them even make more money than the average full-time employee working legally just because they’re good actors with bad clothes and not homeless at all.

Instead of assuming the worst, Josh put his money into finding the truth. He started the video asking the audience a question and explaining his idea.

“When you give homeless people money, do you ever wonder how they spent it? Today I’m going to give a homeless guy a hundred dollars, and I’m going to follow him and see how he spent it.”

Josh approached a homeless man at an intersection holding up one of the usual cardboard signs asking for help, and begins a conversation with the man. As Josh hands the man the hundred dollars, he tears up at the generosity, telling him plainly that nobody’s ever given him that much.

Josh then left the intersection as the camera remained trained on the man. As expected, the first place he went was a liquor store, but if you watch what happens, it’s not what you’re probably thinking. Coming out with a few things in bags, he made his way to the park and started handing food and other items to the homeless people there.

After witnessing this twice, Josh approached the homeless man and told him that what he saw really touched him. He confessed that he had the man followed to see what he would do, and had his doubts initially. The man told Josh that some of the homeless are just people who fell on hard luck, and he told him his story.

To reward the man for his generosity paid forward, Josh gave him another hundred dollars.

Does this change how you think about the homeless?

503,The rats eat Prada at Vogue NY office,"Apple may be planning to hold a special event during the month of February, according to French Apple-focused website iGen [Google Translate] (via iDownloadBlog). The site's sources, which are often reliable, suggest that the event might take place during the last week of February, potentially on Tuesday, February 24.

The event may see Apple once again showcasing the Apple Watch, which is set to debut in April, and it may also see the launch of the 12-inch MacBook Air. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently predicted that the upcoming notebook will debut in March, which is in line with a late-February unveiling.

Rendering of the 12-inch MacBook Air by Martin Hajek
Apple's 12-inch MacBook Air is rumored to feature a new ultrathin design that does away with fans and introduces a revamped trackpad. It may include a low-power Core-M processor and it may be the first device to take advantage of the new reversible USB Type-C connector, which is much smaller and allows a USB cable to be inserted into a notebook in any orientation.

Apple may also use the event to unveil additional details on the Apple Watch, such as pricing and battery life. An event showing off the Apple Watch could explain why Apple has been asking some developers to have their apps ready to launch in the App Store in mid-February, as we reported last week. It's possible that Apple will use apps from these developers to demonstrate additional capabilities of the watch.

Though rumored, a February event is by no means confirmed at this point, and it is unclear what else Apple might cover in addition to the Apple Watch and the 12-inch MacBook Air.

Update 12:23 PM: Sources speaking to 9to5Mac have indicated Apple will not be holding a late February media event.

The Oscar-winning writer of Facebook movie The Social Network, Aaron Sorkin, is writing the screenplay for Britain’s Danny Boyle to direct.

Rogen’s appointment is said to be in no way a done deal, especially given that Bale has not yet signed on the dotted line. The Canadian star of This Is the End and Neighbours is best known for his work in comedic fare, and would be taking a rare step into the dramatic spotlight with the untitled biopic.

Sorkin’s take is effectively the “official” Jobs biopic, since it adapts the bestselling official biography of the technology icon, Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography. Isaacson’s book is based on more than 40 interviews with its subject conducted over two years, as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors and colleagues.A rival biopic, titled Jobs, was released in 2013 with Ashton Kutcher as the Apple founder and Josh Gad as Wozniak.

Twenty-one-year-old Dylan Thomas's horror story trip began while he was sleeping one night at his hotel: that's when a tropical spider climbed into his bed, burrowed through his appendix scar, crawled under his skin and tunneled into his sternum.

An initial visit to a doctor on Sunday saw him diagnosed as having been bitten by an insect and sent away with antihistamines.

Mr Thomas spent another day with the insect tunneling inside of him before going to a hospital.

""Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that's been living inside of me for the last 3 days, managed to get it out luckily,"" he told his Facebook friends.

The spider was eventually removed with tweezers. It was dead when pulled out.

Thomas says his friends now call him Spiderman, which is a pretty cool nickname even if you do never have another full night's sleep undisturbed by vivid nightmares again.

""I think that is fabricated, it’s nonsense,"" a spokesman in the North Korean embassy in London told Mashable.

North Korea Leadership Watch's editor Michael Madden, who is a frequent visitor to the communist state, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

""It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland,"" he said, according to the Daily Record. ""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite's thoughts. Despite voting 'no,' they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.""

In September, Choe Kwan-il, managing editor of pro-North Korea newspaper Chonson Sinbo, told The Telegraph that North Korea has quietly endorsed Scottish independence.

""I believe that every person has the right to be a member of an independent nation, to have sovereignty, to live in peace and to enjoy equality,"" Choe said. ""And I believe that a majority of Scots feel the same and will vote for independence.""

North Korea has restaurants in parts of Asia as well as one branch in Amsterdam, which are used to funnel foreign currency back into the regime's treasury. The restaurants have existed for years in parts of China, while expansion to other parts of Asia began in the early 2000s.

511,BREAKING UDPATED: ISIS REPORTEDLY USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN KOBANE,"The World Health Organization is looking into reports that ISIS fighters in Iraq have been showing up at hospitals with Ebola symptoms.

According to the pro-government Iraqi newspaper al Sabaah, an unknown number of ISIS militants have shown up at a hospital in the militant-controlled city of Mosul, about 250 miles north of Baghdad. The paper reported that foreign terrorists brought the disease into Mosul from “several countries” in Africa. (RELATED: ISIS Massacred Every Man And Boy Over 15 In Muslim Town)

It’s not yet clear whether the ISIS extremists actually have Ebola or another disease. Ebola symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea and unexplained bleeding and bruising — problems which could also be attributed to malaria or yellow fever. And doctors in Mosul might be unable to even test for Ebola.

WHO spokeswoman Christy Feig said the organization is reaching out to officials in the ISIS-held area to offer help if the disease does turn out to be Ebola. However, United Nations workers are not allowed to work in ISIS-controlled areas in either Iraq or Syria, so a UN operation to help either ISIS militants or any civilians in the areas who contract Ebola is unlikely.

Feig told Mashable that there’s been no official notification from the Iraqi government that the terrorists’ disease is, in fact, Ebola.

ISIS is against western science and medicine as a rule, but apparently several militants have taken to hospitals with Ebola-like symptoms anyway. Since taking control of Mosul in June 2014, ISIS has taken to executing doctors that refuse to treat them.

Kurdish news website Rudaw reported in Nov. 2014 that ISIS executed six doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded fighters, in addition to kidnapping six merchants for failing to pay a monthly tax to ISIS. The group reportedly executed two more doctors just last week.

The U.S. has been hitting ISIS with air strikes since mid-November and the Pentagon confirmed in December that the strikes have killed around 1,000 fighters, including three senior ISIS officials.

An Ebola outbreak, however unlikely, probably wouldn’t help matters much.

An Indian man accused of trying to rape a teenager reportedly had his penis lopped off by vigilante locals after they allegedly heard the girl’s screams.

Suresh Kumar, 40, is now recovering in hospital after he was apparently dragged into a butchers shop in the city of Ganganagar, in India’s Rajasthan state.

He had allegedly been seen pinning the petrified girl to a wall, which is when he was pulled off and taken to a store to have his genitals hacked off with a meat cleaver.

The appendage was reportedly thrown into the road, with officers now hunting down the perpetrators. He is understood to be in a critical condition, while the girl was treat for shock.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, a local, said: “No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime,” according to the Daily Mirror.

He added: “We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped.

“This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.”

The Daily Mail reports a police spokesperson as saying: “As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.

“We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.”

The Indian government has been accused of not doing enough to protect its citizens, as violent attacks against girls and women become increasingly condemned by the international community.

The girls were abducted six months ago from a school in Chibok.

Nigerian government officials claimed on Friday to have struck a two-part deal with Boko Haram, including a ceasefire and the release of 219 school girls, whose abduction last April sparked international outrage.
""Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,"" said Hassan Tukur, who represented the Nigerian government at talks with the militant organization in neighboring Chad. ""They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,"" he continued
The girls have been missing for the past six months, despite international efforts mobilized by the Twitter hashtag campaign #BringBackOurGirls to rescue them from captivity. France, Great Britain and the United States have helped with the search for the girls, while China, Israel and other nations have also provided various forms of assistance.
Nearly 300 girls were kidnapped from a boarding school in the northeastern town of Chibok on April 14, but dozens managed to subsequently escape. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has been criticized by the girls' families for responding slowly to their abduction.

Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates to ""Western education is sacrilege,"" seeks to impose a strict interpretation of Shariah law in northern Nigeria. During its early years, the Sunni militant group engaged in isolated skirmishes with Nigerian security forces. But after a bloody government crackdown in 2009, Boko Haram launched a broad insurgency. Last summer, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau declared a calipate in the areas under his forces control.
Boko Haram's insurgency has been characterized by a brutal campaign of bombings and shootings targeting Christian churches, Muslim mosques, schools, markets, bars, villages, police stations and even a UN building. An estimated 5,000 Nigerians have been killed and a further 300,000 displaced by the violence.
In 2013, the Nigerian government declared a state of emergency in the northeastern states of Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa. Amnesty International has accused the Nigerian military of war crimes, including extrajudicial killings, in its fight against Boko Haram. The United Nations and Human Rights Watch have also alleged that Nigeria's security forces have committed human rights abuses.
Nigeria's population of 177 million people is 50 percent Muslim and 40 percent Christian. Muslims are concentrated in the north and Christians in the south. The remaining 10 percent of the population practices indigenous beliefs.

The footprint cast and video were given to scientists and to a local museum, which has an exhibit on Yeti.

520,ISIS Beheads American Journalist,"At least 25 suspected Boko Haram insurgents were killed in clashes between soldiers and the Islamist militants in northeast Nigeria and five civilians were killed in fighting elsewhere in the region, a military source and residents said on Monday.

A ceasefire agreement between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government was expected to lead to the liberation of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the militants six months ago, and talks were due to continue in neighbouring Chad on Monday.

Boko Haram has not confirmed the truce and there have been at least six attacks over the weekend – blamed by security sources on the insurgents – that have killed several dozen people since the announcement of the ceasefire.

A government spokesman has said that the fighting on Sunday may be the work of criminal gangs in the lawless region.

An army officer, who requested anonymity, said the militants tried to enter the town of Damboa late on Sunday through Alagarno, a Boko Haram hideout, but soldiers fought them off. “Our men gunned down 25 of the insurgents because they would have entered Damboa and unleashed more terror on the town that is just picking up from its ruins,” the officer said.

He said an armoured vehicle and some arms were recovered from the insurgents.

Damboa, a garrison town near the border with Cameroon, has been the site of fierce fighting between the militants and Nigerian forces for months. The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive.

A member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, “Two of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.”

Separately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa.

Tada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain.

“My brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children,” he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone.

523,Apple may launch 12-inch MacBook Air with Retina Display,"BEIRUT — Islamic State group fighters seized at least one cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town, activists said Tuesday.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

The caches were airdropped early on Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobani that lies near the Turkish border. The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

On Tuesday, IS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said ""Team USA.""

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said the U.S. had seen the video but couldn't confirm its accuracy and was seeking more information.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.",unrelated
524,North Korea denies reports Kim Jong-un is to open state-backed restaurant in Scotland,"Tiger Woods' agent responded Monday to inflammatory allegations made by little-known pro Dan Olsen, who said on the Mad Dog in the Morning radio show last week that Woods is serving a suspension for a failed drug test.

""These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,"" agent Mark Steinberg said. ""They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous.""

On Monday morning, the PGA Tour responded to the claims.

""There is no truth whatsoever to these claims. We categorically deny these allegations,"" said Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour.

Woods is on leave from the PGA Tour as he tries to sort out issues with his game, especially with his chipping. Woods, who said he would not return to the Tour until he can compete with the best in the game, missed the cut in the Waste Management Phoenix Open in his first tournament of the season – shooting a career-high 82 in the process – and then withdrew with a stiff back after 11 holes the following week in the Farmers Insurance Open.

Woods said his back problems are not the reason for his hiatus from the game, nor are they related to the injuries that forced him to have back surgery last March 31.

""I've heard that he's suspended. I heard he's on a month's suspension. And it's not, it's kind of a strong witness. It's a credible person that's telling me this,"" Olsen said Friday on the radio show. ""Well, it's not testosterone, but it's something else.""

525,Islamist terrorists Jabhat Ansar al-Deen tweet picture of Texas plumber’s truck fitted with anti-aircraft gun in Syria,"North Korea may have a woman at the helm–Kim Jong-Un’s sister Kim Yo Jong–according to a rash of rumors that have popped up recently.

There’s several pieces of the news, with some indicating that the dictator Jong-Un may no longer be in control of the country.

Jang Jin-sung, formerly a key member of Kim Jong-il’s propaganda machine, said recently that a powerful group of officials that once reported only to Jong-il have stopped taking orders from Jong-Un and now effectively run the country.

The group is called the Organization and Guidance Department, and some of them want to keep the status quo while others want to open up the market.

“On one hand, it’s people who want to maintain a regime monopoly,” Jang told VICE News through a translator.

“On the other hand, it’s not like people are fighting against the regime, but in a policy sense they want to take advantage to get influence. It’s not actually consciously civil war, but there are these two incompatible forces at play.”

The insight comes as Seoul-based think tank North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity says that Kim Yo Jong may be leading the country instead of her brother.

The NKIS says that Jong-Un is getting medical treatment for an unspecified illness, and that the extended treatment was actually decided upon at a high-level meeting in early September that was held at Yo Jong’s suggestion.

She’s now charged with handling important government decisions in his absence, according to the Diplomat, citing the report.

“All the important matters related to government administration should be reported to Kim Yo-jong, so that Kim Jong-un can concentrate on getting better,” the people at the meeting decided.

Yo Jong is the daughter of Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, and his wife Kim Yong-hui, and was first spotted in public in September 2010. She was officially mentioned for the first time on March 9, 2014, being identified as a “senior official” in the government.

Then again, perhaps Yo Kong is not in total control, according to Kim Heung-gwang, the head of NKIS.

“Some say Hwang Byong-so, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,” he said.

The possible leadership change comes amid reports of an attempted coup.

526,Apple-HBO Deal Seen Launching Web-only Apple TV Streaming Service For $15 Per Month,"HBO is in talks with Apple to make Apple TV one of the launch partners for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month. HBO and streaming partner Major League Baseball Advanced Media are working to have the standalone service, called “HBO Now,” ready to launch in April in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of “Game of Thrones,” according to sources familiar with their plans.

When it launches, consumers will be able to subscribe to “HBO Now” directly from HBO for the first time, rather than through a cable, satellite or telco TV distributor such as Comcast or Verizon. The retail price is expected to be $15 a month when purchased directly from HBO, or about the that consumers pay when they order HBO through their cable, satellite or telco provider.

With “HBO Now,” HBO’s corporate parent, Time Warner Inc., is looking to a whole new generation of distributors for HBO such as Apple TV, Roku, Xbox, PlayStation, Amazon and others to help market the service to an estimated 10 million U.S. broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle. CEO Jeff Bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the 70 million cable TV subscribers who do not subscribe to HBO but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online.

HBO’s over-the-top service has been cast as the biggest chink yet in the so-called cable bundle, where consumers are required to buy packages of channels, some of which they may never watch. One study claimed the service would lead to a 7 percent drop in pay TV subscribers as users opt of cable and opt-in to HBO Now.

But some cable providers, such as Cablevision and Cox Communications, have expressed interest in bundling “HBO Now” with broadband for their own subscribers who don’t get cable TV.

Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV, sources say. Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers, but it may add a second app for HBO Now. Apple has spent the last several years negotiating for the rights to offer their own linear TV package; in the meantime, HBO Now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of Apple TV.

While HBO has not confirmed a launch date for HBO Now, internally the target is an April launch, in time for the April 12 debut of “Game of Thrones.” That’s an aggressive timeframe for Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is building the back-end along with a new front-end separate from HBO Go. HBO is taking care not to launch HBO Now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued HBO Go during last fall's debut of ""Game of Thrones.""

The launch of “HBO Now” will be a milestone for Time Warner’s premium TV channel, which has for most of its 42-year history been distributed as an add-on to a package of cable channels. The web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners, which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and, later, telcos like Verizon and AT&T.

Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from $13 to $18 a month. Most see HBO as a retention device; those that subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers. HBO and Time Warner declined to comment.

At $15 a month, HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix, which ranges from $8 to $12 a month for various levels of service, but cheaper than some were predicting. HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better, more current film library. “It’s a premium product and it will be priced accordingly,” HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February.

HBO’s push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over-the-top service that bypasses traditional cable TV. It has been met with some resistance from current distributors, such as Time Warner Cable and Comcast, two companies in the midst of a $46 billion merger, according to sources.

But HBO heard the same misgivings from cable when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors. HBO’s strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones; it’s unclear how this will go over with Apple, which has a track record of squeezing advantageous deals out of media, including the 99 cent single, more than a decade ago.

Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said in December he saw “cord-cutting” accelerate as pay-TV providers dropped subscribers. U.S. pay TV providers lost 125,000 subscribers in 2014, according to Leichtman Research Group. At the same time, HBO and Cinemax its highest number of new subscribers -- 2.8 million -- in 30 years.

Among the challenges HBO faces to get HBO Now launched is how to avoid confusion with HBO Go, the service that allows HBO’s TV subscribers to access it on the web, smartphones and tablets. The two services will have separate log-in pages and separate apps, but some cable execs are concerned about customer confusion. The explanation might challenge even the best call center employee: HBO Go is for TV subscribers to watch their content on devices; HBO Now for those who don’t subscribe via TV.

527,Breaking: Soldier shot at National War Memorial in Ottawa,"A gunman opened fire at Canada's National War Memorial on Wednesday, killing one soldier, Ottawa police said in a statement.

Witnesses in the Canadian capital, Ottawa, say the gunman then ran into the main Parliament building, where dozens of shots were fired.

Ottawa Police say ""a male suspect has been confirmed deceased."" It's unclear whether that suspect was killed at the Parliament building.

During a press conference, Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said this is still an ""ongoing investigation"" and asked ""people to stay away from [Ottawa's] downtown core.""

Bordeleau was asked if police are still looking for another suspect, but he would only say that authorities are sweeping Parliament Hill to make sure it is safe.

This hour, Parliament remains locked down.

This is a breaking news story. We'll update once we know more. And as we always tell you when stories like this are developing, information may come in that later turns out to have been incorrect. We'll do our best to sort through what's out there and reliable and update as needed.

Update at 2:02 p.m. ET. Soldier, Shooter Killed:

In a press release, Ottawa police say today's incident happened near the National War Memorial and on Parliament Hill only.

Earlier, there were reports that shots were fired near Rideau Centre Mall.

According to Ottawa Police, the shooting started at the National War Memorial, where one soldier was killed. There was another shooting incident at Parliament and police say one male suspect was deceased.

It's not clear whether he was killed while trading fire with police at the Parliament building.

Update at 1:56 p.m. ET. Soldier Killed, Ottawa Police Say:

On its Twitter feed, Ottawa police say one victim — a member of the Canadian forces — was killed in the incident.

Update at 1:44 p.m. ET. Briefing Upcoming:

We'll know much more at 2 p.m. ET., when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police brief reporters.

CP24 is live streaming its coverage and so is the CBC.

Update at 1:34 p.m. ET. U.S. In Close Touch:

During his regularly scheduled press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Obama has been briefed on the matter in Ottawa and will at some point talk to Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

Earnest said Canada is one of the United States' ""closest friends and allies,"" and administration officials have been in touch to offer any support.

Earnest was asked if this was a terrorist attack, and he said he was not in ""a position to render judgement on that at this point.""

Update at 1:33 p.m. ET. Multiple Shots Heard:

CNN interviewed Peter Henderson, who said he was locking his bicycle near the memorial when the initial shooting took place.

""I heard four shots, turned around and saw the soldier laying on the ground,"" Henderson said.

""People fled Parliament by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, witnesses told the Canadian Press news agency,"" The Associated Press relays.

The CBC reports that ""Ottawa Civic Hospital confirmed two people have been taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, one with a gunshot wound."" Reuters quotes Canadian television as saying that Prime Minister Stephen Harper is safe.

The National War Memorial is located in the heart of the Canadian capital near the Parliament buildings.

CBC says:

Josh Wingrove, a reporter on Parliament Hill with The Globe and Mail, tweets:

The incident comes after the country raised its terror threat level from low to medium and two days after two Canadian soldiers were run down — one of them killed — in Quebec by a man who reportedly had jihadist sympathies.

528,"Whoa, Paul Rudd Was One of the Airport Heroes Who Took Down the Homophobe","In 2015, there’s the quality-fake news and the crappy-fake news.

Examples? Of course.

The quality: Fake news source The Onion quoted fake people on a very real, if unbelievable, subject on March 3, 2015: As the Utah Senate weighed legal medical marijuana last week, a DEA agent testified that he came across “rabbits that had cultivated a taste for the marijuana” while eradicating illegal pot farms in the wild back-country. It’s hard to believe, a drug enforcement agent’s encounter with stoned rabbits, but that part’s real. The fake part: The Onion quoted fake people’s reactions to the all-too-real news. “Rabbits are going to be getting high anyway,” one hilariously fake person said. “Better that it be safe, legal, and regulated.”

The crappy: Fake news site The Daily Currant wrote a story under the headline “Marijuana Overdoses Kill 37 in Colorado On First Day of Legalization” on Jan. 2, 2014. It began ridiculously: “Colorado is reconsidering its decision to legalize recreational pot following the deaths of dozens due to marijuana overdoses.” How anyone could believe such a story, from such an outlet, is still dumbfounding.

And now some more fake news is on the loose — and it falls on the crappy, lowest-common-denominator side. The Racket Report already has hundreds of thousands of shares on its recent piece, “KFC Gets Occupational Business License To Sell Marijuana In Colorado Restaurants.”

Nevermind the story and its preposterous hypothetical for just one moment — what about the scrolling “News Ticker” above the headline pitching other “news” including “Exclusive Photos Of Miley Cyrus And Justin Bieber’s Wedding!” and “69 People Die After Drinking Bad Coors Lite At A Funeral.” Neither of those headlines threw off the 200,000-plus people sharing this story to their own social media?

The Racket Report’s piece said KFC “decided to incorporate a marijuana dispensary with their Colorado franchise restaurants. Franchisees have the opportunity to expand into the business for an additional $35,000 setup fee. The KFC Corporation was approved on February 3, 2015 for their Marijuana Retail Recreational Pot / Medical Marijuana Occupational Business License. Currently, 42 of the nearly 100 KFC franchises in the state of Colorado have added this ‘option’ to their menu.”

Sounds believable, right?

Wrong. As I wrote a year ago as the “Marijuana Overdoses Kill 37″ story was going viral:

We’re all too discerning to believe everything we read online. But you read this and didn’t check (the site’s) About page or proven, local-to-Colorado news sources before Facebooking it. Next time you see a major piece of news being reported by an unrecognized entity, you might think to question its content before spreading it as fact.

The Racket Report’s About page says “some stories on this website are fictitious.” Gee, really?

The beauty of the weed-at-KFC ridiculousness comes in the news that there is a KFC selling marijuana in California — though it’s a Kind For Cures medical dispensary and not a Kentucky Fried Chicken fast-food restaurant, as Inquisitr reported.

531,"Google to buy big chunk of Pacific Shores, iconic Redwood City office park","Doctor in besieged Syrian town reports arrival of patients with blisters, burning eyes and breathing difficulties after explosion

Kurds battling Islamic State militants for control of Kobani fear the extremist group may have used an unidentified chemical weapon, according to officials and one of the few doctors still working in the besieged Syrian town.

Patients with blisters, burning eyes and breathing difficulties turned up at a clinic after a blast was heard on Tuesday evening, Dr Walat Omar said. He described the symptoms as abnormal and said he could not identify their cause, but suspected a chemical weapon.

“After a loud explosion [on Tuesday night], we received some patients with abnormal symptoms. They reported a bad smell which produced some kind of allergic reaction,” Omar said in a telephone interview that was periodically disrupted by heavy explosions.

“Some had red patches and blisters on their skins, others had difficulties breathing and others were vomiting, with painful throats, and others with burning eyes and noses. There was one patient, all his body was covered in red patches and blisters.”

Islamic State (Isis) is thought to have obtained stocks of ageing but still potent chemical weapons when it seized Iraqi army bases where they were stored, the New York Times reported earlier this month.

In June, the group took control of a sprawling complex that had been the heart of Saddam Hussein’s chemical weapons programme, Al-Muthanna State Establishment. There may also have been chemical weapons buried or abandoned elsewhere, that were not destroyed by US forces or the Iraqi military.

Stocks manufactured before 1991 are dirty, corroded and not always easy to identify or use, but can still cause serious injury.

Iraqi officials said 11 police officers were poisoned by chlorine gas last month, when Isis fighters used it to attack the Iraqi town of Duluiya. All the officers survived.

That attack was hundreds of miles from Kobani, near the Syrian border, where Omar said he feared eight civilians had been injured by some kind of chemical attack.

Intense fighting has made it impossible to get doctors the equipment they need to do definitive tests for the use of chemical weapons, but Omar said they displayed symptoms distinct from anything else he had treated in weeks of heavy battles.

He said he had ruled out chlorine gas or biological weapons, based on his medical training, but thought the injuries were caused by a chemical. Trained in Ukraine, he is originally from Kobani and returned there to work after seven years at medical school.

“This is the first time we have seen this kind of condition,” Omar said. “I have seen other strange conditions but nothing like this before.”

The opinions of chemical weapons experts consulted by the Guardian were divided after seening a series of pictures provided by Omar of a young man with large skin blisters and a severely swollen lip.

The pictures did not have any metadata to confirm the time and place they were taken, but had not been published on the internet before Omar provided them to a Kurdish journalist.

One expert with personal experience of treating mustard gas victims said that, although the blisters were not typical, the symptoms overall were consistent with a possible sulphur mustard poisoning. That could only be confirmed with a urine or blood test.

Other experts said that while the symptoms could be consistent with exposure to a chemical agent, they were somewhat unusual and other medical conditions, such as a severe allergic reaction, would need to be ruled out.

Senior Kurdish politicians said they feared a chemical attack, and had asked for testing kits to seek confirmation.

“Many people were injured … and showed symptoms of chemical weapons use: choking, breathing difficulties, bleeding eyes, burning skin etc,” said Idris Nassan, deputy foreign minister of the Kobani administration. “Some of the doctors say that it might be phosphorus or poison gas of some kind, but the investigation is ongoing, we don’t know for sure.”

It is possible that Isis fighters could mistake some chemical munitions for ordinary weapons and use them without being aware of what they are handling. It could also be harder to evaluate the impact of attacks using partially degraded weapons, one expert said.

“Various factors might contribute to far milder symptoms than those normally associated with mustard agent exposure under combat conditions. These could include impure or degraded agent, short-term exposure, or exposure to a limited volume of agent,” said Jean-Pascal Zanders, a former analyst with the chemical and biological warfare project at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

The bomb believed to have caused the injuries treated by Omar exploded at about 10pm in west Kobani, near a hospital. Omar said he thought Isis may have targeted the medical centre to try to undermine morale, although it was not being used and none of the forces defending the city were in the area.

“Some fighters were further away, they complained about their eyes watering and burning, and pain in their nose,” he said, estimating that around 20 of them were affected but needed only basic first aid.

Regarding civilians who were closer to the blast, Omar said he was treating affected patients with oxygen, the steroid cortisone and other drugs until about 2.30am, as well as fielding calls from people who did not want to leave their homes.

The three most seriously injured patients, who ranged in age from 17 to over 40, stayed in the clinic overnight for observation and Omar was trying to arrange for their evacuation to Turkey for further treatment.

One Kurdish activist said Kobani may have been hit by teargas for the first time, perhaps drifting across from a Turkish border village where police had been using it for weeks to break up crowds of demonstrators. It has not been deployed in the intense battles for Kobani and so would not be recognised by residents, although demonstrations nearest to the border have almost all been in daylight hours, while Omar reported victims arriving well after nightfall.

532,NASA Raises Doubts About Reports of Nicaraguan Meteorite,"(Reuters) - A mysterious late-night blast in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua that left a crater 12 meters (40 feet) wide was most likely caused by a meteorite, government scientists said on Sunday.

The loud explosion occurred around 11 p.m. on Saturday on the outskirts of Managua near the airport, said Wilfried Strauch from the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter) in an interview on a government TV channel. No one was injured.

Strauch said that Nicaragua is asking the United States for expert help to investigate the event, which was picked up by seismic sensors.

""All the evidence that we've confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event,"" said Jose Millan, also from Ineter.

""Firstly, we have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact.""

Strauch said they had not been able to determine the composition of the supposed meteorite as they were not sure whether it had disintegrated on hitting ground or if it remained buried.

""We need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population,"" Millan said.

Nicaragua has more than 20 volcanoes and is regularly shaken by earthquakes, so many locals initially thought a quake caused the loud bang.

He did it again. Rapper Kanye West reprised his most infamous stunt at Sunday night's Grammy awards, taking the stage as Beck was accepting the album of the year award.

After this latest incident, organizers of the major awards shows like the Grammys, MTV Video Music Awards, People's Choice Awards and the Oscars have unanimously agreed to disinvite and bar West from their respective ceremonies. The television networks that air these awards programs also joined in the 'West boycott.'

While it is true that West created a stir at the 2015 Grammy Awards when he briefly interrupted Beck during the musician's acceptance speech (just as he had done to Taylor Swift in 2009), Kanye has not been banned from all future award shows.

This comes after a Kansas City apartment building in the 3600 block of E. Meyer Blvd. was sealed off about 9:30 p.m. Saturday when the man who lived there became seriously ill.

Paramedics rushed the man to Research Medical Center Brookside Campus about 9:30 p.m. It was then when all or part of the medical facility was quarantined, a source close to the situation told KCTV5 News.

""Like hospitals across the United States, Research Medical Center has standard infectious disease precautions and we are well-equipped and well-prepared to implement them as necessary,"" Hamele said. ""As healthcare providers, our job is to care for sick patients and we will continue to provide high-quality care to our community as we always have.""

538,Lynch mob chop man's penis off after catching him allegedly trying to rape teenager,"A man had his penis cut off by an angry mob for attempting to rape a teenager in Ganganagar, Rajasthan. The incident took place after shocked members of the public saw the man in an alley, pinning a terrified girl to a wall.

  
(Representational Image).Reuters
The 40-year-old man, recognised as Suresh Kumar, soon found himself being dragged away by the hysteric mob while they decided to punish him in their own way, the Daily Star reported posting pictures of the incident and a severed penis thrown on the street.
The mob took the man to a local butcher shop, where he was beaten with sticks for more than an hour. Thereafter, they hacked his penis off with a meat cleaver and dumped the severed organ in the middle of the street. The man -- bloodied, bruised and unconscious -- was abandoned with no one willing to show any mercy, the Daily Mirror reports.
The Daily Star online, which first reported the story with a censored photograph of the cut penis, claims that its reporters have seen the picture but could not show it due to its graphic nature.
""No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime,"" the tabloid quoted a local man Aamir Dhawan as saying.
""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hanged, and molested, and it's time it stopped,"" he said adding that the incident sent out a strong message to people with perverted mindset.
The police have condemned the attack, warning locals not to take law into their hands and telling those people who cut the man's penis to hand themselves in.?

Sorry to rain on the rumor mill's parade, but RoboCop-style robots are not patrolling Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus.

The rumor took shape after California-based Knightscope showed off its K5 security robot at an event hosted at Microsoft, according to Knightscope co-founder and Vice President Stacy Stephens.

""So people started snapping photos,"" and all the sudden a number of news outlets were reporting the robots had been deployed at Microsoft's offices in Mountain View, Calif., Stephens said.

The 5-feet, 300-pound K5 looks like R2-D2 from Star Wars. They roam around with a slew of sensors, looking for trouble, sounding alarms and alerting live security guards.

Knighscope has built the security-guard-mimicking robot and it is trying out the technology with an undisclosed number of partners – but Microsoft is not one of those testers.

""Obviously we're right across the street so we would love them to be [a customer],"" Stephens said. ""But we have not deployed there.""

Stephens said he got a phone call from Microsoft this morning after the news broke.

""They said, 'Hey, this is really cool. We didn't know we were doing this.' I said, 'You're not,'"" Stephens said.

""Unfortunately, that's what people get for not calling us up to confirm things,"" he added.

540,Oscar winner Christian Bale to play Steve Jobs in upcoming biopic,"British actor poised to take the lead in Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle, after Leonardo DiCaprio pulled out

Christian Bale is back in line to play Steve Jobs in a new biopic about the Apple co-founder after Leonardo DiCaprio backed out in order to take a break from acting.

The film industry magazine Variety reports that Bale will take the lead in the film Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin, scriptwriter of The Social Network and The West Wing.

Based on Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs: the Exclusive Biography, the film will be divided into three long scenes taking place in real time, each set on the eve of a product launch. Sorkin has revealed that the products are the Mac in 1984; the NeXT computer Jobs launched in 1990 after leaving Apple; and the iPod, which launched 2001.

David Fincher had originally been announced as the film’s director, but left the project after an argument with Sony about his salary and the marketing of the film. Bale had been Fincher’s first choice to play Jobs.

Bale and Boyle are set to shoot the film in spring 2015. Sorkin said that writing a film about Jobs “is a little like writing about the Beatles. There are so many people out there that know him and revere him.”",agree

Here’s the disclaimer for the site: “Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.”

It had more than 80,000 shares as of Wednesday.

“And Brad Pitt is a bad choice to play John Teller anyway , I’d Choose Sam Elliot,” one person wrote in the comments section.

Added another: “Hope this is fake. Not sure I like Brad Pitt as John Teller. I don’t want to look at the screen and feel it’s another Hollywood movie. Should get lost in the story just like on TV and may not happen when seeing Brad Pitt. Should get a little known actor for the role to create the character rather than buy one.”

Here’s what the original article said:

Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture.

Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. “People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film” Sutter said.

Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt.",unrelated
542,Ottawa shooting: Slain soldier named as Nathan Cirillo while suspect identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau,"Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24, was shot in the chest by a masked gunman, who then rode off in a car

The solider killed today by a masked gunman as he stood guard at the National War Memorial in Ottawa, Canada, has been named locally as Corporal Nathan Cirillo, while a deceased suspect has been identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau.

Cirillo, 24, a reservist with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders within the Canadian Armed Forces, was shot in the chest by the assailant. He was put in an ambulance but latter “succumbed to his injuries”, Ottawa Police said.

The shooter then jumped into a car and sped off, though whether this gunman was behind the shoot-out at the Canadian Parliament minutes later is still unconfirmed. An assailant who entered Parliament was shot dead by sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers.

A Canadian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the dead suspect is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, Associated Press reports, but could not give more details on a possible motive nor details of his background.

However, local reports say that Zehaf-Bibeau was Canadian-born, while Reuters have reported that he was a convert to Islam and was from Quebec.

Earlier today at a press conference following the dramatic incident in Canada’s capital city of Ottawa, Mayor Jim Watson said: “I urge all of my fellow residents to think of the individual standing on guard this morning at the National War Memorial.

“Remember how that one person's life has been taken from us - from family, from friends, from the future that was to be his.”

As reported by CBC News, Cirillo was just one of the guards on duty, who make up of a larger roster of soldiers that rotate on an hourly or bi-hourly basis. They also carry unloaded rifles.

Officials also said that the incident ""caught us surprise"", despite the government upgrading its terror threat from low to medium a day prior due to ""general chatter"" online from jihadist groups including Isis.

An Facebook group in memory of Cirillo has already had over 10,000 followers, with friends and acquaintances of the solider reportedly emailing in their memories of him.

A comment on his profile picture on Facebook reads: “RIP Nathan! Thank you for defending our country, your son is so proud of you. I miss you.”

Student soldiers within the Armed Forces have also reportedly been told not to wear their uniforms, including when on base or inside their cars.

Last week a 24-year-old Muslim convert admitted taking her infant son to live among Islamic State terrorists in the Syrian city of Raqqa because she believes he will lead a 'better life' under their brutal regime.

Asiya Ummi Abdullah denied that children are unhappy living under the oppressive rule of ISIS' religious fanatics and explained that she felt her three-year-old son's spiritual well-being was better served in the group's de facto capital, where public crucifixions and beheadings are commonplace.

Ummi Abduallah - who had lived in Turkey since her teens but was born in Kyrgyzstan - said moving to the militant stronghold in Syria was in part to shield the young boy from the sex, crime, drugs and alcohol she sees as rampant in her home town Istanbul.

Islamic State militants are now in control of one third of the besieged Syrian city of Kobane despite three days of American airstrikes, a group monitoring violence in the country said today.

This morning the chilling sight of the group's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes.

While the airstrikes appear to have slowed the militants advance in some areas of the city, ISIS fighters appear to be creeping ever closer to the centre of Kobane, where thousands of civilians unable or unwilling to flee their homes face rape and massacre.

News of ISIS' gains came as the Pentagon admitted airstrikes alone will not be enough to prevent the fall of Kobane, raising serious questions over the U.S.'s wider campaign against the terror group.

547,"Reports: Jihadists Steal Commercial Jets, Raise 9/11 Fears","Eleven commercial jets have reportedly been stolen in recent weeks in Libya, and Western intelligence agencies have begun warning they could be used in terror attacks on Sept. 11, the anniversary of the devastating Osama bin Laden-orchestrated attacks on New York and Washington that left nearly 3,000 dead.
According to a report in the Free Beacon, the jets were taken by Islamist militias in Libya, and reports distributed within the U.S. government “included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack … on the date marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks …”

One official in the report assembled by the highly respected Bill Gertz said, “There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

Gertz now is senior editor of the Free Beacon, but he built his career during 27 years as reporter, editor and columnist with the Washington Times. He’s also authored six books and his online biography reveals the state-run Xinhua news agency in 2006 identified him as the No. 1 “anti-China expert” in the world.

His report about the missing jetliners notes authorities have a high level of concern because of the convergence of the cases of missing airplanes and the 13th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.

It also is just two years after the Sept. 11 terror attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, a scandal that still is reverberating through the Obama administration and threatening to become a game-changer for the 2014 elections.

Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in that attack.

What do YOU think? Do you fear for America’s safety? Sound off in today’s WND poll.

A State Department official declined comment, Gertz reported.

The officials quoted by Gertz said U.S. intelligence agencies now are trying to locate all the airplanes belonging to two Libyan airline companies, and they have not confirmed the aircraft theft, which reportedly happened after the takeover by terrorists of Tripoli International Airport in August.

“The state-owned Libyan Airlines fleet until this summer included 14 passenger and cargo jetliners, including seven Airbus 320s, one Airbus 330, two French ATR-42 turboprop aircraft, and four Bombardier CJR-900s,” the report said. “Libyan state-owned Afriqiyah Airways fleet is made up of 13 aircraft, including three Airbus 319s, seven Airbus 320s, two Airbus 330s, and one Airbus 340.”

The report blames Libyan Dawn, one of the terror organizations operating there, for the alleged thefts in late August.

Following the warnings from Western intelligence agencies, Tunisia halted flights from Tripoli, Sirte and Misrata because of the potential the jets would appear in suicide missions, the report said.

And Egypt halted flights to and from Libya.

Gertz said military components from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt were put on a higher level of alert.

Libya has been an uncontrolled disaster area since the Obama administration engineered the removal in 2011 of strongman Muammar Gadhafi from office. His departure left terror factions struggling for control as the nation plunged into chaos.

Both Libyan Dawn and another group called Ansar al-Shariah were declared by Libya’s parliament to be terror groups. The report said Ansar al-Shariah reportedly has surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft guns and rocket-propelled grenades, among other weapons.

Abderrahmane Mekkaoui, a Moroccan military expert, explained to Al Jazeera broadcasting that “credible intelligence” reports say the jets are intended for use by a group called Masked Men Brigade for attacks on the 9/11 date.

Gertz reported that a counterterrorism expert, Sebastian Gorka, explained the events that could develop with the stolen jets.

“The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept. 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,” he said.

“The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,” he said.

Gertz’s report noted the planes themselves become an agent of destruction.

“Who needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes?” asked Michael Rubin, of the American Enterprise Institute. “Even empty, but loaded up with fuel, they can be as devastating.”",discuss
548,New York City Plans to End Arrests for Possession of Small Amounts of Marijuana,"Jeny Chang for BuzzFeed / Via Drug Policy Alliance data

NEW YORK CITY — The New York Police Department will no longer arrest people for low-level marijuana possession, according to people with knowledge of the city’s drug strategy who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The NYPD will issue violation summonses to people caught with marijuana — instead of putting them in handcuffs and taking them to a precinct. The summonses will require people to appear in court at a later date and pay a fine.

Few details on the new policy were immediately available, but an official with one of the city’s five district attorneys offices confirmed to BuzzFeed News on Monday that the change “is happening.” The official added that “burning marijuana” would still be cause for arrest, but that having the drug in a public place would not.

The NYPD and Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but are expected to officially announce the new policy at a news conference on Monday.

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance​ ​said​ Monday​ he supported the change two years ago and still does. “This policy – by diverting thousands of cases from criminal court – will also keep low-level offenders, particularly teens, from an arrest and all its attendant consequences, including a night or more in jail,” he said.

The new policy, which was first reported by the New York Times, would bring about a sea change in the way the city is policed. Misdemeanor-level marijuana possession accounts for a large percentage of the city’s arrests, a vast majority of which happen to young black or Latino men living in poor neighborhoods.

Some public defenders praised the policy.

“This is a huge improvement,” Lisa Schreibersdorf, executive director of Brooklyn Defender Services, told BuzzFeed News. “Summonses don’t get you fingerprinted. This will be better for people who are vulnerable to collateral consequences, like immigrants.”

Still, Schreibersdorf cautioned that the policy will not fulfill its goal unless the NYPD relaxes its identification requirements for summonses. Immigrants and teenagers often do not carry valid identification, she said, which often means that they cannot be processed for a summons. She added that the policy does not address the root cause of the problem — namely, that police officers in New York routinely stop people without probable cause.

“Having summonses is an improvement for people who are already being stopped, but that doesn’t mean they should be stopped in the first place,” she said. “The problem, from my perspective, is that stopping people without cause is unconstitutional.”

Advocates also warned that the new policy could result in an increased number of arrest warrants, which are issued to people who fail to show to court for a summons. As the New York Times reported, up to a quarter of people issued summons fail to appear for their court appointments. As a consequence, there are currently 1.2 million open bench warrants in New York City — about one per every eight residents.

Possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana has not been a crime in New York State since 1977. The NYPD made 59,000 arrests for misdemeanor possession in 2010.

Under current law, the only way to get arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for having less than 25 grams of marijuana is to display it “in public view.” The legal definition of that term, however, is ambiguous. “Public view” can mean smoking pot in a public place, but it can also mean that a police officer stopped you, frisked you, and pulled a small bag of marijuana from your pocket.

When the bag leaves your pocket, it has technically entered public view, and the officer can legally arrest you and charge you with a misdemeanor — even though you had less than the decriminalized amount. This broad interpretation of “public view” helped low-level marijuana possession become one of the NYPD’s most commonly used arrest charges during stop-and-frisks.

The correlation between marijuana arrests and stop-and-frisk became apparent after 2011, when a U.S. District Court declared the policing tactic an unconstitutional form of racial profiling. By 2013, the NYPD was making only 28,000 marijuana possession arrests — still a large number, but 47% less than in 2010.

A recent study by the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance found that upwards of 86% of all low-level marijuana arrests made in 2014 affected black people or Latinos — even though national studies have shown that white people are just as likely to smoke marijuana regularly, and slightly more likely to have tried it.

The report also found that the geography of the arrests is highly segregated, with dominantly white neighborhoods seeing fewer arrests than neighborhoods of color with similar per-capita incomes.

These stark race and class disparities in drug law enforcement became a sore point for Mayor de Blasio, who as a candidate promised to end discriminatory policing. They also drove Ken Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney, to announce in July that his office would no longer prosecute low-level marijuana possession, opting instead to dismiss most of such cases.

Still, the NYPD defended the high number of arrests, with Willam Bratton, de Blasio’s police commissioner, saying that Thompson’s decision would not affect the NYPD’s approach to marijuana possession. The policy to be announced on Monday will mark the first time the current administration will take concerted action to address the disparities in marijuana arrests.

In an interview with the New York Times, Thompson said he was worried that the new policy could harm those it was intended to help by removing prosecutors from the picture. This is because a prosecutor can opt to dismiss a misdemeanor, but cannot do the same for a violation.

But as new report by the Vera Institute shows, prosecutorial review can cut both ways. The Institute analyzed data provided by the Manhattan District Attorney and found that black people and Latinos were “much more likely to receive a sentence offer including a jail of prison term” than white defendants in similar circumstances.

In the case of misdemeanor marijuana possession, the Vera report found, black people arraigned in Manhattan were 19% more likely to receive jail or prison time than people from all other ethnicities. By contrast, defendants arrested in Brooklyn could expect their cases to be dismissed. The new policy is expected to standardize procedures across the city.

More details on the new policy are expected soon. De Blasio and Bratton are scheduled to make an announcement together Monday at 3 p.m.

549,Kim Jong-Un 'bans the name Kim Jong-un',"North Korean despot Kim Jong-un has been guzzling pint after pint of ‘snake wine’, with the body of a dead cobra in the bottle – in a vain attempt to restore life to genitals he may not have seen for years due to his vast bulk.

Locals believe that the meaty brew increases the size of a man’s manhood – and improves chances of pregnancy.

Kim has piled on enormous amounts of weight after bingeing on Emmenthal cheese and Johnnie Walker whisky, and the 31-year-old is struggling to father a child with his lucky young wife, Ri Joi-Su, 22.

Kim believes that glugging litres of wine, mixed with rotting flesh and venom could be just the ticket to restore his virility and father a sibling for daughter Ju-ae, two.

One South Korean ex-pat said, ‘The elite in the country joke that he is too big to please his wife and that’s why they do not have any other children.’

‘One senior official said that Kim was drinking many bottles of snake wine to help him in the bedroom department.’

Jong-un was first exposed to Emmenthal while studying in Switzerland as a young man, and his fondness for the cheese is said to have rapidly escalated into dependence.

His ballooning weight is thought to be a result of daily binges on the cheese, which is used in fondues, gratins, raclettes and sandwiches.

Repeat: A Hoax.","TOKYO — Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumors covering every possibility from a stroke to a coup d’etat, is merely recovering from ankle surgery, a South Korean newspaper has reported.

Kim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.

“I heard that Kim Jong Un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,” the source was quoted as saying, adding that he had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.

Such is the fascination with North Korea, the world’s most impenetrable country, that rumors spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.

Nevertheless, it is true that Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, causing speculation about his health. But the gossip mill started up again last week when Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since Sept. 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. It went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the “Great Successor,” as he is known, was in an “indisposed condition.”

“Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,” said the narrator of a documentary called “Improving the Lives of the People,” showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month. It aired just before the session of the assembly, North Korea’s quasi-parliament, was broadcast, the Daily NK Web site reported.

With Kim shown carting around heavy things, the narrator continued: “His whole body is drenched in sweat, but he does not stop working hard, instead showing concern for the health of the other workers.”

Separately, the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Workers’ Party, recently reported that Kim had “labored on,” visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather.

Outside commentators have guessed that Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.

Weibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China’s official papers, ran a commentary Monday titled “For those who make up rumors of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?”

“Netizens who have a radical opinion can’t represent the opinion of China and China’s attitude toward North Korea was not changed,” the paper said.

In Washington, U.S. officials said they had no information about North Korea’s leader. “I can just say that I have no confirmation of the reports,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. “We’ve seen them, but we don’t have any confirmation.”

In Beijing, a U.S. diplomat said Monday that North Korea has rejected U.S. efforts to discuss the detention of three Americans, Reuters reported. Glyn Davies, U.S. special representative for North Korean policy, who is visiting the region, said Pyongyang’s refusal to discuss the issue was a sign that it “doesn’t have an interest in coming back into the international system as a responsible country.”",unrelated
552,Meet the X-BOY: Electric shock turns kid into MAGNETO,"A schoolboy almost killed by an electric shock from a street lamp now claims he has ‘magnetic superpowers’ like Magneto from X-Men.

Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, 12, had been walking home after school when he lent briefly against the lamppost that was live from a faulty wire, and was blasted across the pavement.

He says that since the accident he has been able to attract metal objects like coins and spoons towards his body, just like the famous Marvel villain.

Nikolai said: 'When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened. When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.'

He said he was a keen fan of comics and, believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto, had decided to put it to the test.

He said: 'I can do things I couldn't do before but I don't have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things.’

Nikolai says he has now decided to become a superhero rather than a fireman when he is older, as he wants to do something that helps people (clearly fireman wasn’t helping people enough).

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers.

Stories about 'living magnets' began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century. In 2004, the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Although people who have the ability to attract metal items are commonly referred to as 'magnets,' many of them can also hold plastic, glass, wood and paper items on their body.

Only some of them develop a 'preference' for a particular material. In 1990, as many as 300 'living magnets' gathered for a conference in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV. The woman could hold 7 kilos of metal on a vertical palm.

Scientists say however that rather than people being magnetic, it is probably nothing more than unusually sticky skin.",discuss
553,iOS 8 bug reportedly erases iCloud Drive documents when settings are reset,"Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has a plan to boost the readership of The Washington Post, which he bought last year for $250 million.

Amazon's newest line of high-end Kindle Fire HDX tablets will come pre-installed with an app curating Post news and photography, Brad Stone reports for Bloomberg.

The app will be free, at least at first, and will also be available to download on other devices, though with a monthly subscription fee.

The effort is reportedly called ""Project Rainbow"" internally, and marks Bezos' first move to create ties between the newspaper and Amazon.

The initiative is being led by the former editor in chief of Salon, Kerry Lauerman, who was one of many new hires brought on since Bezos took charge.

As Stone points out, this move would not only get the Post to more readers, but also potentially make the Kindle Fire HDX tablet more attractive to buyers. Amazon has made a huge bet on original content, like television shows and video games, to add value to its devices through its subscription service, Amazon Prime, and adding Washington Post's news could align with those efforts.

Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

554,Priest who died for 48 minutes says he met God and she’s a woman,"A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart has revealed a shocking revelation that will change everything you once believed.

The 71-year-old cleric Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

Father John Micheal O’neal was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival.

With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 minutes later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.

Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.

“I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric. “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however, if they will allow Father O’neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.",agree

556,'Hairgate': iPhone hit by new social media storm,"While local reports revealed Wednesday that the Jordanian King Abdullah will authorize airstrikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group, a U.S. official described the Arab monarch as citing a Hollywood movie character when expressing his wrath upon hearing that the militants had burned his countryman pilot alive during his captivity.

“He mentioned ‘Unforgiven’ and he mentioned Clint Eastwood, and he actually quoted a part of the movie,” Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., a Marine Corps veteran of two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, who was in the meeting with the king, told Fox News Channel in an interview aired Wednesday.

King Abdullah had to cut his U.S. trip short after hearing the news that Moaz al-Kasasbeh was burned alive.

During a private session with members of the House Armed Services Committee lawmakers, the king expressed his anger by citing American movie icon Clint Eastwood.

“He said there is going to be retribution like ISIS hasn’t seen,” said the Marine Corps veteran.

However, Hunter would not say which part of “Unforgiven” the king quoted, but noted it was where Eastwood’s character describes how he is going to deliver his retribution.

“He’s angry,” Hunter said of King Abdullah. “They’re starting more sorties tomorrow than they’ve ever had. They’re starting tomorrow. And he said, ‘The only problem we’re going to have is running out of fuel and bullets.’”

“He’s ready to get it on,” Hunter added. “He really is. It reminded me of how we were after 9/11. We were ready to give it to them.”

Hunter also said that the lawmakers and King Abdullah did not make any mention of U.S. President Barack Obama. 
He added: “ISIS is now going to regret this … because King Abdullah is not Barack Obama.”

The Jordan Times reported that thousands of Jordanians gathered on Wednesday to receive King Abdullah.

The Jordan times also reported that mosques and churches around the Kingdom held prayers on Wednesday in memory of al-Kasasbeh.

King not flying missions
Meanwhile, a Jordanian government official on Thursday told Al Arabiya News that King Abdullah was not flying missions against ISIS himself, after local media reports – also taken by some international outlets - indicated he is set to do so.

The official also noted that observers should refrain from calling King Abdullah a fighter pilot as he does not officially hold the title. He is, however, the commander-in-chief of the Jordanian Air Force.

The king is a trained combatant, part of the parachute brigade and flies civilian planes and helicopters, the official added.

557,Mexico Says Students Not Among Dead in Mass Grave,"Security forces investigating the role of municipal police in clashes in this southern city a week ago found a mass grave on the edge of town, raising fears the pits might hold 43 students missing since the violence that also resulted in six shooting deaths.

Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre said the victims had been “savagely slaughtered.”

Jesus Lopez, the father of one of the missing students, told The Associated Press that a delegation of family and school representatives would come to Iguala on Sunday to get information about developments in the case from authorities.

“We cannot say anything. We are very nervous, but until they inform us, there is nothing,” said Lopez, whose 19-year-old son, Giovani, hasn’t been seen since the violence last weekend.

Separately, a group of students and relatives of the missing young people said they planned to march Sunday from Aytozinapa Normal school to the state capital of Chilpancingo to demand information in the case.

Anger over the discovery of the graves exploded Saturday night when a group of young people from the school protested outside the governor’s Chilpancingo residence. They threw Molotov cocktails and overturned a car after state authorities told them they would not allow them to travel to the graves to determine if the bodies are those of their missing classmates.

Guerrero State Prosecutor Inaky Blanco did not say Saturday night how many bodies were in the burial pits uncovered on a hillside on Iguala’s outskirts, and he declined to speculate about whether the dead were the missing students.

“It would be irresponsible” to jump to conclusions before tests to identify the bodies, Blanco said. Officials said the federal Attorney General’s Office and the National Human Rights Commission had sent teams of experts to aid state authorities in identifying the remains.

About 100 soldiers, marines and federal and state police on Saturday cordoned off the area where the grave site was found in the poor Pueblo Viejo district of Iguala, which is about 120 miles (200 kilometres) south of Mexico City.

Blanco said eight more people had been arrested in the case, adding to the 22 Iguala city police officers detained after a police confrontation with student protesters last weekend set off a series of violent incidents in the city.

The prosecutor has said state investigators had obtained videos showing that local police arrested an undetermined number of students after the initial clash and took them away.

He said some of the eight newly arrested people were members of an organized crime gang, adding that some of them had given key clues leading to the discovery of the mass grave.

Blanco said his investigators had found that “elements of the municipal police are part of organized crime.” He also said his office was searching for Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and had alerted officials across Mexico to be on the lookout for him.

The governor had charged earlier in the week that organized crime had infiltrated the city government.

State prosecutors have said the first bloodshed occurred when city police shot at buses that had been hijacked by protesting students from a teachers college, killing three youths and wounding 25. A few hours later, unidentified masked gunmen shot at two taxis and a bus carrying a soccer team on the main highway, killing two people on the bus and one in a taxi.

Violence is frequent in Guerrero, a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory.

The Aytozinapa Normal school attended by the missing students, like many other schools in Mexico’s “rural teachers college” system, is known for militant and radical protests that often involve hijacking buses and delivery trucks.

In December 2011, two students from Aytozinapa died in a clash with police on the highway that leads to the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco. Students had allegedly hijacked buses and blocked the road to press demands for more funding and assured jobs after graduation. Two state police officers were charged in the shootings.

During that confrontation, students apparently set fire to pumps at a gas station on the highway when federal and state police moved in to quell the protest, and a gas station employee later died of burns suffered in the attack.",discuss

In response to a question about the reported deaths of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and some of his advisors in an air strike, (Pentagon spokesman Army Col. Steve) Warren  said the U.S. has not conducted any targeted airstrikes against specific ISIL personnel.

“I hope he’s dead. We certainly hope he’s dead, but we haven’t conducted any strikes against him,” he said.

“With every terrorist that we kill from the air, that is one less terrorist on the ground,” the colonel added.

Warren also said this in talking about the airstrikes against ISIS:

Certainly, ISIL forces realize that when American airpower is deployed, their chance of survival goes to nil.”

Georgy Myakinkin, 31, left his keys at work following his shift at Pulkovo Airport in St Petersburg, Russia.

When he returned to collect them, he says ""heavy-handed"" security guards stopped him 'unnecessarily' and told him he had to remove his belt.

Staging an impromptu protest, he then stripped naked - apart from his socks - before sauntering through the scanner, leaving the guards gobsmacked.

He said: ""I returned to the airport and was just in the section where trains arrive with passengers when I was stopped and asked to remove my belt before going through a scanner.

""I know the rules and I know that it isn't necessary here in the pre-flight area to be so strict - security guards were just being heavy-handed.

""When I refused and told them I wanted to just get my keys, they called police.""

CEN   Strip-gate: But he left socks on before passing through

Georgy whipped off his clothes and walked through the scanner. The speechless officers then allowed him to dress and leave.

But when he turned up for work the next day, he discovered that the CCTV security camera video had been leaked and gone viral.

The Russian Interior Ministry's transport department in the Northwestern Federal District said it is currently investigating the alleged breach of security.

YouTube user ""ltclassics"" explains that the episode in the upper right hand corner is a recent TBS syndicated Seinfeld rerun. The episode on the lower right hand corner was supposedly a decade-old digitally recorded Seinfeld rerun.

 
So. Let's talk about efficiency. In the last two decades, American productivity has improved at striking levels, with very little benefit for the American worker. Some of this has to do with automation, and a lot of it has to do with the spread of personal computers. As the workplace is measured, re-measured, and examined to the point of indecency—look at the conditions Amazon warehouse employees have to work under—efficiency is slowly chipping away at our lives.

Even if this Seinfeld thing turns out to be a hoax—I am hedging my bets here, because I do not own a stopwatch or rent cable television—it's such a great symbol for America in the 21st century. You can picture some stuffed suit in middle-management watching the same Seinfeld episode sped up to various percentages—3.5, 10, 12.5—to see how the jokes land. They probably focus-tested specific jokes in midwestern malls in order to find the razor's edge of comedy, the exact line before Jerry Seinfeld turns into Alvin and the Chipmunks and the timing of all the jokes is ruined. Quantifiably it's the same show, but in reality it's stretched to just before the breaking point, analyzed and efficiency-tested in order to cram more salable real estate into a lot that refuses to change size. The life is being sucked out of it, one decimal point at a time.",unrelated

Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured. Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page. The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story ""mere propaganda"". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible. Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting. Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north. Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg's status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet.

New York Magazine's Jessica Pressler profiled him in a recent issue.

But a number of folks who know Islam told Business Insider that they strongly believe that the $72 million figure is just a rumor - a rumor that Islam hasn't denied.

In the article, he acknowledged to Pressler over caviar and apple juice that his net worth was in the ""high eight figures.""

A source familiar with the story told Business Insider that Islam is not worth $72 million. The source believes it's a rumor started by Islam's friends or partners that was perpetuated by the New York Magazine article.

Pressler has also defended the story. She Tweeted that she saw a bank statement with the eight figures and is comfortable with what's in the piece. She also Tweeted that New York Magazine ""is not a financial publication.""

Business Insider actually featured Islam on our list of ""20 Under 20"" in finance just over a year ago. He was nominated by his peers.

In a phone interview on Monday Islam's partner Damir Tulemagabetov, who was also in the New York Magazine article, said the $72 million figure isn't necessarily completely accurate.

""Let me put it this way...it's stated as a rumor,"" Tulemaganbetov told us when we asked him if he would deny the $72 million figure. He was with Islam in a car headed to CNBC's studios in New Jersey.

""All the hype, [Islam] deserves it,"" Tulemaganbetov said. Adding that he is ""pretty sure"" Islam is a ""a great trader"" and that he's a ""genius.""

Business Insider asked for audited numbers or P&L statements to prove that Islam's networth is close to $72 million. Tulemaganbetov refused.

Islam himself did not respond to our email this morning requesting the numbers. He also would not get on the phone when Business Insider learned he was riding in the car to CNBC.

The investment club for young traders, of which Islam is a member, sent Business Insider this statement regarding the $72 million figure:

It has been brought to the attention of the Leaders Investment Club that Mohammed Islam has been rumored to have made $72,000,000 through making trades in the stock market. After performing due diligence and talking with Mohammed Islam himself, we have determined that these claims are false and simply been blown up by the media in the interests of sensationalism.

Islam's partner Tulemaganbetov, however, would not be that clear in his coversation with Business Insider.

""We can't just talk about the numbers. It's not just about the money,"" Tulemaganbetov said. ""We're on the verge of a lot of great things in our lives so we can't just focus on providing you the statements. We're on the verge of a lot of great things. We are going to talk to CNBC.""

Again, Business Insider pressed the issue of the P&L statements.

""All those statements...that's good for you. We know what we're doing. We're managing this whole hype and everything. We are trying to work with it. We were never expecting it and never denied. You have no proof.""

Tulemaganbetov told us that Islam didn't expect all the attention. He just expected a magazine article.

""The guy became famous all over the world in 24 hours. He's all over the world. The next thing we wake up and he's famous. This guy is a celebrity all over the world right now.""

565,"Apple's New MacBook Will Be A Thinner, Cleaner, Faster 12-Inch MacBook Air","If 9to5Mac’s latest findings are true, than Apple’s biggest product of the year could be the MacBook Air. (You know, right behind the Apple Watch.) According to early reports, Apple has completely redesigned the MacBook Air, ditching the full-sized USB port, MagSafe connector, and SD card slots for something entirely different.

9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman writes: “The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model. The new 12-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display. In order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current 11-inch model, the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides.”

profilecompare copy
9to5Mac's artist Michael Steeber designed renditions of what the new Air could look like. Here's a side view of the rumored 12-inch Air (left) compared to the current 11-inch Air (right).

Why this matters: We already have an 11-inch MacBook Air... and a 13-inch, too. So, doesn’t a 12-inch just seem unnecessary? To keep up the MacBook Air’s reputation of being ultra-light and ultra-portable, it makes sense to keep the Air’s screen size at 13-inches or less. However, something smaller than 11-inches will just be too small. So, the 12-inch could actually fill that “just right” sweet spot nicely.

It’s not all about the size
However, if 9to5Mac’s design estimates are correct, this is the start of a new design shift for the MacBook Air. We’ll see features that are slimmer and more compact than before, with an edge-to-edge keyboard, a modified trackpad, and a thinner profile (yes, the Air will actually be getting smaller).

566,"Woman detained in Lebanon is not al-Baghdadi's wife, Iraq says","When FXX took over the syndication rights of The Simpsons last year, one of the stipulations were older episodes with longer run-times were going to be edited to the modern standard of 22 minutes in order to fit in the now normal 8 minutes of advertising found within half-hour programming.

Not every network is so keen on trimming whole scenes to make run-times work for older shows, but that doesn’t mean they’re immune to tricks of their own. That’s reportedly what’s happening over at TBS.

Thanks to one crafty viewer, it seems to have been discovered that TBS has been running syndicated episodes of Seinfeld 7.5% faster than the show’s standard speed in order to squeeze in as much advertising as possible into the airspace. Unfortunately, while it’d be nice to say this news is shocking, it isn’t. These shows were meant to air at a time when most sitcoms ran 25 minutes, and thus it’s either this or a trim to The Simpsons in order to make them fit modern standards.

Mind you, Variety technically says that Bale is merely ""in talks,"" but the rest of the article seems pretty certain that it's a done deal.

In case you've forgotten, Sony's film is the one penned by Aaron Sorkinwho also wrote the scripts for The Social Network and Moneyball) is directed by Danny Boyle (remember Slumdog Millionaire?) and is actually based on Walter Issacson's official biography of Steve Jobs. In other words, it's shaping up to be a class act. Maybe it'll be enough to wash away memories of that other Jobs film. [Variety]",unrelated
568,Seth Rogen To Play Steve Wozniak In Steve Jobs Biopic,"Batman as Steve Jobs? Sure. How about that guy from Superbad as Woz, too?
Seth Rogen has reportedly signed on to star as Steve Wozniak in the upcoming Steve Jobs film from Sony. You know, the as-yet-untitled biopic written by Aaron Sorkin, creator of ""The Newsroom"" and ""The West Wing.""
The comic actor would join Christian Bale, who is tipped to play Jobs, according to Variety.
Sony's flick would be the fourth such feature film that's either in the works or has already been made about Jobs, sharing the marquee with 2013's ""Jobs"" (the one with Ashton Kutcher), ""iSteve"" from the same year (the one made by Funny or Die), and 1999's ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"" (the one where the iPhone hadn't been invented yet). One might argue that the world is a bit Jobs'd out, but we suppose it depends on the strength of Sorkin's script and Danny Boyle's directing.
On the plus side, the film is based on Walter Isaacson's biography of the late Apple CEO—titled simply, ""Steve Jobs""—which was Amazon's best-selling book for 2011.
If you ask Sorkin, though, the movie isn't entirely biographical per se.
""It's not a biopic; it's not the story of Steve Jobs—it's something much different than that. He's a fascinating guy—part hero, part antihero,"" Sorkin said earlier this year, as reported by Mashable.
""I don't want to make any news or make anyone feel like I approached the movie in a different way. I'm going to make the movie speak for itself. But he's a fascinating guy surrounded by fascinating people, and he had very interesting relationships with the people in his life,"" Sorkin said in a separate interview.
Rogen isn't officially on board just yet, per The Hollywood Reporter, and it's unknown whether an official offer has been made or even if any kind of negotiations have taken place. Bale is supposed to be in the midst of negotiations to appear as Jobs.
Leonardo DiCaprio was first tapped for the role of Jobs, but dropped out earlier this month to take a role in ""The Revenant."" After that, DiCaprio plans to take a long break from acting, according to The Hollywood Reporter.",discuss
569,Mechanical polar bear ‘threatened with ASBO for singing Christmas songs’,"Central Bedfordshire Council has refuted newspaper reports which suggested it was about to issue an Anti-Social Behaviour Order (Asbo) to a six-foot mechanical bear.

The polar bear, named Bernard, is situated outside the Loft Cafe in Shefford and performs Christmas carols to passers-by but a story in the Bedfordshire on Sunday newspaper suggested residents feared it “could be hit with an Asbo after receiving complaints”.

However, a press officer for the council told i100.co.uk that the story was “embellished” and there had been “absolutely no mention of an Asbo or a gagging order, or anything like that”.

The council did acknowledge that one noise complaint had been made about the bear and council officers were therefore “legally obliged” to investigate it but subsequently deemed it not to be a nuisance.

We have received one complaint regards a Christmas carol-singing bear and have visited the premises on a number of occasions and, while Bernard has not been deemed a nuisance, we have written to both parties, explaining the situation as part of an ongoing investigation.

The council takes noise complaints seriously and has a legal obligation to fully investigate them, but we also want everyone in Central Bedfordshire to enjoy themselves over the Christmas period and would urge residents and business owners alike to be mindful of their neighbours and the local community when planning festivities.

Central Bedfordshire Council statement
The story in the Bedfordshire on Sunday, which was picked up by the Metro and the BBC, has subsequently been updated with a small disclaimer at the end saying: “Central Bedfordshire Council would like to make clear no ABSO proceedings have been brought against Bernard nor has he officially been ‘gagged’.”

Government guidelines say that anyone over the age of 10 can be given an Asbo for “drunken or threatening behaviour, vandalism and graffiti and playing loud music at night”. Sadly, it makes no mention of mechanical polar bears or any other inanimate objects for that matter.",discuss

The troubled actor, who at one point was reportedly entrenched in heroin addiction that friends feared he had only months to live, is once again the subject of a hoax claiming that he was found dead in his Manhattan apartment.

News that Macaulay Culkin had allegedly died spread quickly on Facebook and Twitter, with users linking to a story on something called MSNBC.website.com (which is entirely separate from the real MSNBC). The report read:

Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.

Multiple unconfirmed reports say Culkin was found dead Friday afternoon in his Manhattan apartment after police responded to a wellness check requested by a family member.

At least one occupant of the Manhattan apartment confirmed the apartment belongs to Culkin but police have not confirmed the man’s identity at this time.

“The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today,” said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department.

It has been only a few months since the last hoax claiming that Macaulay Culkin is dead. The actor was also reported dead back in April, with Facebook users mourning his alleged death and even a memorial page popping up.

“At about 11 a.m. ET on Sunday (April 20, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away,” the report claimed. “Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.”

Reportedly, the new 1 WTC offices of Vogue magazine are being swarmed by rodents. Editor-in-child, Anna Wintour, is said to be naturally disgusted and would not step foot into the new offices until these rodents are removed.  The report details that the influential editor-in-chief already asked her staffers to clean her office before she ever set foot in there. Fortunately, Anna Wintour is not yet expected to work in the new offices until 2015. 

A Vogue employee told Gawker last Friday afternoon that the pests cannot be tolerated for work purposes. Moreover, because of the many rodents and vermins scuttling around, the editorial department of the high-caliber magazine might delay its move from the old Times Square offices. The sales and marketing departments have already moved in. The employee added that even though it may sound laughable, but the company is facing a serious concern if these creatures are not removed. The employee explains that there is a possibility that these creatures could nibble the clothing they have in the office.

This rat infestation problem is remarkable considering how excited the company seems to be about moving to their new posh premises. Before this report, Vogue had posted the move in a special online story. The company has also been steadily showing off pictures and videos of the new offices, even Anna Wintour's through Instagram.

Page Six reports that not everyone is sympathetic towards the company.

""Security couldn't even stop BASE jumpers from ­entering the building and leaping from the top. You think they could stop some rats?"" a commenter named ""4npower"" said.

The British Isis militant known as Jihadi John has been identified in reports today as Mohammed Emwazi, from London.

In a lengthy article by The Washington Post, identifying the man suspected of appearing in videos showing the beheading of US and UK hostages, a 2010 report in The Independent is cited, which details claims that Emwazi was detained for 'days' and illegally interrogated by MI5 while on a safari holiday in Africa, before being let go.

It has now been claimed Emwazi started to become radicalised following the events on this trip.

Below is the full report, in which Emwazi is identified as Muhammad ibn Muazzam, from The Independent on Saturday, 01 May, 2010.

British Muslims on safari 'stopped by MI5' (from The Independent on 01/05/2010)

MI5 agents illegally interrogated British Muslims who were detained while on safari holidays in Africa, it was claimed yesterday.

The new allegations mirror cases first raised by The Independent last year in which the security service was accused of harassing and intimidating north London community workers who had returned from Somalia.

Now two British men from west London who visited Tanzania for a week-long safari in May last year say they were arrested and held for “days” in inhumane detention on the orders of MI5.

Abu Talib and Muhammad ibn Muazzam, both in their mid-20s, and a German friend travelling with them, allege they were threatened with beatings by members of Tanzania's security forces. After being refused entry to Tanzania they were returned to the Netherlands, where they say they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists.

On their return to the UK the next day, the men allege they were harassed by MI5, who warned them they were now on a terror watch list which prevented them travelling to any Muslim country. Another British citizen, Abu Omar, 19, says that in April 2009 his safari holiday to Kenya was interrupted when the house in which he was staying was raided by local security officers.

Mr Omar claims he was held and questioned for four days, also on the basis of intelligence supplied by MI5. He alleges that his interrogators threw a mobile phone at him which they said had his fingerprints on and was linked to phone calls made to Osama bin Laden. Back in London Mr Omar was further questioned by MI5, who took his fingerprints and photographs.

He told the human rights group Cageprisoners: ""I was left in the airport without money, barefoot and my clothes in bin liners.""

The new cases bear striking similarities to allegations made by six youth workers from Kentish Town who allege that they too were harassed and unlawfully interrogated after holidays abroad in 2008. Cageprisoners' executive director, Asim Qureshi, said: ""The last seven years of the 'War on Terror' have seen the profiling and criminalisation of the Arab and Pakistani communities by UK authorities around the world. The policies implemented through counter-terrorism legislation and Prevent [the Government's strategy for combating extremism in the Muslim community] have been counter-productive as Muslim communities feel marginalised. Many Muslims feel besieged and the policies of Government have done nothing to temper that.""

A government spokeswoman said the Security Service ""operated within the law"" and complaints about officers' alleged behaviour should be made to the independent commissioner who has the power to investigate allegations.",unrelated

""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast,"" Jorge Santamaria told the Associated Press. ""We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave.""

Shane Smith, the co-founder and chief executive of Vice Media, has taken his place among the high-rollers in Las Vegas after winning $1m at the Bellagio casino and spending $300,000 of his winnings on a meal for more than 30 employees and business partners.
The lavish meal at Bellagio’s Prime Steakhouse took place during the Consumer Electronics Show. It included bottles of wine costing $15,000 each and was so expensive it merited a mention on the quarterly earnings call of MGM Resorts, the group which owns the Bellagio and other Las Vegas casino hotels.

Jim Murren, MGM Resorts chief executive, told analysts on the call that he had not seen a meal with such a hefty price tag since 2007. “It tells you there is a release valve that has opened,” Mr Murren said. “That isn’t a trend, but it’s a sign people are ready to spend money again.”
Despite the meal’s eye-watering price tag, Mr Smith is not the biggest spending media chief executive to play the Las Vegas tables. Kerry Packer, the late Australian billionaire, was a regular in Las Vegas and was known to bet as much as $150,000 a hand. His visits to casinos often made the difference between gaming operators reporting profits or losses in their quarterly earnings.
Mr Smith’s identity as the buyer was first revealed by Bloomberg. He declined to comment on the meal.
However, Vice Media is not lacking in confidence. The youth-focused company will go on a “deal spree” in 2015 and explore an initial public offering if market conditions remain favourable, Mr Smith told the FT in December.
The company has strengthened its senior management team with the appointment of James Schwab, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer, as co-president, who will help oversee a $500m “war chest” for content, technology and distribution deals.
“Vice will go on a deal spree in 2015,” said Mr Smith. “Our war chest is the size of the full valuation of our competition so we will see some major . . . deals happen.”

Two Republican lawmakers told BuzzFeed News Wednesday suspected terrorists have infiltrated the U.S.–Mexico border and as many as 10 fighters have been captured, but Homeland Security officials deny any such thing has happened.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, said four alleged terror suspects were captured on Sept. 10 in Texas. In an interview Wednesday, Chaffetz said the men flew from a Middle Eastern country to Mexico City, where they paid a smuggler to take them to and across the border. From there, the men ended up in a safe house for immigrants. They were en route to New York City, Chaffetz said, when they were captured.

Chaffetz would not reveal his source of the information, but said he confirmed it with government officials. “I had an informant tell me about it and then I questioned the Secretary of Homeland Security,” he said. “I have no doubt about its authenticity.”

The four alleged terror suspects had affiliations with groups other than the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Chaffetz said. He added that they were still being held in Texas as of Wednesday.

California Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican who represents San Diego County, made headlines Tuesday when he said to Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren that he had “asked Border Patrol” about terrorists and learned that several had been captured.

Hunter claimed 10 terror suspects had been caught near the border, including four people allegedly captured in September.

“I know at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” he said on the program.

Hunter’s spokesman Joe Kasper told BuzzFeed News the congressman’s assertion that 10 terror suspects had been captured along the border included the same four people described by Chaffetz. Kasper claimed four other suspects had been captured within the last 36 hours, and pointed to a Judicial Watch story that allegedly “confirmed” the most recent captures to back up his assertion.

Two additional suspects were picked up sometime after the first group in September, but before this week, Kasper said.

The Department of Homeland Security strongly denied Hunter’s claim that terror suspects had been caught near the border.

When reached for comment, Customs and Border Protection referred BuzzFeed News to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which did not respond to emails Wednesday. However, DHS released an identical statement to both The New Republic and ABC News denying that there were terrorists coming across the border:

The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.

But Hunter isn’t buying that explanation. His spokesman told BuzzFeed News Wednesday that they have evidence from reliable sources about “foreign nationals” being captured along the border. Kasper said those foreign nationals may not technically be ISIS fighters, but do have suspected terror group affiliations. Kasper did not identify his sources but said that Hunter’s office remains convinced that the lawmaker was correct.

The issue of terrorists coming over the U.S.–Mexico border has been a contentious and increasingly politicized one.

Among the other claims about terrorists using the border to enter the country, Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said ISIS may be teaming up with Mexican drug cartels. Audio recorded at a town hall apparently showed Cotton saying that ISIS could potentially attack people in Arkansas, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.

Cotton did not respond to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment Wednesday, but when the Post asked about the statements his spokesman pointed to a series of conservative websites.

President Obama is reluctant to do anything about the Islamic State’s spread, other than to order airstrikes. Over the past few days, those airstrikes have helped the Kurdish and Iraqi forces fight IS. Iraqi forces recaptured the strategic Mosul dam.

But IS is far from broken. They still hold Mosul and several other Iraqi and Syrian cities. They are still capturing Iraqi Christians and Yazidis and reportedly selling captured women into sex slavery. They are murdering people by the dozens, by the hundreds. IS has designs on consolidating its power in Iraq and Syria and using that as a springboard to attack the United States and Europe. Tellingly, the murderer in the IS video of Foley’s execution — which I won’t post here — has a British accent.

That may be because Apple is still working out this detail, as a new report suggests.

Attributing anonymous sources, Re/code's John Paczkowski reports that Apple isn't happy with the watch's battery life just yet. In its current form, the watch's battery life will not break any industry standards, Paczkowski says.

Right now, the Apple Watch's battery life is about one day, but Paczkowski's sources say Apple is working on some modifications to make the watch last longer on a charge before its 2015 launch.

This aligns with what we've heard from Apple as well, since a company representative told us the watch can be charged at night. Apple hasn't offered any further comment on the watch's battery life.

Battery life has been one of the biggest obstacles facing wearable devices. That's because a lot of smartwatches run on components that are meant for smartphones and aren't properly optimized for wrist-worn gadgets, Chris Jones, vice president and principal analyst with Canalys Insight, told Business Insider in a previous interview.

""We're expecting so much from these early products in the market when we don't really have dedicated components to go inside these devices,"" Jones said. ""We're nowhere near seeing the best of what can be developed out there.""

As the BBC prepares to make 60 new episodes of the hugely popular Teletubbies, the laughing tot in the sun – who featured in all 365 programmes – is now 19 and a university student.

At the age of nine months, Jess Smith was selected to be the giggling Baby Sun who looks over Teletubbyland.

The news will come as no surprise to people who have known Jess for a long time, but she said it is not something she really talked about as she was quite a shy child and “everyone knowing would have been a bit scary”.

The former Chatham South and Horsted Primary School pupil made the decision to tell people during her first week at university, when they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

Jess Smith, from Chatham, now aged 19
She said: “I thought I may as well tell them as I’m going to be spending the next three years with them.”

Jess, a first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University, then broke the news on Facebook.

She wrote: “So I’ve recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I’ve decided it’s time to tell everyone. I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I’ve gained the confidence to come out with it.

“I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be ‘the sun’ but only I could tell you the real story.”

In 1996, her mother, Anji Smith, took her to Edenbridge Hospital to be weighed and a health visitor, who had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies, put Jess’s name forward.

Mrs Smith said it was never intended to be a big thing: “It was just something a bit different to do and we didn’t expect it to be as big as it was.

“They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad. We didn’t hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she’d been picked. It was really weird seeing her on television.”

And as no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home.",agree
580,80's Brat Pack star Judd Nelson forced to deny that he's dead after fake news story starts trending on social media,"LONDON -- A pickup truck once owned by a plumbing company in Texas has somehow found its way to the front lines of Syria's civil war and been converted into an anti-aircraft weapon for Islamic militants.

A photo posted to Twitter on Monday by the Ansar al-Deen Front, an Islamic extremist brigade seemingly comprised largely of Chechen fighters, shows the Ford F-250 with a militant standing in the bed firing the anti-aircraft gun.

Speaking to CBS News Tuesday morning, a representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said the vehicle was sold to the AutoNation dealership in Houston in Oct. 2013, and that's the last they knew of it.

The company has been besieged by phone calls -- including threats -- since the photo appeared online, clearly showing the company's name and phone number. CBS News is not identifying the company due to the nature of some of the attention it has received.

They have employed an attorney and intend to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo from the Internet.

Reached by CBS News Tuesday morning, a person identifying himself as a manager at AutoNation would not comment on the sale history of the vehicle in question, saying ""we can't give information like that over the phone,"" before hanging up the phone.

The representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said they would ""most definitely"" be removing their logo from all vehicles sold in the future.

Ansar al-Deen Front has been fighting in the complicated Syrian war primarily around Aleppo, Syria's largest city and formerly the economic powerhouse of the nation.

On Tuesday night, Representative Duncan Hunter, a Republican from California, took those comments even further.

582,Vladimir Putin’s Motorcade Looks Like A Massive Knob,"On Friday, Nigerian armed forces chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh announced a ceasefire between President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration and the extremist group Boko Haram. Bedeh claimed the truce, which was widely welcomed, would lay the groundwork for the release of the more than 200 girls who were abducted in April, spurring the explosion of the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls.

On Saturday, the supposedly appeased group launched an attack on a town in Adamawa State in eastern Nigeria, capturing 40 women and planting a flag in the town of Wagga. They also beheaded six victims during an assault on Friday, after the ceasefire deal was announced. All of which makes a truce, supposedly negotiated with the “chief of security” of the Boko Haram group and the Nigerian government, seem decidedly shaky.

The ceasefire claims, and Boko Haram’s subsequent actions, have left people in Nigeria scratching their heads, with experts saying the ceasefire may have been a mirage, either a fraud concocted by the government or the middleman who brokered the agreement, whose real-life links to Boko Haram are now in dispute.

Alleged Boko Haram envoy Danladi Ahmadu is now under scrutiny, with many questioning whether he is in fact the group’s chief of security and has the authority to speak on its behalf. During an interview on Friday, Ahmadu didn’t explicitly say that Boko Haram had agreed to a ceasefire, and he did not give details of the girls’ release, Arab News reports. Elders in Borno state in Nigeria’s north-east have publicly said that they believe the government was negotiating with a fraudster, and have yet to talk to the real Boko Haram.

Boko Haram, meanwhile, has not released a public statement about the ceasefire. Rather, they have continued on a weekend campaign of violence, holding running battles with Nigerian security forces, who say that they have yet to receive any word from their superiors ordering them to cease fire in skirmished with the insurgents.

“It is not clear who the said Boko Haram negotiator is, and whether he has the mandate of the entire group or just a faction of the entire group,” Arab News quoted Nnamdi Obasi, senior analyst of Nigeria for Crisis Group, an independent, nongovernmental organization.

Some people think the announcement is a political move by President Jonathan to inspire optimism in voters and win their support, as it’s rumored he will announce his run for re-election in February 2015 over the next few weeks. The government said it has been working on negotiations with Boko Haram for months.",unrelated

585,Mass grave found after 40 students disappear in Mexican protest,"Read this story in Spanish at CNNMexico.com

(CNN) -- Gunmen opened fire at buses carrying students and soccer players in southern Mexico.

It's been more than a week since that violent night of shootouts in Iguala, Mexico. Authorities say three students were among six people killed in the September 26 violence, and 43 students remain missing.

Where are they? Authorities and witnesses fear they may be close to unraveling the mystery.

Along a dirt road in a remote part of Mexico's Guerrero state, authorities turned up unmarked graves full of human remains on Saturday.

Investigators found the remains of at least 28 people inside the graves, Guerrero State Attorney General Iñaky Blanco Cabrera told reporters Sunday. The bodies were covered in gasoline and burned before they were buried, he said, and it could take between two weeks and two months to identify them.

A tip from suspects detained after the shootouts led them to the grave sites, authorities said.

The missing students, who were studying to become school teachers at Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa, were mostly young men in their 20s, according to a website state government officials have set up to help in the search.

""Help us find them!"" the website says, offering a reward of 1 million pesos ($74,000) for information leading to the missing students.

State officials, who've faced sharp criticism over the students' disappearance, released a statement Sunday detailing their investigative efforts. So far more than 30 people have been detained, including 22 local police officers.

The police have denied attacking anyone, according to a government statement on their detention.

But protesters from the school have said officials aren't doing enough.

""NOW IT IS MORE DANGEROUS TO BE A STUDENT THAN A CRIMINAL,"" one post on a Facebook page dedicated to the school said.

Witnesses have accused police of orchestrating and participating in the shootings.

""The goal of the police was to kill any person that was inside the perimeter they had,"" one student from the school told CNN en Español.

Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre has defended his government's response and called for calm in the face of protests.

""To the family and friends of those who were savagely massacred, I offer all my solidarity and support,"" he said in a series of Twitter post Saturday. ""It would be highly condemnable, those who want to take advantage or politically profit from a situation like the one that today overwhelms and saddens us.""

A bus carrying members of the third division Chilpancingo Hornets soccer club was also among those ambushed in what authorities described as three attacks on September 26. A 15-year-old player on the team was killed.

Omar Sanchez, one of his teammates, described the ambush to CNN en Español.

""We were just watching a movie and we saw the bullets come in and then it was like we were going off a cliff and the bus tipped over. And it was then that they started firing at us with machine guns,"" he said. ""It sounded so ugly, the gunshots and my teammates screaming, 'Help, leave us alone, we are injured.' A teacher said, 'you have already blinded me, please, we are the team from Chilpancingo.""

The armed men said they weren't going anywhere, ordering the team to open the door.

""Now you are going to be taken, we are going to kill all of you,"" the gunmen said, according to Sanchez.

When the teacher refused to open the door, Sanchez said, the men opened fire again.

The case has left many troubling questions unanswered. Key among them: Who gave the orders to open fire, and what was their motive?

State prosecutors first said last week that the violence started after the college students commandeered three buses, and city police opened fire.

Since then, evidence has tied the Guerreros Unidos criminal group, and police connected with them, to the shooting and the students' disappearance, Blanco told reporters Saturday.

In 2013: 54 bodies found in mass graves in Mexico

For years Guerrero state, which includes Iguala and the well-known resort city of Acapulco, has ranked among the Mexican states with the highest homicide rates, a crime statistic regularly used by officials and analysts when discussing the overall security situation.

Figures released by Mexico's National Statistics and Geography Institute last year painted a grim picture of kidnapping throughout the country.

A survey revealed that there were more than 105,000 kidnappings nationwide in 2012, the institute said, but only about 1,300 of them were reported to authorities.

586,Small Meteorite Strikes in Nicaragua's Capital City of Managua,"FORT DEVENS, Massachusetts -

Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, was the victim of an “unfortunate accident” yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just weeks after his high-profile trial began, according to warden Paul Jacobson.

Corrections officers reportedly found the alleged terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby.

“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. “We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”

“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. “The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”

“Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence,” said warden Jacobson. “Because of the nature of Tsarnaev’s crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev were both suspected of perpetrating the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15, 2013. The bombings killed three people and reportedly injured as many as 264 others. Shortly after the FBI named the two suspects and released images of them, the two brothers reportedly killed an MIT police officer and carjacked an SUV in a shootout with police. During the shootout, the elder brother, Tamerlan was captured but was killed when his brother drove over him with the SUV. On the evening of April 20, 2013, the wounded Dzhokhar was found unarmed and hiding in a boat on a trailer in Watertown, Massachusetts.

On January 30, 2014, United States Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the federal government would seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev. The trial had just begun on January 5, 2015, as Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him.",unrelated
587,Macaulay Culkin Hasn’t Died Despite What Everyone Is Saying On Facebook,"Update: Since the publication of this article, several people have reported that this may be a hoax.

A 'feminist' blog from the US has caused outrage after its author apparently admitted aborting her male fetus based on her negative past experiences of men.

In an article so astounding it is difficult to believe it is actually true, 'Lana' even expresses surprise that ""many friends, and several of my own family members have completely cut off communication with me"".

The author purports to have fallen pregnant in 2012 and was overjoyed at the thought until she discovered she was to have a boy at which point she decided to have an abortion.

Read the full blog post here

Abortion based on gender is illegal in the UK but just this week religious groups wrote to MPs to support an amendment to the 1967 Abortion Act to clarify the point.

The amendment reads: ""Nothing in section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 can be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child.""

The practise is said to still happen in the UK particularly in ethnic communities where boys are more valued than girls.

In the blog, Lana details one of the negative experiences that was so terrible she felt she could not ""bring another monster into the world"".

The story begins aboard a plane on the way to an Occupy Wall Street rally in San Francisco. A man sat next to her upon discovering where she is going says: ""B****** like you need to learn their place.""

Lana screams ""assault"" and a male attendant rushes over but refuses to do anything as no physical contact was made.

She then admits considering lying but won't move to one of the only two spare seats as they are ""both back in Economy"".

She adds: ""I was flabbergasted, and then betrayed as they recommended that I move to one of the empty seats. This left me in tears.

""I knew the only way to get away was to move seats so I did so tearfully and having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.""

Lana then goes on how pregnancy made her feel her body had betrayed her so much she experienced ""crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war"".

Her decision to abort the fetus prompted furious comments.

""I almost threw up after reading this.""

""The most disturbing part of this is what if she didn't say yes to finding out the babies gender and had the baby to realize it was a boy, what would she have had done then?""

Fact that people abort kids in western world because of gender is thoroughly sick. ""after learning my fetus was male"" http://t.co/YZCR0UDfBu

Misandry means hatred of men. Feminism means equality of genders. ""Feminist Has Abortion Because Child Was a Boy"" NO. She is a misandrist

— Jenni (@lifeofjennibeck) February 9, 2015

Since the backlash, Lana appears to have written another blog to defend her position where she claims to have received death threats as a result of the original post.

Unfortunately she misses the point about why people would be angry at her and instead reiterates her right to choose what happens to her body.

I find it hard to hate anybody, their faults are not their own, but usually rather the product of an environment or social circle they have been exposed to. I beg most of you, for your own good, take a look at yourself and decide right now if you want to spend the rest of your life angry on the internet, or if you want to fight for a woman’s right to do what she wants with her body.",unrelated
588,New policy could reduce marijuana possession arrests,"Elected officials and activists in New York are reacting positively to the city's new policy that loosens how it treats people found in possession of marijuana.

Many had earlier said that young minority males often were the subject of arrests for marijuana possession, and asserted that punishment for what they considered a relatively minor crime could often affect a person's entire future.

""In light of the fact that there have been a disproportionate amount of blacks and browns subjected to low level marijuana arrests, as well as the fact that many cities around the country are legalizing marijuana use, it is timely for the City of New York to revise its policies,"" said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a New York City-based activist, in a statement.

""With excessive gun violence, hard drug trafficking, and other criminal ills that have plagued our community, I feel that the police ought to concentrate on things of importance rather than things that are now being legalized in many places around the country,"" he said.

Starting Nov. 19, anyone found with less than 25 grams of the drug on them will be issued a summons rather than being arrested, the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday. The only caveat is there must not be a warrant out for the person's arrest and they must not be found near a location that presents extra concern, such as a school, according to the city.

""This new policy will reduce unnecessary arrests for minor marijuana possession and put an end to an era where many of young New Yorkers were being arrested and saddled with criminal records for minor violations,"" de Blasio said. ""Today's action is the latest in a series of steps Commissioner Bratton and I have taken to rebuild the relationship between the NYPD and the communities they serve. We are also enhancing public safety with this new initiative by directing police resources towards more serious crime, and not wasting officer time processing unnecessary arrests.""

Voices of dissent with the current policy were underscored by Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson, who said in July that he would not prosecute low-level marijuana possession cases because of the concerns about how such arrests can affect the lives of young, minority men.

NYC MARIJUANA POLICY: Official eases practices for low-level offenses

Five black and Hispanic members of the New York City Council applauded the mayor's move and said that on Oct. 31, they jointly sent a letter to the mayor and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton calling for an end to such arrests.

""The mayor and commissioner have taken a significant step towards ensuring fewer New Yorkers face the consequences that arrest records bring,"" read a joint statement from the council members: Ritchie Torres, Rafael Espinal, Carlos Menchaca, Antonio Reynoso and Donovan Richards.

""We commend the mayor and commissioner for this move, and we will continue to monitor its implementation,"" the council members said. ""The relationship between police and communities, particularly communities of color, frayed significantly during the previous administration. Today's announcement will make substantial progress towards rebuilding that relationship. We look forward to working with the Mayor and Commissioner to implement additional measures needed to restore trust between police and communities.""",discuss

This extraordinary video shows the moment a US Marine is shot in the head by a Taliban sniper in Afghanistan - and lives to tell the tale.

The three minute, 12 second clip, filmed from a helmet camera, follows three of the US Navy's elite amphibious infantrymen as they take part in a joint helicopter raid in Now Zad, Helmand Province in 2013.

After hearing insurgent gunfire, the trio go to investigate, pausing for cover in the exit of a tunnel.

It is at this moment that the marksman strikes, a bullet from his high-powered weapon ricocheting off the helmet of the second Marine in the patrol with a loud crack.

After some choice language, the men beat a hasty retreat, warning colleagues that a sharpshooter has them in his sights.

590,Mexican cartel leader kills self; bodies in grave not missing students,"SYDNEY - An Australian man had a spider removed from his stomach after it burrowed its way into his body and survived for three days before being removed.

592,Singing polar bear facing ASBO after noise complaint,"A new survey from UBS suggests that the Apple Watch could get off to a strong start, leading the investment firm to predict sales of 24 million units and gross profit of $3.4 billion from the wearable device in its first few months alone.

In its poll of 4,000 consumers, UBS found that 10 percent of consumers said they are ""very likely"" to buy a smartwatch in the next 12 months. Applying that same percentage to the total number of eligible iPhone owners, UBS believes Apple will sell 24 million Apple Watches in its first nine months of availability.

Detailing the results in a note to investors on Monday, analyst Steven Milunovich noted that the first version of the Apple Watch has a number of limitations, most notably its dependence on a connected iPhone for functionality. But he believes the first-generation device will set up Apple for long-term success in the wearables market.

Still, in the first few months, Milunovich believes Apple will sell 24 million of its Watch with an average price between $420 and $430. That would result in sales of $10.3 billion, and with an assumed 33 percent level of gross margin, would add $3.4 billion in profit to the company's bottom line for fiscal 2015.

Apple's fiscal 2015 concludes at the end of September, so Milunovich's estimates don't include the 2015 holiday shopping season.

Looking to fiscal 2016, Milunovich's estimates increase to 40 million units, resulting in $17 billion in sales and $6.2 billion in profit. And by 2018, his projections call for Apple to be selling 67.6 million Apple Watch units in a single fiscal year.

The analyst said it's likely that the iPhone and Apple Watch will prove to be complementary products, much like the Mac and iPad. But he said it's also possible that the Apple Watch could eventually become the successor to the iPhone.

""Given that two-thirds of Apple's profit is generated by the iPhone, the company has to be concerned about the longer-term threat of replacement technology, whether it be a leap in handset technology or loss of key functions to wearables,"" Mulinovich said. ""With a sophisticated user interface and third-party apps coming on, Apple may be readying for the time when the Apple Watch encroaches on the smartphone market.""

The UBS survey also delved into specific brands, and found that for now consumers are more interested in the currently available Samsung Gear. Among respondents who plan to buy a smartwatch, 37 percent said they would purchase a SamsungGear, while 25 percent said they are waiting for the Apple Watch.

Milunovich expects the tables to quickly turn in early 2015, when the Apple Watch becomes available and shakes up the existing wearables market.

""Just as Apple wasn't the first MP3 or smartphone vendor but redefined those categories, we expect Apple Watch to become first to mind in smartwatches,"" he said.

UBS has maintained its ""buy"" rating for AAPL stock with a 12-month price target of $125.",unrelated

596,Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary: London Rapper Identified As ISIS Militant Who Beheaded James Foley,"Officials are using 'very sophisticated voice-identification technology' to home in on the masked extremist who carried out the murder of the American journalist, said Peter Westmacott, British ambassador to the U.S. A prime suspect is Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a 23-year-old London rapper who left his family a year ago to fight with the Islamist fanatics.

Authorities are close to identifying the black-clad Islamic State jihadist who beheaded an American journalist — and a prime suspect is a British-born rapper who left his parent’s million-dollar home last year to fight in Syria.

The British ambassador to the United States, Peter Westmacott, said Sunday that officials are using high-tech voice recognition tools to zero in on the masked fanatic who carried out the brutal murder of American journalist James Foley.

“We are close,” Westmacott said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “There is some very sophisticated voice-identification technology and other measures that we have got which should allow us to be very clear about who this person is before very long.”

British newspapers reported Sunday that investigators were looking at several home-grown jihadists. The prime suspect is Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a 23-year-old London rapper, who left his family’s $1 million home a year ago to fight with the Islamist fanatics and once posted a Twitter photo of himself holding a severed head, The Sunday Times reported.

He is one of six children of Abdel Abdul Bary, an Egyptian militant who is facing terrorism charges in connection with Al Qaeda’s twin 1998 bombings at the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, the son of an Egyptian militant who is facing terrorism charges, went from rapping to posing with guns as a fighter for ISIS.

After spending years in and out of Egyptian prisons, subjected to torture, the elder Bary and his wife Ragaa were granted political asylum in Britain in 1993. He was arrested for the bombings in 1998 and was extradited to the United States in 2012 after a protracted legal battle.

Ragaa’s story is told in the book, “Shadow Lives: The Forgotten Woman of the War on Terror.”

The younger Bary rapped under the name L Jinny or Lyricist Jinn Matic, and his songs had been featured on the BBC’s Radio 1 Extra, media outlets reported.

In one freestyle posted on his Facebook page, he raps about being addicted to alcohol and “the rock.”

“I swear the day when they came and took my dad, I could have killed a couple too . . . Imagine back then I was only six, picture what I’d do now with a loaded stick . . . violate my brothers and I’m filling you with lead.”

In July 2013, he posted on Facebook, “The Unknown mixtape with my bro tabanacle will be the last music I’m ever releasing. I have left everything for the sake of Allah.”

On Aug. 13, he tweeted a photo of himself in Ragga, Iraq, holding a severed head and the caption “Chilllin’ with my homie or what’s left of him,” The Times of London reported. His Twitter account was suspended soon afterward.

Bary also tweeted a threat in June: “The lions are coming for you soon you filthy kuffs (infidels). Beheadings in your own backyard soon,” according to the Sunday Times.

In March, The Daily Mail reported that Bary claimed on Twitter he and another British jihadist were kidnapped, tortured and robbed by members of a rival terrorist group.

ISIS hostages referred to him and several other militants with British accents as “the Beatles.”

The black-masked man who beheaded Foley in a video posted to YouTube on Tuesday had a distinct British accent.

Some 500 Brits have traveled to the Middle East to join the terrorist group, Westmacott said, calling it “a betrayal of all that we stand for.”

Federal officials have estimated that at least 100 Americans could be fighting with Sunni extremists who have seized territory throughout western Syria and northwestern Iraq.

U.S. lawmakers joined in sounding the alarm about the threat from the radicalized jihadists — especially the many foreign fighters with American and European passports who could easily travel to the West.

“They are one plane ticket away from U.S. shores,” Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on “Meet the Press.”

He said the number of militants with Western documents is “much higher” than the estimate of 2,000 that has been reported.

“They get new recruits every single day,” he said. “If that's a British citizen, we believe it was ... that individual goes back home and . . . buys one plane ticket, they’re in the United States,"" said Rogers. “We may or may not know who that individual is. That's what's so dangerous about this, and why we can't let them continue unabated.”

Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the militants “present the greatest threat we’ve seen since 9/11.”

“This has been festering for the last year and now it’s culminating with the killing and the beheading of an American journalist, which I think is a turning point,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”

“The American people — it has sort of opened their eyes to what ISIS really is, the true character of ISIS, how savage they really are, and their intent to harm Americans.”

The FBI and Homeland Security Department issued a bulletin to local law enforcement Friday saying there are no specific or credible threats to U.S. soil from the militant group in retaliation for intensified airstrikes in Iraq.

Foley was a freelancer who frequently reported for the Global Post and Agence France-Presse about ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. When Foley first disappeared in Syria, reports indicated that he had been captured by pro-government forces. Instead, it appears that his captors were members of ISIS. He had previously been kidnapped in Libya. 

The video that surfaced Tuesday first shows a clip from President Obama's press conference calling for air strikes against ""the terrorist group ISIL."" About halfway in, a man believed to be Foley speaks in English to his family. He's on his knees, with an ISIS guard standing over him. In a [likely ISIS-scripted] speech, he blames Obama and the U.S. government for his impending death and implores his family not to take a penny from the government. He then addresses his brother, John, who is in the U.S. Air Force. 

""I died that day, John,"" he says, referring to U.S. air strikes against the militant group. ""When your colleagues dropped that bomb on those people, they signed my death certificate.""

When the video reorients itself to focus back on Foley and his executioner, the mike previously hooked up to his shirt is gone. The militant spouts off an angry tirade against the United States, and the camera cuts away after the first few seconds of the beheading.

599,[UPDATED] 11 Men and 0 Women on Tonight's ESPN Domestic Violence Panel,"A British fighter who travelled to Iraq to stop the Islamic State claims the terror group fed a murdered kidnap victim to his own mother after she went to their headquarters and demanded to see him.

Yasir Abdulla, a security guard from Keighley, West Yorkshire decided to go to Iraq and fight against ISIS after hearing they came within six miles of taking control of his home village in Kurdistan, which he left in 2000.

It has been reported that the 36-year-old bought a set to combat fatigues online for £100 before going to Kurdistan and buying an assault rifle.

From Yorkshire to Iraq: Security guard Yasir Abdulla (left near his home and right patrolling the border of his home town of Sheikhan, Iraq) joined hundreds of fighters trying to stop the spread of ISIS

On patrol: Mr Abdulla (right) pictured with an Islamic State fighter who he and others had detained

He then joined hundreds of other Kurdish and Peshmerga forces who are trying to stop the spread of ISIS by patrolling a ten-mile front line in Iraq.

Mr Abdulla returned to the UK last week but told The Sun how an elderly Kurdish woman, whose son was captured by ISIS and taken to Mosul, went to meet the jihadis to try and secure his release and was then fed his body.

Slaughter: Mr Abdulla with a member of ISIS who he said was killed after he beheaded a Kurd

The father of four told the newspaper: 'She was determined to find her son and went to ISIS headquarters and asked to see him.

'The ISIS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

'They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were kind.

'But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said ""You've just eaten him.""'

During his time on the front line, Mr Abdulla revealed how ISIS are terrorising locals by calling them and threatening to kidnap them and bury them alive unless they surrender.

He also told of how the terror group kill prisoners they capture by throwing them on a 'human bonfire' and that he saw his own cousin killed in an ISIS attack.

But despite returning back to his family in Yorkshire, Mr Abdulla is keen to go back to Kurdistan saying he wants to finish the job in defeating ISIS.

The new details about the cruelty of ISIS come as Iraq's prime minister called on tribal fighters to abandon the jihadis ahead of an offensive to retake Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from extremists.

Haider al-Abadi offered no timeline for an attack on Tikrit, 80 miles north of Baghdad, which fell into the hands of ISIS last summer.

Proud Kurd: Mr Abdulla said Islamists threaten to kidnap locals and bury them alive if they do not surrender

ISIS and Al Qaeda are hiding messages to their followers in digitally-altered eBay photos and even pornography, a book claims.

Investigative journalist Gordon Thomas said Al Qaeda has used the tactic of 'steganography' - concealing messages in audio clips or images widely available online - to encode items listed for sale on the auction site.

It works by manipulating a sound waveform or the order of pixels in a small or invisible part of an image, a process not unlike the way teletext used to be delivered on analogue TVs.

Now Israeli intelligence service Mossad believes ISIS militants are doing the same, according to Mr Thomas.

One intelligence source told him messages are often hidden on Reddit or 'X-rated pornographic pictures which conceal documents and orders for the next target'.

The claims are contained within new chapters of Mr Thomas' book Gideon's Spies, an extract of which was published yesterday by the New York Post.

However, Shiite militias and Iraqi security forces have stationed themselves around Tikrit as state-run media has warned that the city 'will soon return to its people.'

Tikrit, which occasionally saw attacks on U.S. forces during the American occupation of the country, is one of the biggest cities held by ISIS.

It also sits on the road to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, which is also held by the extremists.

It has also been revealed that in February alone, violence across Iraq killed at least 1,100 Iraqis, including more than 600 civilians, according to the the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq.

UN envoy Nickolay Mladenov blamed the deaths on the extremist group, government forces and pro-government Shiite militias.

He explained: 'Daily terrorist attacks perpetrated by ISIS continue to deliberately target all Iraqis.

'There also concerning reports of a number of revenge killings by armed groups in areas recently liberated from ISIS.'

Last year was the deadliest in Iraq since its 2006-2007 sectarian bloodshed, with a total of 12,282 people killed and 23,126 wounded, according to the UN.

Pro-ISIS supporters wave flags as they parade through Mosul in Iraq. A British fighter has told how a Kurdish mother, whose son was kidnapped and murdered by the group, was fed his body when she travelled to Mosul demanding to see him

Yasir Abdulla also says that ISIS fighters, pictured, terrorise locals by calling them on the phone and threatening to bury them alive unless they surrender to them

600,What One Homeless Man Does with $100 Will Astonish You (VIDEO),"Apple has asked its suppliers in Asia to make a combined five to six million units of its three Apple Watch models during the first quarter ahead of the product’s release in April, according to people familiar with the matter.

Half of the first-quarter production order is earmarked for the entry-level Apple Watch Sport model, while the mid-tier Apple Watch is expected to account for one-third of output, one of these people said.

Orders for Apple Watch Edition – the high-end model featuring 18-karat gold casing – are relatively small in the first quarter but Apple plans to start producing more than one million units per month in the second quarter, the person said. Analysts expect demand for the high-end watches to be strong in China where Apple’s sales are booming.

Apple Watch Sport will start at $349. Apple hasn’t announced pricing for the other models, but Apple Watch Edition is expected to be among the most expensive products the company has ever sold, likely surpassing the $4,000 Mac Pro computer.

Apple sets production plans based on its forecast of demand for the new product. But Apple quickly adjusts these plans if sales are different than what it estimated. Suppliers say that Apple adjusts its so-called “plan of record” more often and more quickly than any other consumer-electronics company.

The orders are similar to early sales of Apple’s last major all-new product. Apple sold 7.5 million iPads in the six months after it arrived in April 2010.

They indicate that Apple expects its watch to far outpace other wearable devices, from Samsung Electronics 005930.SE -1.31%, LG Electronics 066570.SE +1.15%, Sony, Motorola MSI -0.77% and a host of fitness trackers. Research firm Canalys said last week that just 720,000 smartwatches powered by Android Wear, Google GOOGL +0.60%’s operating system for wearable devices, shipped in the last six months of 2014.

Apple declined to comment.

Apple Watch is the company’s first all-new product since the iPad. During development, the company studied a wide range of advanced health features for the Watch before scaling back its ambition for a device that does a little bit of everything.

Taiwan-based Quanta Computer 2382.TW -0.75%, the sole assembler of Apple Watch, started mass production of the new gadget earlier this year. To get ready for the April launch, thousands of Chinese workers will continue to work round the clock during the Chinese New Year holidays at Quanta’s factory in Changshu, China, said one person.",unrelated
601,#ISIS beheads photojournalist James Wright Foley in a massage to US to end its intervention in #Iraq.,"ISIS militants released gruesome video footage this afternoon of the beheading of American photojournalist James Wright Foley as a message to the U.S. to stop intervening in Iraq. Foley, a freelancer who contributed to the Global Post, was first captured in Libya in 2012, released, and then kidnapped again around Thanksgiving 2012 by unidentified gunmen in Syria. He was 39 years old.

The (extremely disturbing) video can be viewed here. @Mujahid4life tweeted stills from it, which are (aside from the one below), sickeningly graphic.

The Global Post reported the circumstances of his disappearance last year, after attempting to keep the news quiet for fear of Foley's safety:

Foley had set off toward the border in a car about an hour before his capture. A witness, a Syrian, later recounted over the phone to a journalist in Turkey that an unmarked car intercepted Foley. The witness said men holding kalashnikovs shot into the air and forced Jim out of the car.

The witness said he noticed nothing that would indicate whether the aggressors were rebel fighters, individuals looking for a ransom, members of a pro-government militia, or a religious-based group with other motivations.
He was held captive for 635 days.

In 2013, Foley's family set up a Find James Foley website for him, which states that he's the oldest of five children. His friend, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote about him for Syria Deeply last year:

Jim sees the good in nearly everything and everyone. He is a master motivator. ""You got this, dude!"" he'll say. ""That story's great, just file it already."" ...

Everybody, everywhere, takes a liking to Jim as soon as they meet him.",agree
602,Mystery man slaps shoppers around head for sneezing,"WASHINGTON — A U.S. Republican senator and frequent Mideast traveler said Thursday that the Taliban detainees released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl have been in touch with members of the al-Qaida linked Haqqani network, yet all five still are being monitored in Qatar.

The Pentagon said Thursday that it is working with Qatar and is confident that any threat posed by the former detainees can be mitigated.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, who recently visited Qatar, said he had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country but said he was assured during his visit that all five remain in the small Gulf nation.

Qatar gained public praise from President Barack Obama for brokering the controversial deal in May 2014 that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity in exchange for the release of the five senior Taliban officials who had been imprisoned for years at the U.S.-run Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.

Qatar promised Obama it would keep the five under watch for one year, although they would then be free to leave.

""It's just a year deal,"" Graham told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ""Just as sure as we're sitting here, they're going back to the fight.""

""They've had some Haqqani people come to meet with them. ... They're reaching out. The Taliban five are communicating with people inside Afghanistan.""

However, Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a leading Capitol Hill voice on foreign policy, said all five are still in Qatar.

""I was afraid one had left, but they told me they're all still there,"" he said.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it would not comment on specific cases involving the detainees.

""However, we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously, and we work in close coordination through military, intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary,"" the statement said. ""The Defense Department has a close security partnership with the government of Qatar. We're confident in our ability to continue to mitigate any threat that may be posed by the former Guantanamo detainees.""

Haqqani operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and has been one of the deadliest threats to U.S. troops in the war. The network, which the State Department designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 2012, claims allegiance to the Afghan Taliban but operates with some degree of autonomy.

The five detainees released were:

Abdul Haq Wasiq, who served as the Taliban deputy minister of intelligence.
Mullah Norullah Nori, a senior Taliban commander in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif when the Taliban fought U.S. forces in late 2001.
Khairullah Khairkhwa, who served in various Taliban positions including interior minister and had direct ties to Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden.
Mohammed Nabi, who served as chief of security for the Taliban in Qalat, Afghanistan, and later worked as a radio operator for the Taliban's communications office in Kabul.
Mohammad Fazl, who Human Rights Watch says could be prosecuted for war crimes for presiding over the mass killing of Shiite Muslims in Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001 as the Taliban sought to consolidate their control over the country.

603,"US, UK eye rapper as British-born militant who beheaded journalist James Foley","British intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6 have identified the man suspected of the horrific beheading of American journalist James Foley, according to UK media reports.

The hooded man with an English accent is believed to be 23-year-old Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, known to fellow Islamic State militants as Jihadi John.

The former rapper left his family home in an affluent west London suburb last year to fight in the civil war in Syria.

In early August he tweeted a photo of himself wearing military camouflage and a black hood, while holding a severed head in his left hand.

British SAS forces are hunting Foley's killers, using a range of high-tech equipment to track him down and potentially free other hostages.

The Mail on Sunday is reporting that a ""significant force"" of SAS personnel has been deployed to northern Iraq over the past two days, joining local units fighting IS. They have fanned out into four-man teams, accompanying Iraqi and Kurdish troops in an effort to find British jihadis.

The Sunday Times reports that Bary is the key focus of the man hunt. He is one of the British jihadists former hostages referred to as the Beatles because of their British accents. The two others were called ""George"" and ""Ringo"".

>Share this story on Facebook

The two other Britons suspected of involvement in the crime are Aine Davis, a former drug dealer who converted to Islam, and Razul Islam, who is believed to have joined the terrorist group that murdered Foley.

Bary is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trail on terrorism in Manhattan, due to his alleged involvement in the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.

Before leaving the family home to fight in Syria, Bary was an aspiring rapper known as L Jinny whose music was played on one of the UK's most popular radio stations, BBC Radio 1.

Recordings of his songs will prove vital to the investigating team, with experts using voice recognition technology to match his voice with that of the man who brutally decapitated Foley.

Bary made a number of music videos for his songs, with titles such as Flying High, Dreamer and Overdose.

It is believed he was indoctrinated by an Islamic preacher named Anjem Choudary who persuaded him to join the fight in Syria.",discuss

The reports began circulating late yesterday around Twitter:


So far there's nothing substantiating all the buzz. Cuban media outlets have denied any news conference is scheduled, and the hype also comes ""suspiciously close"" to the actual death of Fidel Castro Odinga, the 41-year-old son of a Kenya opposition leader, as the Daily Mail reports.

606,TBS Speeds up SEINFELD by 7.5% to Add 2 More Minutes of Commercials,"Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured. Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page. The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story ""mere propaganda"". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible. Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting. Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north. Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg's status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet.

607,"New York schoolboy who made $72MILLION trading stocks on his lunch breaks - and now takes his friends out to dine on $400 caviar, drives a BMW and has definitely made his immigrant parents proud","The video was one of those viral sensations that tugs on your heartstrings and compels you to watch, because it defies your expectations and shows you just how kind and compassionate human beings can be. There was only one problem.

The video was a fake — at least according to a witness who says he was there while the YouTube hit, “How Does A Homeless Man Spend $100?” was filmed.

You have probably seen the video by now — if not, view it above. Posted by the prolific prankster Josh Paler Lin — whose other videos include “Sex In The Bathroom Prank” and “Rock Paper Scissors Hickey!” — the viral video purported to be a “social experiment” in which Paler Lin gave a homeless man identified as “Thomas” a hundred bucks in cash, then “secretly” filmed him as he spent the money.

The video was picked up by dozens of media outlets, including the Inquisitr, and in the week the clip has been on YouTube, has racked up more than 28 million views.

Why? Because Thomas spent his money not on booze or drugs, but on food. And not just for himself. He used the cash to purchase and distribute food to his fellow homeless people in Orange County, California.

While determining how much revenue any particular YouTube video creates is difficult, by many estimates a video can earn between $1,000 and $5,000 for each million views it accumulates.

That means Paler Lin may have grossed anywhere from $28,000 to $140,000 off this single video — in one week.

Perhaps more important, Paler Lin created a crowdfunding campaign along with the video, to raise more money for Thomas. That campaign has so far brought in about $130,000 in donations from people moved by the selfless acts Thomas performs in the video.

But in an interview posted on the site Vocativ on Tuesday, Taugan Tan Kadalim, who says he stumbled by chance across Paler Lin filming the video and witnessed the whole thing, calls the entire scenario “bull****.”

Kadalim, 26, says that he was there at Euclid Liquor & Market where he had just purchased a lottery ticket before walking across the street to his girlfriend’s apartment, and that what he saw made it clear that “Thomas knew he was being followed.”

Kadalim says he is a fan of Paler Lin and recognized the YouTube celebrity immediately.

He then watched as Paler Lin entered the liquor store and spoke with a clerk as Thomas waited outside. Only after Paler Lin returned, Kadalim told Vocativ, did Thomas enter the liquor store.

“He drove Thomas to the liquor store,” Kadalim told the site. “While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.”

Vocativ said its reporters corroborated the story with Kadalim’s girlfriend and brother, but calls to the liquor store went unreturned. Kadalim posted a comment to the video’s YouTube page the day the video went on line, saying quote clearly that Paler Lin drove Thomas to the store, but the comment went largely ignored.

Paler Lin, however, adamantly denied faking any part of the “homeless” viral video, telling Vocativ, “There is no way we’re making any of this up. This is real.”",unrelated

609,WHO says reports of suspected Ebola cases in Iraq are untrue,"An Israeli-Canadian woman who traveled to Iraq to fight alongside the Kurds there earlier this month has been abducted by Islamic State fighters, Hebrew media reported Sunday, citing Syrian jihadist-linked media.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, was captured by jihadists near the flashpoint city of Kobani in the past few days, reports said. The former IDF soldier and Canada native was taken after the jihadists launched three suicide bombings in the area, and her condition is unknown.


The reports were not initially confirmed by the Islamic State group. In Israel, the Foreign Ministry said it was looking into the reports while stressing that the websites that carried the information were “of dubious credibility.”

Two Kurdish fighters quoted by Israel Radio cast doubt on the reports. One, an American fighter, said Rosenberg was never in Kobani. Another soldier on the ground said that he had heard nothing of her alleged abduction.

In her last Facebook post to date, Rosenberg wrote on November 20 that someone would be managing her profile for two weeks, and asked that people not message her “as this is not me.”

IS launched an attack Saturday on the Syrian border town of Kobani from Turkey, a Kurdish official and activists said, although Turkey denied that the fighters had used its territory for the raid.

The assault began when a suicide bomber driving an armored vehicle detonated an explosive device on the border crossing between Kobani and Turkey, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria’s powerful Kurdish Democratic Union Party.

The Islamic State group “used to attack the town from three sides,” Khalil said. “Today, they are attacking from four sides.”

The Islamic State group claimed three suicide attacks in Kobani’s border crossing point, the SITE Intelligence Group reported. The group, quoting Twitter accounts linked to the militants, said the suicide attacks were carried out by a Saudi and a Turkmen, adding that one of them was driving a Humvee.

The first foreign woman to join the Kurdish forces, Rosenberg set out from her home in Tel Aviv on November 2, stopping in Amman before flying to Erbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

Rosenberg told Israel Radio that she wanted to do her part for the Kurdish national struggle, and that she was hopeful her experience in the Israel Defense Forces would be useful to the Kurds.

According to Rosenberg’s Facebook page, she served in the IDF’s Home Front Command.

Rosenberg has posted pictures of herself in mountains of Iraq and Syrian Kurdistan.

“In the IDF, we say Aharai – After Me. Let’s show ISIS what that means,” she wrote, using an alternate acronym for Islamic State.

In 2009, Rosenberg was arrested in a joint Israeli police and FBI operation on suspicion that she had been part of a ring that cheated elderly American citizens out of their money by posing as lottery officials and convincing the unsuspecting seniors to pay for fictive services, according to the Walla news site. The members of the ring, which included 11 other Israeli citizens aside from Rosenberg, were said to have stolen up to $25 million.

Rosenberg was later convicted of the crime and sentenced to four years in a US prison, though her term was eventually shortened and she was deported to Israel instead, Channel 10 reported.

The Islamic State group began its Kobani offensive in mid-September, capturing parts of the town as well as dozens of nearby villages. The town later became the focus of airstrikes by the US-led coalition against the militants.

Kurdish fighters slowly have been advancing in Kobani since late October, when dozens of well-armed Iraqi peshmerga fighters joined fellow Syrian Kurds in the battles. The fighting has killed hundreds of fighters on both sides over the past two months.

If confirmed, Rosenberg would be the second Israeli captive held by the jihadist group. Israeli-American journalist Steven Sotloff was beheaded by the Islamic State group in early September. Sotloff went missing in Syria in August 2013, and the jihadists were reportedly unaware of his Jewish heritage and Israeli citizenship until after his death.

610,Indian worker sacked after going on leave for 24 years,"A British rapper whose father is awaiting trial in Manhattan for a pair of US embassy bombings is a leading suspect in the barbaric beheading of American journalist James Foley, it was revealed on Friday.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary — who recently tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head — was among three Brits identified as possibly being the masked killer known as “John the Beatle.” Bary, 24, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on terror charges tied to the deadly 1998 bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Also under investigation are the brother of a British doctor once charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents, and a former gang member who converted to Islam and traveled to Syria, Britain’s Telegraph newspaper reported.

A dozen American counterterrorism experts are expected to fly to the UK “within days” to help identify Foley’s killer, Britain’s Daily Mail reported.

Former hostages held by ISIS have said he is one of several jihadists they nicknamed “the Beatles” due to their British accents, with two of his cronies referred to as “George” and “Ringo.”

Bary, who went to Syria last year to fight in its bloody civil war, has a build, skin tone and ­accent all similar to those of “John,” according to The Telegraph.

Before becoming a jihadist, he was an aspiring rapper from West London known as “L Jinny,” whose music was played on BBC Radio 1.

Bary also appeared in music videos posted on YouTube for songs titled “Overdose,” “Flying High” and “Dreamer.”

But he was reportedly radicalized by followers of firebrand ­Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and walked out of his family’s plush home in the Maida Vale district of London last year, saying he was “leaving everything for the sake of Allah.”

Earlier this month, he was seen in a photo posted to Twitter wearing camouflage clothing and a black balaclava while holding a severed head with his left hand — the same hand “John” is seen using to draw a knife across Foley’s throat in his execution video.

According to The Telegraph, Bary is on an official list of British jihadists who may be “John.”

Also on the list is Razul Islam, 21, the paper says.

In 2012, Islam’s two older brothers — including Dr. Shajul Islam, a suspended physician with England’s National Health Service — were charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents near the Syrian border with Turkey.

But the brothers were released last year after neither British journalist John Cantile nor Dutch photographer Jeroen Oerlmans appeared to testify against them.

Another suspect is Aine Davis, 30, a former drug dealer and gang member who The Telegraph said converted to Islam and flew to Syria to wage jihad.",unrelated
611,Hidden Diagnostic Port on Apple Watch Could Allow for Smart Band Accessories [Updated],"Ahead of Monday's media event where Apple is expected to provide final details on the Apple Watch, a new report from TechCrunch details a hidden ""diagnostic port"" inside one of the channels on the Apple Watch where watch bands slip into place. While the port is currently used only for diagnostic purposes, the report argues it could be used in the future to interface with ""smart band"" accessories bringing additional functionality to the watch.The port has a 6-dot brass contact array inside the groove for the ‘bottom’ strap connector slot. Several sources have confirmed its existence and placement to me. It is very similar to the connector for the Lightning connector in iPhones, as that connector currently only uses 6 of its 8 available pins. Apple recently began opening up the Lightning port for use by third parties. A source says that this port is currently for diagnostic purposes only — but that there is nothing preventing it from being a connection port for future accessories.TechCrunch's Matthew Panzarino is careful to state that he has no knowledge of any plans by Apple to launch such smart band accessories, but the idea remains an intriguing one. Possibilities for such bands include additional sensors, external batteries integrated into a band, and more.

Apple revealed a number of high-level details about the Apple Watch at the device's unveiling last September, but even now with a launch set for next month there is still much that remains unknown, including pricing details beyond the $349 starting price. Apple will undoubtedly address many of the details at Monday's events, but some of the technical details will likely need to wait until the device launches and users and technical experts can get a closer look at the device.

Update 2:13 PM: The diagnostic port will not be included on the Apple Watch that ships to consumers, according to 9to5Mac.

The masked executioner spoke in English, with what sounded like a British accent, and said that the slaying came in response to the airstrikes ordered by President Barack Obama against Isis 12 days ago.

Isis, whose chief spokesman came under State Department sanctions on Monday, warned of further revenge – including on another man purported to be a captured US journalist, Steven Sotloff – and in the video, the victim was made to read a statement blaming the US for his own murder.

Foley has been missing in Syria since November 2012, where he went to report on the bloody struggle to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. He was initially thought to have been captured by forces loyal to the Assad regime.

A Facebook message from a support group, Free James Foley, urged patience “until we all have more information,” and asked that readers “keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

YouTube took down the gruesome video, but not before it sparked a debate on social media about the ethics of sharing it, adding a metatextual debate to a depiction of a man’s violent death.

Foley, 40, a former Stars and Stripes reporter, was captured in November 2012 near the Syrian town of Taftanaz. It was not his first detention while reporting: in 2011, he was taken while reporting on the uprising against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi’s forces ultimately released him after six weeks in captivity.

A friend of Foley’s and his fellow captive in Libya, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote in a 2013 essay that captivity was “the state most violently opposite his nature.” Gillis described Foley as gentle, friendly, courageous and impatient with “anything that slows his forward momentum.”

In a January 2013 interview with local television news near her Rochester, New Hampshire home, Foley’s mother Diane said her son was “passionate about covering the story in Syria, passionate about the people there.”

Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said US intelligence was working to determine the authenticity of the video.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said in a statement.

Messages left with the Foley family were not returned.

A day after Obama declared that Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US warplanes had broken Isis’ hold on the critical Mosul Dam, US Central Command announced two strikes near it on Monday, to “further expand control of the area.” One strike was said to have destroyed an Isis checkpoint while the other was “not successful.”

Obama has offered no timeframe for the length of his campaign against Isis. The US military has bombed over 90 targets attributed to Isis, including vehicle convoys, mobile artillery and fixed positions, since 8 August. Most of the strikes have come in the past few days, near the dam. The other strikes have occurred either to blunt an Isis advance on the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil or to lift an Isis siege on Mount Sinjar, where it chased thousands of Iraqi Yazidis whom it threatened to kill unless they converted to Islam. The US considers the siege broken.",unrelated
613,Iraqi social-media rumors claim IS leader slain,"Islamic State (Isis) militants in Mosul may have contracted Ebola, according to Iraqi media reports of suspected cases at an IS-controlled hospital in the city.

The government and Kurdish media reported that militants were displaying symptoms similar to those of Ebola. The World Health Organization has not been able to confirm this but has offered assistance to Iraqi officials.

Iraq's official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, said Ebola arrived in Mosul from ""terrorists"" who came ""from several countries and Africa"", reports Mashable.

However, it is uncertain if any IS recruits came from the Ebola-hit regions of West Africa. Most have come from Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan and Somalia.

A number of other illnesses could be to blame for the fighters' symptoms. Malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever and the Marburg virus could all be confused with Ebola as they can also cause fever, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.

IS, a group that has been known to dismiss some aspects of science and modern medicine, recently executed a number of Iraqi doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat militants. UN workers have also been prohibited from entering their territory, an intelligence analyst who specialises in Iraq told Mashable.

Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Vice founder Shane Smith recently balled out exceptionally hard on a dinner for a group of 12 at the Prime Steakhouse in Las Vegas, racking up a $300,000 check.

A source at Vice told BuzzFeed News that Smith won a sum “well north of that bill” while gambling during his week at the CES conference in Las Vegas, and paid for the dinner on his personal credit card. (A Financial Times report says Smith won $1 million; both the FT and New York Times say there were about 30 people eating on Smith’s dime.)

Smith himself hasn’t commented on the story, which is a pity, because the world needs to know the answer to a crucial question: How can you spend $300,000 on dinner?

Short of a how-to guide from the man himself, or a member of his $2.5 billion digital media empire, we’re left to speculate. So in that spirit, we checked out the menu at Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino. Here’s our best guess of how Smith and a party of 12 could have racked up a tab the value of a single-family home.

Prime’s Siberian Sturgeon Caviar with traditional accompaniments was likely a must for Smith’s group. The restaurant lists the item as market price, but Eater Las Vegas has it going for up to $2,500 per pound. A couple pounds of caviar seems reasonable.

ALLEKO/ALLEKO

Mercifully for Smith, Prime doesn’t put its wine list online. But just down the strip at Mario Batali’s Carnevino in the Wynn, a few bottles of Dom Perignon (2003) will run guests $400 each.

Jay L. Clendenin/Los Angeles Times / MCT

But what are we, farmers? Any respectable internet baron is going to spring for a couple of bottles of the best champagne in the house. At Batali’s joint, a 1.5-liter bottle of Boërl & Kroff 1998 will set you back $15,000 each.

AntonMatveev/AntonMatveev

Obviously white wine accompanies any good foodie’s fish course. Smith’s crew could have grabbed a couple bottles of the $9,000 Montrachet, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti from 2007. An average year, but sometimes compromise is necessary.

Manakin/Manakin

For the reds, perhaps a couple of vintages on the more reasonable side, like the $5,000 per bottle Sine Qua Non “Just for the Love of It” 2002 Syrah.

616,"Islamic State, in video titled ""A Message to America,"" beheads American journalist James Wright Foley who was kidnapped in 2012","President Obama said Wednesday that the United States “will be vigilant and we will be relentless” against Islamic State militants and would “do what’s necessary to see that justice is done” following the videotaped execution of an American journalist.

“Today the entire world is appalled at the brutal murder of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIL,” Obama said, using one of several acronyms for the group. The militants, who posted the video on YouTube Tuesday, said Foley’s killing was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq.

Obama, who spoke Wednesday morning to Foley’s parents, offered no new policy measures to confront Islamic State. Referring to neighboring countries and U.S. allies, he said “there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread.”

Asked whether the United States might consider suspending its airstrikes, one U.S. official said the “only question is if we do more.” Officials said that attacks against the Islamic State would continue in Iraq under an authorization Obama signed early this month.

Obama could face pressure to escalate the air campaign in Iraq and increase support to U.S.-backed rebels in Syria who are fighting against the Islamic Front, as well as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Obama has resisted pleas from the Syrian rebels for U.S. heavy weapons, including portable surface-to-air missiles, as well as for American air support.

In a statement issued after the president’s remarks, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, “We must get serious about confronting this force, including by aggressively arming those battling it.”

The White House confirmed early Wednesday that U.S. intelligence had deemed the video authentic. Obama spoke in Martha’s Vineyard, where he is vacationing with his family.

Foley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native and a photojournalist working for the Boston-based Web site Global­Post, was kidnapped in northern Syria nearly two years ago while covering the civil war in Syria.

In Britain Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a family vacation and returned to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria, amid indications that a British citizen was involved in Foley’s killing. In the video, his masked executioner speaks in English with what sounds like a British accent.

After beheading Foley, the executioner is pictured with a second captive, identified as U.S. freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff, who disappeared last year in Syria. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the executioner says.

In an interview with the BBC, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine. Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.

“We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,” Hammond said. “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.”

A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it to the speech of former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.

Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.

Foley, 40, was working in Syria for the Boston-based news Web site Global­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012.

In a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom, Foley’s mother wrote: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim,” Diane Foley wrote. “He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.

“We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”

Praising James Foley as “an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,” she asked that the family’s privacy be respected.

In addition to Foley and Sotloff, at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria, according to a 2013 Global­Post article, including Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012. No one has claimed to be holding them.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 66 journalists, all but 10 of them Syrian, have been killed covering the Syrian war. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al-Qaeda.

The Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq.

As the group has grown, it has merged with the group formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. According to U.S. intelligence, it numbers in the thousands, including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States.

In April, Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq, taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad. Extensive reports of executions, including beheadings and crucifixions, have emerged from areas under the group’s control.

This month, amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution, the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq.

On Aug. 7, Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad. On Monday, after a total of 68 strikes from jets, bombers and drones, Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with U.S. air support, had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil.

Within hours of that announcement, the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans “in any place” in response to the airstrikes. “We will drown all of you in blood,” it said.

The title of the video posted Tuesday was “A Message to America” and was produced by the Islamic State’s media arm, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist Web sites.

A masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back. “Obama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims,” the masked man says.

The video then shows a clip of Obama’s Aug. 7 announcement, followed by a statement from the prisoner.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” he says. He asks his parents not to accept “any meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in Iraq.”

The prisoner also appeals to “my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force,” to “think about what you are doing.”

“I wish I had more time,” he says. “I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t an American.”

The masked man then identifies the prisoner as “James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.” He then reaches down with a large knife and begins the apparent beheading of the prisoner; the screen fades to black and the next image is of a body with a head placed upon its back.

The masked man then appears with another prisoner, identified as Sotloff, in a similar kneeling position.

Foley reported from some of the most dangerous recent crises and was imprisoned for 44 days in Libya in 2011 by forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gaddafi. According to Global­Post, two eyewitnesses saw his interception by a group of armed men in a silver-colored van on a road near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012.

Since then, Global­Post “has mounted an extensive international investigation . . . to determine who kidnapped Foley and where he was being held,” Global­Post said in an article on its Web site late Tuesday.

617,Experts: More facts needed on purported audio recording of Michael Brown shooting,"A new rumor making the rounds today claims that on a recent trip to Germany Apple CEO Tim Cook was overheard telling a retail employee that the waterproofing of the Apple Watch has improved since it was unveiled last year, apparently it can even be worn in the shower, when this device was shown off for the first time the company didn’t say if it was waterproof enough to be worn while swimming or taking a shower.
The rumor from iGen.fr claims that Cook was speaking to employees at a retail store in Berlin where he told them that the wears his Apple Watch everywhere, “even in the shower.”
It should be kept in mind though that when the Apple Watch was unveiled last year the company had only said that the device was good for wearing in the rain, getting sweaty during a workout and washing hands. There was no mention of showers or swimming pools.
While it is possible that Apple has tweaked the watch enough that its now good for those tasks as well, one can’t discount the possibility that Cook might simply have been misheard, so we’ll really have to wait until the device arrives to find out just how resistant it is to water.
The Apple Watch will start shipping to customers in April.

A report published on the website of CCTV, a state broadcaster, offered readers practical advice on the selection of their Western-style name, a rite of passage for most young Chinese.

“Take heed,” the article said. “English names come with different connotations…A name can come with a 'feeling’ or idea about what sort of person you are.”

Names “with a distinct feeling of Britishness” such as Elizabeth, William and Catherine were considered as “safe” by the article, which was illustrated with a picture of the Royal family.

But other, less desirable name types were also listed, such as those derived from “suggestive” foods such as Candy, Lolly and Sugar which were “typically thought of as 'non-smart girl’ names, or 'stripper’ names.”

Picking the distinctive name of a world leader of celebrity such as Obama or Madonna, or that of a religious figure (“Satan”), was not advised.

You might want to sit down.

According to insiders, the pesky rodents have invaded the infamous accessories closet and made their presence known by leaving droppings on desks, computers, and pricey couture! ... “The famed accessories closet, which was being put together with the designer wares from the old office, was taking shape when the rats got into it,” the source revealed. “There were droppings all over the floor, and some of the shoe boxes had been chewed into.”

People, meanwhile, suggested that the magazine’s employees are literally surrounded by rat droppings:

“It’s true,” an insider confirms to PEOPLE. “The girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It’s nasty.”

How did the rodents penetrate the fashion bible’s new office? Radar confirmed what we’ve heard from at least one other source: The rats let themselves in via 1WTC’s ventilation system:

“The rats appear to have gotten in via the venting, which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in,” the source explained. “Walls were being moved to accommodate last-minute design changes by Anna and Condé Nast, and it’s assumed this is how the rats got in.”

625,"Rumor: Stainless Steel Apple Watch Will Cost $500, Gold $4,000","Apple apparently wanted its smartwatches to focus heavily on health-related features, but the company was forced to changed direction mid-development. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company originally envisioned a device that can monitor heart rate, blood pressure and stress levels (based on the conductivity of the skin). Unfortunately, the sensors they tested just didn't pass muster, which isn't entirely surprising, since we've reviewed plenty of wearables with patchy heart rate monitors in the past. The company's engineers found that hairy arms, dry skin and even how tightly the watch is worn can affect the results, and they didn't find a solution in time.

Apple Watch became known as a black hole within the company, the WSJ's sources said, as it continued sucking in resources for four years despite all the failures during testing. Its development slowed down once the company realized that a health-focused watch that meets its standards will be very hard to build at this time. The lineup of watches due out in April are a lot different from the original one Apple envisioned and are more of an iPhone companion with a much simpler pulse monitor and pedometer.

Still, the company's expecting to sell a ton, reportedly ordering around 6 million units from its Asian suppliers just for the first quarter. Half of those are the entry-level Apple Watch Sports, while the mid-tier stainless steel model makes up a third of that number. As for Cupertino's original vision, well, there's always a chance that we'll see it come to life in the coming years. The company has a good track record of substantially improving its devices after a debut model appears -- the first iPhone didn't have 3G.

626,Guantanamo detainee freed in Bowe Bergdahl swap 'back to terrorism',"Those caught with the same moniker as the dictator would apparently have to be ""trained"" to change it

North Korean citizens hoping to name themselves after Kim Jong-Un in the near future are out of luck, because the leader has banned the use of his moniker, and ordered those who already have it to be “trained” to change it.

According to the Daily Mail, South Korean television obtained a leaked internal document from the state that included an “administrative order” to army, police and government officials to establish the new legislation.

“All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-Un... and train them to voluntarily change their names,” it reportedly reads.

Those caught with the name Kim Jong-Un, it continued, would have their identity cards, school diplomas and official documents briskly adjusted.

Birth certificates baring the dictator’s name would also be rejected.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip... regarding this project,” the Mail further quotes the document as reading.

A spokesperson from the North Korean Embassy in London declined to comment on the authenticity of the report.

However, a South Korean official claimed that the two previous presidents of the secret state, Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, similarly banned the sharing of their names.

“There is a possibility that it would continue to do so now,” he added.

The document was first obtained by Park Jin-Hee, a North Korean defector working for the KBS, who left the state in 2008.

“There is no one in the North named Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-Un,” she said.

The report comes amid speculation that Kim Jong-Un has banned his aides and officials from smoking foreign cigarettes because they are unpatriotic.",unrelated

An internal state document obtained by South Korea’s KBS TV station contains an “administrative order” from then leader Kim Jong-il for all party, army and police officials to ensure the directive was carried out. The order was issued in January 2011, shortly after Kim Jong-un had been anointed as his father’s successor. Kim Jong-il died in December of the same year.

“All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-un … and train them to voluntarily change their names,” said the document, extracts of which were aired by KBS on Tuesday.

The process involved revising names on official documents, including social security cards and school diplomas. Officials were also directed to reject birth certificates for any newborns named Kim Jong-un.

The authenticity of the official directive could not be independently verified, and Seoul’s unification ministry declined to comment on whether it was genuine.

But one government official noted that the Pyongyang regime was known to have banned citizens sharing the names of founding president Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il.

“Given the North maintained the policy under the two previous leaders, there is a possibility that it would continue to do so now,” the official said.

629,Web of confusion as scientists cast doubt on man's claims that a spider burrowed into his stomach through his SCAR,"Angry locals came to the teenager's aid after hearing her scream, before then dragging the man to a butchers shop

An Indian man accused of trying to rape a teenager reportedly had his penis lopped off by vigilante locals after they allegedly heard the girl’s screams.

Suresh Kumar, 40, is now recovering in hospital after he was apparently dragged into a butchers shop in the city of Ganganagar, in India’s Rajasthan state.

He had allegedly been seen pinning the petrified girl to a wall, which is when he was pulled off and taken to a store to have his genitals hacked off with a meat cleaver.

The appendage was reportedly thrown into the road, with officers now hunting down the perpetrators. He is understood to be in a critical condition, while the girl was treat for shock.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, a local, said: “No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime,” according to the Daily Mirror.

He added: “We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped.

“This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.”

The Daily Mail reports a police spokesperson as saying: “As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.

“We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.”

The Indian government has been accused of not doing enough to protect its citizens, as violent attacks against girls and women become increasingly condemned by the international community.

Meenakshi Ganguly , South Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, wrote in the Hindustan Times in August that “knee-jerk solutions like death penalty for rapists and lowering the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16 will not help end sexual violence against women.”

She added: “Instead of hasty measures, the government should make a commitment to effective law enforcement and the more difficult and lengthy steps needed to reform the criminal justice system.”

The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.

It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.

A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses.

The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.

The image was uploaded by Reddit user fryd_ on Saturday morning. He spoke to BuzzFeed News about it:

I came across the pamphlet whilst playing Lego with my niece & nephew at their Grandma’s house and it struck me as particularly modern message for something written 40 years ago. I thought the toy-makers of today could learn a thing or two!

""I know that at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,"" Hunter claimed. ""There's nobody talking about it.""

""If they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,"" he continued.

One source close to Hunter worked to walk back the comment, emphasizing that the congressman received a tip from a “high level” source at U.S. Customs and Border Protection who told him that a group of people with “suspected ISIS affiliation” –- even Americans who traveled to Syria to fight with the Free Syrian Army against President Bashar al-Assad –- were apprehended at the border.

The tip ""was from a confidential source with the Border Patrol,"" the source said in an email. ""[It’s] more accurate to say people with known associations. Not 'fighters' in the sense folks might immediately think.""

While DHS and several other congressional sources shot down the claim outright, a spokesman for Hunter said that the congressman fears ISIS sympathizers could easily melt into U.S. cities and breed home-grown terrorism.

“The Congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,” Joe Kasper, deputy chief of staff to Hunter, wrote in response to the DHS denial. “It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

Customs and Border Protection is part of DHS.

Hunter’s office declined an ABC News request to interview the congressman.

632,A Predator Drone Has Reportedly Been Spotted Circling Above ISIS's Capital City,"UTAH COUNTY — Over the years, holiday office Christmas parties have gained a reputation for crazy antics. Often, there's a lot of heavy drinking. One overly zealous drinker in Utah County nearly killed himself a couple of weeks ago, winding up in the hospital for three days.

Even though the drinks at the party contained no alcohol, a heavy drink nearly put Ryan Roche out of commission for the holidays.

""I think it was one of those spur of the moment kind of things,"" Roche said.

As his holiday office party wound down earlier this month, Roche headed for the door with his wife and kids.

""They busted out some eggnog.""

An eggnog-chugging contest was getting started, and one of Roche's colleagues called him out to compete. Roche said he's a competitive guy and couldn't walk away.

""I've already decided, if I'm going to do it, I'm going to win,"" he said.

The record at that point was 22 seconds. There was a Ruth's Chris Steak House gift card on the line, so Roche faced off against two other co-workers.

""I just opened up my throat, didn't even swallow,"" he said. ""I pretty much poured it down.""

I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably. I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.
–Ryan Roche
As the video shows, he drank a quart of eggnog in just 12 seconds, without taking a breath.

""I got done, and I was gasping, I couldn't breathe.""

Roche said he was coughing a lot as he headed home, but thought he would be OK. A couple of hours later, he wasn't so sure.

""I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably,"" he said. ""I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.""

He asked a friend in medical school to come over to his house and check on him. The friend took him to the hospital.

Roche had aspirated the eggnog to his lungs and was essentially ""dry drowning,"" the doctors told him.

""They pretty much had to wheelchair me in, double IV, oxygen, and hooked me up to what they call the nuclear weapon of antibiotics,"" he said.

The liquid in his lungs was starting an infection. He spent 24 hours in intensive care with a fever, sweats and chills.

""It was rough,"" he said. ""Eggnog: not ideal for the lungs.""

On day three in the hospital, doctors took him off oxygen, and he went home. After about a week, he was back at full strength.

It was a holiday mishap he'll never forget, and also probably never live down. Roche did win, but at quite a price.

636,"Explosion reported near the Nicaraguan capital attributed to meteorite impact, but experts, including NASA, cast doubt on claims","(Update: The story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts.) News has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near Managua, Nicaragua late Saturday night, just 13 hours or so before the close flyby of 20-m asteroid 2014 RC, leading some to suggest that the two events are related. However, according to experts who have been examining the evidence, including those at NASA, the two events are completely unrelated, and the explosion in Managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space.

According to the Nicaraguan news site el19digital.com, an explosion occurred around 11:05 p.m. Saturday night, in the city of Managua, which apparently produced a crater that was over 12 metres (39 feet) wide and about 1.5 metres (5 feet) deep, in a wooded area just to the west of the city's international airport, and just south of the Pan-American Highway.

The video below, from RT.com, shows military personnel investigating the crater, as well as the surrounding area, for potential debris from the explosion.
While the incident is still being investigated, officials with Nicaragua's Institute of Territorial Studies (INET), which monitors earthquake activity in the country, said that the event showed up on the agency's seismic instruments.

""We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact,"" Wilfried Strauch from INET said in a press conference, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). ""You can see two waves: first, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth, and then another stronger one, which is the impact of the sound.""

However, while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion, the scientists have the seismic data from it, and they have the resulting crater, there are parts of the story that just don't add up.

A 20-metre wide asteroid named 2014 RC passed by Earth on Sunday, flying underneath the planet (from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere), and while there is roughly a 13-hour difference in the timing of these two events, some saw a potential connection between these events. It's not entirely unreasonable to suggest this. There are over 11,000 known near-Earth asteroids flying around the Sun, and very likely millions that we haven't detected (and likely won't, because they're too small). While most of these follow their own path as they circle the Sun, not all are alone. Some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them. Some are best described as 'rubble piles', which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulder-like shape by their mutual gravity. Others can be travelling along in 'packs' with some members preceding or lagging behind the 'pack leader' - possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point. So, if one of these asteroid 'packs' is flying by, or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit, it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground.

However, just because two events - an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact - happen close to one another, doesn't mean that they are related. We saw this back in mid-February 2013, when we were watching asteroid 2012 DA14 sweep by Earth and suddenly a 20-m wide asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia. The exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence. 

According to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Near Earth Object Office, that appears to be the case for this event:
A meteorite without the meteor?

An interesting fact about this supposed 'impact' is that, although the explosion was heard throughout the area, apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it. When a meteoroid enters the atmosphere, even if it is just a speck of dust, it is traveling so fast (typically around 17 kilometres per second or over 60,000 km/h) that it heats up the air in front of it, causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor. Larger objects cause even brighter flashes, earning them the name fireball,or even bolide (for an exceptionally large and bright one). Some of these are so bright that they can, very briefly, turn night into day as they pass overhead.

Given the weather over Managua on Saturday night (scattered clouds and calm winds), it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky, especially when it happened near a city of over 2 million people.

According to the Associated Press, Strauch said it was ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""

Was it something else?

This lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story. While nearly all meteorites go through a 'dark flight' phase during the final part of their journey to Earth's surface - after it has slowed down enough that it isn't compressing the air enough to cause it to glow - their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere, some 20 to 30 kilometres above the ground, making them visible far and wide across the countryside.

Geoff Nodkin, professional meteorite hunter and host of Science Channel's Meteorite Men, tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic:
Notkin further commented that if it was meteorite-related, he would expect there to be a very bright fireball, sonic booms during the object's dark flight and then the impact. He also said that, to produce a crater like the one seen, it would have to be an iron meteorite, as they are the densest and ""have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on Earth""

In an interview with National Geographic, Donald Yeomans, the author of Near-Earth Objects: Finding Them Before They Find Us, said: ""There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion, so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact.""

So, what was this, if it wasn't a meteorite? One very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion, as there are still thousandsIn cas buried throughout the country, remnants of the war fought there in the 1980s.

While this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time, it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day, as tons of material is swept up by Earth as the planet orbits the Sun. Many of these are missed because they occur during the day, or over regions of the planet that aren't heavily populated. Some countries have all-sky camera networks to capture these events, with data being reported on sites like SpaceWeather.com (U.S.) and the University of Western Ontario (Canada). As an example, there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in Managua, but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the Atlantic Ocean, over eastern Spain, as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video (note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one):",agree

641,Report claims Kim Jong-un underwent surgery to repair fractured ankles,"Kim Jong-un has broken both of his ankles and is now in the hospital after undergoing surgery, a report in a South Korean newspaper claims.

The North Korean leader has been missing for more than three weeks, fueling speculation about what could cause his unusual disappearance from the public eye. Some rumors indicated that he was suffering from gout, others speculated it was a sign of some sort of internal struggle within the secretive North Korean regime, and some even said he was simply getting ill by eating too much Swiss cheese.

But on Tuesday, South Korean newspaper The Chosun Ilbo added a new twist, reporting that Kim was hospitalized in mid-September and had surgery at the Bonghwa Clinic, a hospital for high-ranking government officials in the capital, Pyongyang.

""I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,"" an anonymous source was quoted as saying.

Apparently, Kim sprained his right ankle while wearing Cuban heels during a tour of military bases and factories, the paper reported. Kim was seen limping in July during a TV appearance.

The paper said that Kim was still in the hospital, under heavy protection from bodyguards, and was receiving visits from several government officials.

This rumor seems to confirm what North Korean state media had said on Thursday, when state broadcaster Korean Central Television reported that Kim was ""not feeling well,"" and was suffering from an ""uncomfortable physical condition.""

However, a recent report reveals the true identity of the YouTube hit and the identity is somewhat shocking. A former Brazilian porn star is behind the wholesome Disney videos and it is noted that during the early years of “Disney Collector,” the woman was filming both Disney unboxing videos and porn in the same Florida home.

The Daily Mail reports that Brazilian Daiane DeJeus, also known as Sandy Summers in the porn industry, is the woman behind the hit Disney Collector Youtube videos. Reporters tracked down information on DeJeus that aligns with public records information regarding the widely popular DC Toy Collector YouTube channel. After tracking down DeJeus, the reporters spoke with family and friends who confirmed that Daiane was behind the million dollar videos.

DeJeus has went to unfathomable measures to ensure her identity remained secret and for good reason. The target market of the YouTube channel, which caters to Disney lovers such as children and families, may not remain viewers if they knew the owner’s secret. DeJeus was not only a Disney fanatic, but also a porn star. Going by the name Sandy Summers, Dejeus filmed numerous x-rated videos for the adult film industry in the same home that she filmed some of her early DC Toy Collector features.

Family and friends have identified DeJeus as the mystery unboxer and note that certain physical features on the woman’s hands and arms can be seen in many of the YouTube videos.

“They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.”

Aside from the physical similarities, former neighbors say DeJeus has an unmistakable voice and say that many people on the street knew what she was up to.

‘That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere. Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.”

646,"No, Saudi TV Didn't Blur Out Michelle Obama's Face When the President Met King Salman","A small furor has erupted over whether a Saudi television station blurred out the image of U.S. first lady Michelle Obama in the broadcast of her and President Barack Obama’s meeting with new Saudi King Salman today in Riyadh. Saudi officials deny the claim.

The new king shook hands with President Obama at the Erga Palace but didn’t acknowledge the first lady during a brief meeting at the funeral for King Abdullah. Barack and Michelle Obama cut short their trip to India to attend the funeral.  

Several videos posted on Saudis' Facebook pages obscured Michelle Obama's face. They were removed shortly after they were posted. I captured a screenshot of one such video before it was taken down. The Arab news service Mashahead posted on YouTube a video allegedly taken from the Saudi government television broadcast showing the blurred spot.

However,  Nail al-Jubeir, information director at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, e-mailed me that ""Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred."" CNN's Hala Gorani tweeted that her colleague Nic Robertson, in Riyadh, saw non-blurred images on Saudi TV. Other news organizations, such as Al Jazeera, showed the meeting without obscuring Michelle Obama’s face.


 

The alleged blurring wasn't the only controversy.  Some Arab media outlets criticized Michelle Obama for wearing a blue dress, rather than a black one. Videos of the short meeting between Salman and President Obama showed the king leaving in the middle of the protocol, abruptly turning around and walking away, in order to go to prayer.

After the meeting, Barack Obama and Salman held a bilateral meeting that included Secretary of State John Kerry, Senator John McCain, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Ambassador Joseph Westphal and CIA director John Brennan.

According to the White House pool report, “Obama and Salman sat in gold chairs. A small table in front of them held a spray of white flowers.”

Obama praised the late king in a statement following his death, saying “King Abdullah's vision was dedicated to the education of his people and to greater engagement with the world.” In an interview with CNN before the visit, Obama explained why he was hesitant to press the new king about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, which includes restricting the rights of women.

""Sometimes we have to balance our need to speak to them about human rights issues with immediate concerns that we have in terms of countering terrorism or dealing with regional stability,"" Obama said.

CATHOLIC PRIEST WHO DIED FOR 48 MINUTES CLAIMS THAT GOD IS A WOMAN

February 4th, 2015 | by Barbara Johnson

Boston| A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

Priest who died for 48 minutes says he met God and she’s a woman

We’ve all seen the traditional depictions of God as a cloud-dwelling figure with a flowing mane and a white beard.

But now, a Catholic priest in America has apparently claimed that God is female, after he officially died for 48 minutes following a massive heart attack.

According to an unverified report, Father John Micheal O’Neal, 71, briefly went to heaven and met a ‘warm and comforting’ motherly figure as doctors battled to save his life at Massachusetts General Hospital.


Analysis: Pure fiction. There is no ""Father John Michael O'Neal"" in the Archdiocese of Boston. So says a spokesperson for the Archbishop himself, Cardinal Sean P. O'Malley.

""I believe this could be a hoax story,"" the spokesperson told a writer for the website Metro.co.uk, which had earlier repeated the false story above without verification. The initial report was also duplicated uncritically on dozens of other blogs and websites.

It wouldn't have been difficult to debunk the story when it first appeared, if anyone had cared to do so. It originated on the satirical website World News Daily Report, after all, which states on its disclaimer page:

All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.

Not only does it revolve around a priest who doesn't exist, the story further claims that Archbishop O'Malley, a real official of the Church, issued a public disavowal of the priest's alleged statements. There is no public record of such a disavowal.

Among the preposterous items that have appeared on World News Daily Report over the past year or so are ""news stories"" claiming that a 600-pound woman gave birth to a 40-pound baby, a Japanese whaling crew was eaten alive by killer whales, and a Chinese miner found alive after being trapped underground for 17 years.",unrelated

Suresh Kumar, 40, was set upon when locals in the city of Ganganagar in India’s north-western Rajasthan state heard a girl’s screams.

A mob dragged Kumar away after he was found in an alley allegedly pinning his victim to a wall – and then the group held a vigilante community meeting to decide what to do with him.

He was beaten with sticks for an hour, and dragged into a local butcher’s shop where his organ was severed with a meat cleaver.

It was thrown into the street.

Kumar is still in a critical condition after the attack.

Local man Aamir Dhawan, 30, said: ‘No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime.’

652,US drones hunt Isis leader in Syria,"Although the majority of Austrian resorts are suffering from a lack of snow there is one where it is business as usual – thanks to the fact that they stored snow from last year.

Resort managers in Saalbach-Hinterglemm in the state of Salzburg say their planned opening is going head as expected thanks to the fact that they saved up tons of snow from last year which they have now put back on the slopes.

Austria is one of the world's most popular skiing destinations and any delay in the usual season start at the beginning of December costs the industry millions.

But while most resorts in the Austrian Alps are currently struggling with an almost total lack of snow, including Flachau in Salzburg and Rosskopf mountain in Tyrol, at a time when the snow is usually plentiful, Saalbach-Hinterglemm has no such problems.

A recent Austrian climate report found the country’s temperatures had risen twice as fast as the global average since 1880, with the number of sunshine hours in the Alps increasing by 20 percent.

And although many resorts have shifted their focus to adaptation solutions, acknowledging that climate change will not be stopped or turned around any time soon, it is the ski resort at Saalbach-Hinterglemm that really planned ahead with the most success.

For the seventh year running the Snow Mobile event will be taking place in Saalbach-Hinterglemm as planned thanks to the snow that was carefully stored since March.

The resort management collected around 13,000-square-metres of snow from the mountains earlier in the year and then stored it by covering it with an artificial fleece and wood chips to keep it cool and prevent it from melting.

A spokesman for the resort said: ""We made sure the covering was airtight, and it paid off. We estimate we have lost about 15 percent of the snow that we put away which is pretty good going given that it's been such a warm year.""

The snow is currently being spread and flattened to allow the event at the weekend to go ahead as planned. Around 22,000 people are expected to turn up to watch.",unrelated

The current MacBook Air’s taper toward the front edge, which gives them a very slim profile, but there’s still space near the back for the power connector and full-sized USBs. The new Air, however, won’t be thick enough for a USB port. Instead, Apple will start using the new type-c reversible connectors. There also won’t be an SD card slot or a MagSafe power connector–even Apple’s beloved Thunderbolt is taking a hike. USB will do it all.

The 12-inch laptop would be substantially smaller and lighter than the 13-inch model, and even slightly smaller than the 11-inch version. This is thanks to slimmer bezels and a slightly more compact keyboard with less separate between keys. 9to5Mac doesn’t have details on exactly how high the resolution will be, but the current Airs are sitting at 1366 x 768 (11-inch) and 1440 x 900 (13-inch). Stepping it up to a Retina Display resolution of 2560 x 1600 (like the 13-inch Pro) would be amazing in the Air’s form factor.

655,Google Grows With $1.6 Billion in California Office Deals,"DNA tests have confirmed that a daughter and an ex-wife of the head of Isis, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, are indeed being held by Lebanese authorities.

There have been conflicting reports about the identity of the woman, with an Iraqi official denying on Wednesday she was al-Baghdadi's ex wife.

But a Lebanese interior minister confirmed today that the woman and child who were detained about 10 days ago in northern Lebanon travelling with a fake ID are in fact the ex wife and daughter of the terrorist leader.

Islamic State (IS) group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addresses worshippers at a mosque in Mosul, after he established a self-declared caliphate across Iraq and Syria on July 5, 2014

The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi, was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday.

He said DNA tests showed that the girl was Baghdadi's child.

'Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,' he said.

'Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child,' Mashnuq added.

'We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is his (Baghdadi's) daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq,' the minister said.

The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi (pictured), was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday

He gave no details on Dulaimi's nationality, but a security source said she was believed to be Iraqi.

Mashnuq offered no further information about her current husband, although he said investigations showed the woman had ties to extremists in Lebanon.

Dulaimi's children were at a children's care centre while she was being interrogated, he said.

Mashnuq also confirmed the arrest of the wife of Anas Sharkas, a leader in Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front.

Dulaimi was among a group of female prisoners released from Syrian jails in March, in exchange for 13 nuns from the ancient town of Maalula held by Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front.

The Islamic State (IS) group has yet to comment publicly on Dulaimi's detention, but Al-Nusra, despite a feud with Baghdadi's group, issued a statement of condemnation.

It described her as 'sister Saja al-Dulaimi' and said the arrest of women and children was evidence of the 'weakness' of the Lebanese state.

Sources said the detention of Dulaimi and Sharkas's wife could help the Lebanese as they struggle to negotiate the release of 27 members of the security forces held by jihadists from IS and Al-Nusra.

The soldiers and police were abducted when militants from the two groups briefly overran the Lebanese border town of Arsal in August.

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said on Sunday that a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a ""relatively small"" meteorite that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth"".

Murillo said Nicaragua would ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.

The crater left by the meteorite has a radius of 12 metres and is 5 metres deep, said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it was still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.

Humberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Centre at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet on Saturday night.

660,Jihadi John UNMASKED: Islamic State killer NAMED as west Londoner Mohammed Emwazi,"THE ISLAMIC State murderer dubbed 'Jihadi John' has been named as Mohammed Emwazi from west London, according to reports.

It is understood that he was known to British security services who chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons.

A close friend of Emwazi told the Washington Post: “I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John.

""He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him.""

Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services.

Asked if David Cameron was concerned about Emwazi's name being reported, a No 10 spokeswoman said: ""The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.

""There is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep British people safe.""

Kuwaiti-born Emwazi is believed to have been raised in a middle-class area of west London, at times attending a mosque in Greenwich.

He is understood to have graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Westminster, after which he started to become radicalised.

The Post claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day.

It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates.

He is thought to have travelled to Syria in 2012, before joining IS (also known as Isis or Isil), according to the Post.

According to the BBC's Dominic Casciani, Emwazi was a ""person of interest"" to British security services from at least 2011.

He apparently featured in ""semi-secret court cases relating to extremism overseas and back in the UK"".

He is thought to have been responsible for the brutal executions of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, American aid worker Peter Kassig, British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines and Japanese hostages Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa.

Each killing was publicised in a series of highly-produced video clips.

The masked executioner appeared to speak with a British accent, prompting speculation about his identity.

The killer gained his moniker after being nicknamed 'John' by a group of his hostages.

He was apparently part of a terrorist cell described as 'the Beatles', with other members known as 'George', 'Paul' and 'Ringo'.

Commander Richard Walton of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) said:

""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

661,Attorney: New audio reveals pause in gunfire when Michael Brown was shot,"On Monday evening’s CNN Tonight, host Don Lemon debuted a recording that allegedly contains audio of the gunshots that killed 18-year-old Michael Brown earlier this month.

On August 9, police officer Darren Wilson shot Brown at least six times during an incident in Ferguson, Mo. Several witnesses claim the young man was fleeing the officer, and had his hands in the air when the fatal shot was delivered; but police officials claim Brown had violently attacked Wilson who then responded in self-defense.

An unidentified man claims to have recorded the gunfire — haphazardly, it seems, as he is heard talking about unrelated matters. At least 10 gunshots can be heard in the background, with a brief pause between the first seven and the last four or so.

Before airing the audio, Lemon cautioned his audience: “CNN cannot independent verify the authenticity of this tape. [We have] reached out to the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the Ferguson resident who says he made the recording.”

663,Small Meteorite Hits Managua,"UTAH COUNTY — Over the years, holiday office Christmas parties have gained a reputation for crazy antics. Often, there's a lot of heavy drinking. One overly zealous drinker in Utah County nearly killed himself a couple of weeks ago, winding up in the hospital for three days.

Even though the drinks at the party contained no alcohol, a heavy drink nearly put Ryan Roche out of commission for the holidays.

""I think it was one of those spur of the moment kind of things,"" Roche said.

As his holiday office party wound down earlier this month, Roche headed for the door with his wife and kids.

""They busted out some eggnog.""

An eggnog-chugging contest was getting started, and one of Roche's colleagues called him out to compete. Roche said he's a competitive guy and couldn't walk away.

""I've already decided, if I'm going to do it, I'm going to win,"" he said.

The record at that point was 22 seconds. There was a Ruth's Chris Steak House gift card on the line, so Roche faced off against two other co-workers.

""I just opened up my throat, didn't even swallow,"" he said. ""I pretty much poured it down.""

I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably. I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.
–Ryan Roche
As the video shows, he drank a quart of eggnog in just 12 seconds, without taking a breath.

""I got done, and I was gasping, I couldn't breathe.""

Roche said he was coughing a lot as he headed home, but thought he would be OK. A couple of hours later, he wasn't so sure.

""I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably,"" he said. ""I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.""

He asked a friend in medical school to come over to his house and check on him. The friend took him to the hospital.

Roche had aspirated the eggnog to his lungs and was essentially ""dry drowning,"" the doctors told him.

""They pretty much had to wheelchair me in, double IV, oxygen, and hooked me up to what they call the nuclear weapon of antibiotics,"" he said.

The liquid in his lungs was starting an infection. He spent 24 hours in intensive care with a fever, sweats and chills.

""It was rough,"" he said. ""Eggnog: not ideal for the lungs.""

On day three in the hospital, doctors took him off oxygen, and he went home. After about a week, he was back at full strength.

It was a holiday mishap he'll never forget, and also probably never live down. Roche did win, but at quite a price.

Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture.

Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. “People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film” Sutter said.

Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt.",unrelated

The picture was posted online by the Islamic extremist brigade Ansar al-Deen Front, according to a CBS News report. It shows a black pick-up truck with a Mark-1 Plumbing decal on the door and an anti-aircraft gun in the bed.
Mark Oberholtzer, who has owned and operated Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City for the past 32 years, confirmed it was his pickup truck in the picture. He said he no longer owned the vehicle and had no idea how it ended up in Syria.
Oberholtzer said he traded in the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago. He usually takes the decals off his vehicles when he sells them but he left it on this truck with the expectation that AutoNation would remove it.
“They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it,” Oberholtzer said. “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.”
He began receiving calls about the truck and the picture on Monday afternoon, Oberholtzer said. By Tuesday he said his business had received a thousand calls and faxes about the image.
“A few of the people are really ugly,” he said.
Derek Duckett, emergency management coordinator for Texas City, said he was unaware of any threats but was checking with local police to reach out to Mark 1 to see whether it needed assistance.
Oberholtzer said he didn’t know what to do about all the attention he was getting from the picture. He just wanted the public to know that the vehicle was no longer his.

668,Paul Rudd Helped Tackle A Violent Homophobe So That’s Another Reason To Love Him [UPDATE],"It's a common practice around the world to speed up TV shows in order to insert more commercial time. The subtle speeding up can slice a couple of minutes from a 22 minute sitcom with little noticeable difference--and broadcasters can plug in two more minutes of commercials per half hour! It's a last ditch effort, perhaps, to extract money out of a dying media delivery system before streaming obliterates the advertising model. TBS does it with Seinfeld reruns (see below) and worldwide it happens all the time--from the BBC to India.

But is that all there is to it--trying to make more money? Actually many viewers point out that TV shows (and everything else) move faster now in the age of the 6-second Vine. The speeding up actually helps the content itself seem more contemporary. Here's one commenter: ""Honestly, shows move a lot faster now and the sped up version feels a little more updated than the original slower version. But who even watches actual TV anymore? No TV + adblock on 90% of internet = very little advertising = happy me :)""",unrelated

Cupertino has been quiet thus far, but rumors are swirling about a 12-inch MacBook Air refresh, and this isn’t just a spec bump. Apple is reportedly redesigning the iconic laptop to be even thinner with a higher resolution screen.
Sources inside the company who have used the prototype notebook (code named MacBook Stealth) say it will eschew many of the conventional laptop features in the name of advancing design. The current MacBook Air’s taper toward the front edge, which gives them a very slim profile, but there’s still space near the back for the power connector and full-sized USBs. The new Air, however, won’t be thick enough for a USB port. Instead, Apple will start using the new type-c reversible connectors. There also won’t be an SD card slot or a MagSafe power connector–even Apple’s beloved Thunderbolt is taking a hike. USB will do it all.
MBA
The 12-inch laptop would be substantially smaller and lighter than the 13-inch model, and even slightly smaller than the 11-inch version. This is thanks to slimmer bezels and a slightly more compact keyboard with less separate between keys. 9to5Mac doesn’t have details on exactly how high the resolution will be, but the current Airs are sitting at 1366 x 768 (11-inch) and 1440 x 900 (13-inch). Stepping it up to a Retina Display resolution of 2560 x 1600 (like the 13-inch Pro) would be amazing in the Air’s form factor.

To be clear, all the images of this supposed notebook are renders created by 9to5Mac. This is still thoroughly in the rumor category, but it’s a redesign we’ve been expecting for a long time. The updated MacBook Air could be announced in mid-2015.

670,Who Is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau? Ottawa Shooter Suspect Identified By Canadian Officials ,"Those caught with the same moniker as the dictator would apparently have to be ""trained"" to change it

North Korean citizens hoping to name themselves after Kim Jong-Un in the near future are out of luck, because the leader has banned the use of his moniker, and ordered those who already have it to be “trained” to change it.

According to the Daily Mail, South Korean television obtained a leaked internal document from the state that included an “administrative order” to army, police and government officials to establish the new legislation.

“All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-Un... and train them to voluntarily change their names,” it reportedly reads.

Those caught with the name Kim Jong-Un, it continued, would have their identity cards, school diplomas and official documents briskly adjusted.

Birth certificates baring the dictator’s name would also be rejected.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip... regarding this project,” the Mail further quotes the document as reading.

A spokesperson from the North Korean Embassy in London declined to comment on the authenticity of the report.

However, a South Korean official claimed that the two previous presidents of the secret state, Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, similarly banned the sharing of their names.

“There is a possibility that it would continue to do so now,” he added.

The document was first obtained by Park Jin-Hee, a North Korean defector working for the KBS, who left the state in 2008.

“There is no one in the North named Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-Un,” she said.

The report comes amid speculation that Kim Jong-Un has banned his aides and officials from smoking foreign cigarettes because they are unpatriotic.",unrelated

The rumor from iGen.fr claims that Cook was speaking to employees at a retail store in Berlin where he told them that the wears his Apple Watch everywhere, “even in the shower.”
It should be kept in mind though that when the Apple Watch was unveiled last year the company had only said that the device was good for wearing in the rain, getting sweaty during a workout and washing hands. There was no mention of showers or swimming pools.
While it is possible that Apple has tweaked the watch enough that its now good for those tasks as well, one can’t discount the possibility that Cook might simply have been misheard, so we’ll really have to wait until the device arrives to find out just how resistant it is to water.

She said: ""I was walking around feeling miserable and decided to stop off at the KFC at the train station.

""But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar. Then I realised we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left.

""When we asked her if she was ok, she said she was and just needed time to think. And then asked for another box of chicken wings with extra large fries.""

""And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore.""

She then boarded the next train to her parents' home in Quingdao city in east China’s Shandong Province and left.

677,Man Known as ‘Jihadi John’ Is Identified as Mohammed Emwazi,"The ""Jihadi John"" killer who has featured in several Islamic State in Iraq and Syria beheading videos is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a middle class family who grew up in London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming, the Washington Post newspaper said.

In videos released by ISIS, the masked, black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of hostages including Americans and Britons.

The BBC said Emwazi is suspected of appearing in videos that showed the killings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, who also went by Peter.

The black-clad militant also appeared in videos in January 2015 that showed Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, who were later killed.

The Post said Emwazi was believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined ISIS.

""His real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming,"" the Post said.

In each beheading video, he is dressed entirely in black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm.

Hostages gave him the name John as he and other Britons had been nicknamed the Beatles, another was dubbed George.

The paper said he had been born in Kuwait, was raised in a middle-class neighbourhood in London and occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich, southeast London.

Police declined to comment on the reports.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter- terrorism investigation,"" said Commander Richard Walton of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command in a statement.

The Post quoted friends of Emwazi, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as saying they thought he had started to become radicalized after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster in London.

They said Emwazi and two friends - a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib - never made it to the safari. On landing in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight before eventually being deported, they said.

The Islamist group also threatened to kill another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff of World Affairs and Time, stating his fate is in the hands of President Barack Obama.

Foley went missing almost two years ago while covering the conflict in Syria as a freelance photographer. The 39-year-old reporter was working for Agence France-Presse when he disappeared, and his whereabouts were essentially unknown until this recording surfaced.

His November 22nd disappearance was classified as a kidnapping by the FBI, which stated he “was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria.”

In the new video, the militants proclaimed the violent act as “a message to America” for its decision to launch airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq, where it has made rapid territorial conquests over the last few months.

After stating that President Obama’s decision to authorize military action against the extremist group “effectively [placed] America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims,” Foley appears kneeling beside a masked man. He is forced to read a letter which blames the US government for “hammering the final nail into his coffin” before the masked man takes his life.
Sotloff’s life, meanwhile, “depends on Obama’s next decision,” the group claimed. Sotloff has been missing since mid-2013, and his Twitter account indicates his last known location was Libya.

In a statement, the US National Security Council confirmed it had seen the video, but added that it's still working to determine its authenticity.

""If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.

The video’s release comes just one day after militants declared they would attack American targets “in any place” if American airstrikes kill any of their members. Militants said, “we will drown all of you in blood” and flashed images of an American was beheading during the United States’ initial invasion of Iraq.

So far, the Islamic State’s campaign through Iraq has seen numerous reports of beheadings, including those carried out against child victims. The group has regularly threatened Christians and other minorities to either convert to their radical take on Islam or die, and even forced tens of thousands of ethnic Yazidis to flee to Sinjar Mountain with no food or water in order to escape being executed.

The last event triggered renewed military and humanitarian action by the United States earlier this month, and airstrikes have been used to help Kurdish security forces beat back militant fighters from northern Iraq.

682,US Intel: Taliban Man Released From Gitmo in Bergdahl Deal is Back to Militant Activity,"Speculation is mounting that one of the senior Taliban detainees swapped for a US army prisoner of war has returned to militancy, following a leak to CNN.

No US official has yet confirmed the allegation, on or off the record. If true, it stands to plunge the Obama administration back into an acrimonious debate about its prisoner exchange for Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl – and its long-frustrated aim of closing Guantánamo Bay.

CNN reported on Thursday that one of five Taliban members formerly held by the US at Guantánamo may have re-engaged in unspecified terrorist activity. Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the House intelligence committee, said in a statement he “cannot confirm or deny” the report.

Related: US soldier Bowe Bergdahl freed by Taliban in Afghanistan

A representative for the committee, Jack Langer, said classification restrictions would not permit additional detail on whether the Taliban member actually committed a terrorist or militant act, nor which ex-detainee is believed to be the subject of the speculation.

Langer also would not comment on when the committee learned of the allegation against the former detainee, but said that as part of the committee’s oversight responsibilities, it would scrutinize the issue.

So will the Senate armed services committee. “The committee is looking into the details of this issue,” said Dustin Walker, a spokesman, who could not confirm the allegation. He noted that panel chairman Senator John McCain “has expressed concern in the past about the potential for these prisoners to return to the fight”.

Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori, Mohammed Nabi, Khairullah Khairkhwa and Abdul Haq Wasiq, all detained at Guantánamo since the early days of the Afghanistan war, were placed under monitoring of the emir of Qatar in exchange for Bergdahl. They were not returned to Afghanistan, and are not believed to be there now.

The exact terms of the trade, which occurred in late May 2014, have not been disclosed, but the so-called Taliban Five were said to have been required to remain in Qatar for one year. The Obama administration has said from the start that assurances provided by the emir gave the US sufficient visibility into future activities and potential threats from the five men.

Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, said after the deal was finalized that “in all likelihood” the five ex-detainees “will not pose a national security risk”.

According to CNN, intercepted communications from the suspected detainee indicate he has reached out to his Taliban comrades to encourage additional attacks in a war in which the Obama administration has drawn down US forces. Approximately 10,000 US troops remain in Afghanistan, with residual counter-terrorism and training missions but said to be no longer taking part in major combat.

From the start, the Bergdahl swap drew criticism from congressional Republicans. Several contended that releasing the five senior Taliban from Afghanistan was a price too high for Bergdahl, whom the Taliban captured in 2009 following a murky decision Bergdahl apparently made to leave his unit’s base in eastern Afghanistan. House Republicans in particular blasted the US defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, for failing to notify them, as required by law, 30 days before the intended trade, which the administration indicated would have jeopardized the deal.

Related: US army denies reports it has decided to charge Bowe Bergdahl with desertion

While Bergdahl is now assigned to an army base in Texas, the army is investigating whether he should be charged with desertion. This week it batted back media reports that it had decided he would be.

McCain, himself a prisoner of war for five years in Vietnam, has not criticized Bergdahl. But he said when the trade occurred that the senior Taliban were “big, high-level people, possibly responsible for the deaths of thousands”.

Nunes, in his statement, warned that if Obama continued with his intended transfers of detainees from Guantánamo, “there will be a steep price to pay – very likely in American lives”.

On Monday, the former administration envoy for closing Guantánamo underscored Obama’s intention to redouble efforts to shutter the controversial facility before his presidency ends, fulfilling a long-frustrated pledge. Additional transfers are expected in the coming weeks.Cliff Sloan, who left the State Department on 31 December, told the Guardian the administration was prioritizing the transfer of detainees already deemed by six agencies, including the military and intelligence leadership, not to pose significant national security risks.",discuss
683,Kim Jong-Un 'Has Difficulty Walking And Needs About 100 Days To Recuperate',"You want a gold Apple Watch, you say? Then it's going to cost you... a lot. 

The vanilla variant of Apple's newest wrist-worn wearable device only costs $349. However, if you're willing to spend big cash on something that has the Apple logo on it, the company would be more than willing to accommodate. 

According to analyst John Gruber, the gold version of the upcoming device may cost about as much as the monthly salary of a middle-class worker in the United States. Gruber predicts that the gold Apple Watch would cost $5,000. The figure is basically just a guess. However, it's not an uneducated one. 

""Most people think I'm joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000. I couldn't be more serious,"" Gruber wrote in a blog post. ""The lowest conceivable price I could see for the Edition models is $1,999 -- but the gold alone, just as scrap metal, might in fact be worth more than that.""

Gruber claims that Apple told him that the gold version of the Apple Watch is made of solid 18-karat gold. It is not gold-plated. This caused him to revise his guess on the price of the device.  

He based his estimate on the going rate for solid gold watches from other manufacturers. Challenging people to find a solid gold watch that costs less than $20,000, he cited a leaked price list for Rolex from 2012. Luxury watch companies don't set prices for their products; they leave that to their authorized dealers. This means that the products on the price list may have ended up being sold for a higher price. In the list, an 18-karat gold Rolex had a price tag of $34,250.


Gruber suspects that the reason Apple has been mostly silent about the specs for the device is that they don't know what the capabilities of the finished product would be. 

""What does Apple Watch actually do? Or, rather, what does WatchKit allow? We don't know. And Apple is not talking, even off the record. One factor is that the software (and perhaps the hardware internals remain a work in progress). It is far from a finished product,"" he said. 

Aside from the gold version, Gruber also predicts a stainless steel version of the device that costs $999. It's not clear whether fancier variants of the device would be available with the sport version at launch. Nonetheless, the Apple Watch is expected to ship in early 2015.",unrelated

""American soldiers carried away the hostage. He was wounded and we don't know if he is dead or alive,"" the Yemeni official told Agence France-Presse on condition of anonymity.

Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, where he had been working as a freelance photographer for the Yemen Times.

Al-Qaeda posted a video Thursday that showed Somers, 33, and a local al-Qaeda commander threatening that Somers would meet his fate in three days if the United States doesn’t meet the group’s demands, which weren’t specified.

In a video posted Saturday near London, Lucy Somers describes her older brother as a romantic who “always believes the best in people.” She ends with the plea: “Please let him live.”

In a statement, Somers’ father, Michael, calls his son “a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people” and asks for his safe release.

“When foreign nationals were advised to leave Yemen, Luke refused to go, saying he felt safe and at home there,” Lucy Somers said in her video. “He felt the Yemeni people would look after him.”

“Photojournalism has been his way of highlighting the struggles of the Yemeni people,” she said.

Michael Somers said his son “was confident that no one would harm him for his simplicity and honest friendship to all Yemenis around him.”

Luke Somers “told all his friends and loved ones stories of Yemenis’ generosity, humility and devoted friendship,” his father said, adding, “Luke’s life in Yemen these past three and a half years should not have ended with a kidnapping but with a great reward. The fact that he chose to live in Yemen and not the United States shows where his sympathies lay. Please bring Luke back to us safe and sound.”

Somers’ brother, Jordan, and mother, Paula, offered a similar message in an earlier video.

“My life is in danger,” Luke Somers said in the al-Qaiea footage, which appeared to mimic hostage videos released by al-Qaida’s rival, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group. He asked for help.

In a statement Thursday, Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby acknowledged for the first time that a raid last month had sought to rescue Somers but that he turned out not to be at the site.

White House spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan also said President Barack Obama had authorized a rescue operation to free Somers and other hostages but “regrettably, Luke was not present.”

685,Christian Bale in Talks to Star in Sony's Steve Jobs Film,"SEVEN girls, aged 13 to 15, have fallen pregnant after a five-day school trip to their country’s capital city and their parents are being blamed.

The schoolgirls, from the city of Banja Luka, went to the Bosnia and Herzegovina capital, Sarajevo.

Nenad Babici, the National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika, told Inserbia.info that it was discovered that the seven schoolgirls fell pregnant on the school trip.

The school in Banja Luka had taken 28 girls to the nation’s capital city for a five-day trip to visit museums and historic sights in the city, ranked among the finest in the world.

Furious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision, reported the Daily Mail.

However, Babici blamed parents for not educating their children properly.

He said that early engagement in sexual relations later lead to adverse consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.

Senad Mehmedbasic, a Sarajevo gynaecologist, said a growing trend of underage pregnancies in Bosnia and Herzegovina is worrying.

“That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,” he told Inserbia.info.

Educational institutes and parents should, he said, play a stronger role in providing effective sex education.

“It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences.

“We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.”",unrelated

The site's sources, which are often reliable, suggest that the event might take place during the last week of February, potentially on Tuesday, February 24.

The event may see Apple once again showcasing the Apple Watch, which is set to debut in April, and it may also see the launch of the 12-inch MacBook Air. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently predicted that the upcoming notebook will debut in March, which is in line with a late-February unveiling.

Rendering of the 12-inch MacBook Air by Martin Hajek
Apple's 12-inch MacBook Air is rumored to feature a new ultrathin design that does away with fans and introduces a revamped trackpad. It may include a low-power Core-M processor and it may be the first device to take advantage of the new reversible USB Type-C connector, which is much smaller and allows a USB cable to be inserted into a notebook in any orientation.

Apple may also use the event to unveil additional details on the Apple Watch, such as pricing and battery life. An event showing off the Apple Watch could explain why Apple has been asking some developers to have their apps ready to launch in the App Store in mid-February, as we reported last week. It's possible that Apple will use apps from these developers to demonstrate additional capabilities of the watch.

Though rumored, a February event is by no means confirmed at this point, and it is unclear what else Apple might cover in addition to the Apple Watch and the 12-inch MacBook Air.

Update 12:23 PM: Sources speaking to 9to5Mac have indicated Apple will not be holding a late February media event.

688,Who Is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau? Ottawa Shooter Suspect Identified By Canadian Officials ,"Pentagon investigating claims but admits one load missing and it would be embarrassing if it ended up in terror group’s hands

A US airdrop of arms to besieged Kurds in Kobani appears to have missed its target and ended up in the hands of Islamic State (Isis) militants.

Video footage released by Isis shows what appears to be one of its fighters for in desert scrubland with a stack of boxes attached to a parachute. The boxes are opened to show an array of weapons, some rusty, some new. A canister is broken out to reveal a hand grenade.

The Pentagon said it was investigating the claim but admitted that one of its airdrops had gone missing. If confirmed, it would be an embarrassment for the US, given the advanced precision technology available to its air force.

The seemingly bungled airdrop comes against a steady stream of US-supplied weapons being lost to Isis forces, mainly from the dysfunctional Iraqi army. Isis is reported to have stolen seven American M1 Abrams tanks from three Iraqi army bases in Anbar province last week.

The Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral John Kirby, told reporters that analysts at Centcom headquarters in Tampa, Florida, were examining the video. “We’re still taking a look at it and assessing the validity of it,” he said. “So I honestly don’t know if that was one of the one dropped.”

The US began dropping munitions, supplied by Kurdish authorities in the semi-autonomous region of northern Iraq, to their compatriots in Kobani, which sits close to the Iraqi-Turkish border; Isis fighters have encircled much of the town.

Kirby confirmed the weapons shown in the video were the kind that were dropped. “So it’s not out of the realm of the possibility in that regard,” he said.

“I do want to add, though, that we are very confident that the vast majority of the bundles did end up in the right hands. In fact, we’re only aware of one bundle that did not.”

The airdrops were carried out by three C-130 planes. The video shows a man in camouflage clothes and balaclava looking through the boxes of munitions. He says they were dropped by US forces and had been intended for the Kurds. He described them as the spoils of war.

As well as grenades, the boxes appeared to contain parts for rocket-propelled grenades. Some of the equipment appears to be east European in origin, which might seem odd given the weapons were dropped by Americans, but the munitions were supplied by the Kurdish authorities who had been stocking up.

Kirby said the situation in Kobani remained tense, with Kurdish forces in control of most of the city. The US-led coalition has mounted more than 130 air strikes round the town in an effort to stop Isis taking complete control.

While the US has carried out air strikes in Kobani, cloud cover last week prevented them hitting much of the rest of Iraq, particularly around the contested Mosul dam. If the dam was to fall to I, it would provide huge leverage for the group, a strategic loss with potentially catastrophic consequences.

Britain has been supplying the Kurdish semi-autonomous region with weapons but so far supplies have been limited. The Kurds report receiving about 40 heavy machine guns but say they badly need heavier equipment, in particular armoured vehicles.",unrelated

690,Kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls: Government claims ceasefire deal with Boko Haram that will bring missing girls home,"Nigeria's military says it has agreed a ceasefire with Islamist militants Boko Haram - and that the schoolgirls the group has abducted will be released.

Nigeria's chief of defence staff, Alex Badeh, announced the truce. Boko Haram has not made a public statement.

The group has been fighting an insurgency since 2009, with some 2,000 civilians reportedly killed this year.

Boko Haram sparked global outrage six months ago by abducting more than 200 schoolgirls.

The girls were seized in the north-eastern town of Chibok in Borno state, and their continued captivity has led to criticism of the Nigerian government's efforts to secure their release.

Members of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign said in a tweet on Friday: ""We are monitoring the news with huge expectations.""

'Cautiously optimistic'

Air Chief Marshal Badeh revealed the truce at the close of a three-day security meeting between Nigeria and Cameroon. He said Nigerian soldiers would comply with the agreement.

Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told BBC Focus on Africa that the agreement was sealed after a month of negotiations, mediated by Chad.

As part of the talks, a government delegation twice met representatives of the Islamist group.

Mr Tukur said Boko Haram had announced a unilateral ceasefire on Thursday and the government had responded.

""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" he said.

""I am cautiously optimistic.""

He said arrangements for their release would be finalised at another meeting next week in Chad's capital, Ndjamena.

The negotiations are said to have the blessing of Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, reports the BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja.

Speaking to the BBC, Nigerian government spokesman Mike Omeri said Boko Haram would not be given territory under the ceasefire agreement - and that the government would not reveal what concessions it would make.

""We are inching closer to release of all groups in captivity, including the Chibok girls,"" he said.

Analysis: Will Ross, BBC News, Lagos

Nigerian officials had not given any indication that negotiations with Boko Haram were taking place. Even though there had been rumours of talks in neighbouring Chad, this is a very surprising development.

Many Nigerians are extremely sceptical about the announcement especially as there has been no definitive word from the jihadists.

The military has in the past released statements about the conflict in north-east Nigeria that have turned out to be completely at odds with the situation on the ground.

So many here will only celebrate when the violence stops and the hostages are free.

In May 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan imposed a state of emergency in the northern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa, vowing to crush the Islamist insurgency.

But Boko Haram increased its attacks this year.

The group promotes a version of Islam which makes it ""haram"", or forbidden, for Muslims to take part in any political or social activity associated with Western society.

It frequently attacks schools and colleges, which it sees as a symbol of Western culture.

Human Rights Watch has reported that 2,053 civilian were killed in the first half of the year, while Amnesty International estimated that 4,000 people were killed in violence - including Nigerian military operations - in the first seven months of 2014.

Boko Haram is seeking to establish an Islamist state in Nigeria, but its fighters often cross the long and porous border with Cameroon.

Eight Cameroon soldiers and more than 100 Boko Haram militants were killed in fighting in the far north of Cameroon on Friday, Reuters quoted the country's defence ministry as saying.

692,Mexico finds 4 more graves at site of suspected student massacre,"By Benjamin Kang Lim and Tony Munroe BEIJING/SEOUL, Oct 9 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg, a source with access to the secretive North's leadership said on Thursday, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's health and grip on power. North Korea's state media, which usually chronicles Kim's whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on Sept. 3. The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises. ""He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,"" the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. ""He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,"" the source said. Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury. Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified. ""Kim Jong Un is in total control,"" said the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing. Friday is the 69th anniversary of the founding of North Korea's Workers' Party, an event Kim has marked in the past two years with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred. If Kim does not turn up, it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle, experts said. ""The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,"" said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.  NOT KIM'S FIRST ABSENCE North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble. It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view. In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days. He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium. Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fueled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from ""discomfort."" Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang. The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumors of a coup were ""rubbish."" ""It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,"" said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a program for North Koreans in Southeast Asia. North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centered on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye. Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago. However, Kim's name has not disappeared from state propaganda. Thursday's edition of the Workers' Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked ""the Marshal"" for his support during the competition. Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped. ""Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing,"" he said. (Additional reporting by James Pearson; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Raju Gopalakrishnan)",unrelated

A 'feminist' blog from the US has caused outrage after its author apparently admitted aborting her male fetus based on her negative past experiences of men.

In an article so astounding it is difficult to believe it is actually true, 'Lana' even expresses surprise that ""many friends, and several of my own family members have completely cut off communication with me"".

The author purports to have fallen pregnant in 2012 and was overjoyed at the thought until she discovered she was to have a boy at which point she decided to have an abortion.

Read the full blog post here

Abortion based on gender is illegal in the UK but just this week religious groups wrote to MPs to support an amendment to the 1967 Abortion Act to clarify the point.

The amendment reads: ""Nothing in section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 can be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child.""

The practise is said to still happen in the UK particularly in ethnic communities where boys are more valued than girls.

In the blog, Lana details one of the negative experiences that was so terrible she felt she could not ""bring another monster into the world"".

The story begins aboard a plane on the way to an Occupy Wall Street rally in San Francisco. A man sat next to her upon discovering where she is going says: ""B****** like you need to learn their place.""

Lana screams ""assault"" and a male attendant rushes over but refuses to do anything as no physical contact was made.

She then admits considering lying but won't move to one of the only two spare seats as they are ""both back in Economy"".

She adds: ""I was flabbergasted, and then betrayed as they recommended that I move to one of the empty seats. This left me in tears.

""I knew the only way to get away was to move seats so I did so tearfully and having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.""

Lana then goes on how pregnancy made her feel her body had betrayed her so much she experienced ""crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war"".

Her decision to abort the fetus prompted furious comments.

""I almost threw up after reading this.""

""The most disturbing part of this is what if she didn't say yes to finding out the babies gender and had the baby to realize it was a boy, what would she have had done then?""

Fact that people abort kids in western world because of gender is thoroughly sick. ""after learning my fetus was male"" http://t.co/YZCR0UDfBu

695,#HairGate: iPhone 6 Customers Are Complaining That The Phone Is Ripping Out Their Hair,"The Canadian government said on Sunday it was investigating reports that a Canadian-Israeli woman who joined Kurdish militias fighting in northern Syria has been captured by Islamic State (Isis) fighters.

According to a blog linked to Isis, several female fighters who fought alongside the Kurds have been taken prisoner, including Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian-born resident of Tel Aviv. Israel Radio reported Kurdish sources denying the claims, saying Rosenberg was not in the area when it was attacked.

A Canadian government spokesman said in a statement his country was “pursuing all appropriate channels” as it sought further information and was in touch with local authorities.

Asked by an Israeli television station about the reports, the Israeli defence minister, Moshe Ya’alon, said: “I cannot confirm that and I hope that it isn’t true.” The Shin Bet, Israel’s general security service, told the Jerusalem Post: “There are no further details at this stage”.

Rosenberg, 31, joined Kurdish troops fighting Isis earlier this month. A former pilot who served in the Israeli Defence Force (IDF), she reportedly contacted Kurdish fighters over the internet before travelling through Iraq to train at one of their camps on the Syrian border.

In an interview with Israel Radio aired in November, Rosenberg said she was training with Kurdish guerrillas with the intention of fighting in Syria. “They are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really,” she said.

On 20 November, a message posted to a Facebook page in Rosenberg’s name said: “My Facebook account and friend requests are being managed by someone else until I have access again in apx [sic] 2 weeks time on or around week of [8 December]. Please do not message as this is not me. Thank you.”

In a related report by the Inquisitr, it’s claimed that Ian Fleming, the author of the famous James Bond series, helped former President Kennedy to hatch a Fidel Castro assassination plot.

According to the el Nuevo Herald, the rumors claimed Fidel Castro dead because a man named Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of an important politician in Kenya, died over the weekend at the age of 14 years old.

“Castro Odinga was the son of Raila Odinga, the main opposition leader in Kenya and was considered a possible successor to his father. It is possible that his death and his name have confused many users of Twitter, and these have begun to spread the word about the supposed death of the Cuban leader.”

Kenyan police are currently investigating Odinga’s death, and these headlines may have encouraged rumors about the Cuban leader.

According to Laiguana TV, it’s also possible that a blog by Yusnaby Perez may have sparked rumors that claimed Fidel Castro dead because he had not been in public in many months.

“How strange! It is the first year since I can remember the anniversary of the Revolution that Fidel does not appear.”

Thursday marked a year since the former Cuban president made a public appearance. Castro has apparently received foreign dignitaries at his home in Havana, but has not commented publicly on the recent changes between Cuba and the United States that was announced on December 17, 2014.

The rumors were increased even further when Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported on Fidel Castro’s death. The newspaper quickly retracted its report, but not before the alleged “news” about Castro went viral.

Because of these rumors several media outlets in Venezuela and Cuba claimed the Cuban government planned on calling a press conference to discuss Fidel Castro’s heath condition. But an official from the International Press Centre (CPI), the department Cuban Foreign Ministry serving foreign media, says this rumor is false, saying,

“That is false. No press conference was convened, no.”

700,Audio of gunfire in Michael Brown case authenticated by app company,"The man who jumped the White House fence this month and sprinted through the front door made it much farther into the building than previously known, overpowering one Secret Service officer and running through much of the main floor, according to three people familiar with the incident.

An alarm box near the front entrance of the White House designed to alert guards to an intruder had been muted at what officers believed was a request of the usher’s office, said a Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. Officers are trained that, upon learning of an intruder on the grounds, often through the alarm boxes posted around the property, they must immediately lock the front door.

After barreling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first family’s living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.

Gonzalez was tackled by a counter-assault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.

Secret Service officials had earlier said he was quickly detained at the main entry. Agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said the office is not commenting due to an ongoing investigation of the incident.

People jumping over the White House fence has become a more common occurrence, but most individuals are tackled by Secret Services officers guarding the complex before getting even a third of the way across the lawn. Gonzalez is the first person known to have jumped the fence and made it inside the executive mansion.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the breach was “unacceptable” to her, and on Friday she briefed President Obama on her plans to shore up security.

Pierson is expected to face tough questions about the Gonzalez incident Tuesday at a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The hearing is likely to cover a number of security lapses by the agency, including new revelations published over the weekend by The Washington Post about the failure to identify and properly investigate a 2011 shooting attack on the White House.

The more detailed account of this month’s security breach comes from people who provided information about the incident to The Washington Post and whistleblowers who contacted Rep. Jason Chaffetz, (R-Utah), chairman of a House Oversight subcommittee on Homeland Security.

Chaffetz said he plans to ask Pierson how an alarm meant to alert officers to intruders could be silenced or turned down. The congressman said two people inside the agency told him that boxes were silenced because the White House usher staff, whose office is near the front door, complained they were noisy. A Secret Service official told The Post that the usher’s office was concerned the boxes were frequently malfunctioning and unnecessarily sounding off.

The alarm boxes, which officers call “crash boxes,” are key pieces of the agency’s first-alert system, according to former agents and officials. If they spot an intruder, officers are trained to hit the large red button on the nearest box — sending an alert to every post on the complex about the location of an incursion, and piping sound from that location to other boxes around the property.

“If true, the fact that crash boxes were muted to avoid being ‘disruptive’ is not due to a lack of resources or an insufficient number of checkpoints or barriers,” Chaffetz said.

He called the incident a “failure of leadership” by the Secret Service.

“The agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,” Chaffetz said. “It must examine what message is being sent to the men and women who protect the president when their leader sacrifices security to appease superficial concerns of White House ushers.”

The new revelations follow accounts provided to The Post last week detailing how Gonzalez’s ability to enter the White House reflected a failure of multiple levels of security around the compound. The agency relies on these successive layers as a fail-safe for protecting the president and the White House complex.

In this incident, a plainclothes surveillance team was on duty that night outside the fence, meant to spot jumpers and give early warning before they made it over. When that team didn’t notice Gonzalez, there was an officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn. When that officer couldn’t reach Gonzales, there was supposed to be an attack dog, a specialized SWAT team and a guard at the front door — all at the ready.

The dog was not released, a decision now under review. Some people familiar with the incident say the handler likely felt he could not release the dog because so many officers were in pursuit of Gonzalez, and the dog may have attacked them instead.

Since the incident, the Secret Service has added an additional layer of temporary fencing while the agency reviews its procedures.

701,Missing Planes,"U.S. officials suspect that one of the five Taliban detainees released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has attempted to return to terrorism, CNN reported Thursday.

The former prisoner, being held in Qatar, is believed to have tried to make contact with Taliban associates in Afghanistan, officials told CNN.

NBC News reported that it’s unknown whether the man actually connected with the Taliban or if it was a true effort to actually rejoin militants. The name of the former detainee has not been disclosed.

From CNN:

[A]n ongoing U.S. intelligence program to secretly intercept and monitor all of their communications in Qatar turned up evidence in recent months that one of them has “reached out” to try to encourage militant activity, one official said. The official would offer no further details.

Under current law, this act placed the man in the category of being “suspected” of re-engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities. However, several officials say there is now a debate inside the administration that the intelligence may be stronger than the “suspected” classification. Some elements of the intelligence community believe the information is strong enough to classify the man as “confirmed” for returning to illegal activities. All five men are having their communications even more closely monitored right now, but the belief is there is no current threat, one official told CNN.

“We’re closely monitoring the situation and see no potential threat,” an official told NBC.

The prisoner swap, which occurred in May, drew ire from lawmakers who said the Obama administration broke federal law by not first informing Congress.

704,Isis video claims to show beheading of British hostage David Haines,"Islamic State group fighters seized at least one cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town, activists said today.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

A still from an Islamic State (ISIS) video, purportedly shows an IS militant displaying the content of a crate carrying grenades near the town of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey border

A U.S. military airdrop of weapons meant for Kurdish fighters fell into the hands of their jihadist foes near the Syrian battleground town of Kobane, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said

The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

On Tuesday, ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.'

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.

Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'

Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network.

In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place.

Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally.

Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene.

705,Kim Jong-Un planning Scottish restaurant,"She was reportedly arrested as they tried to cross from Syria

A wife and child of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi have been detained by the Lebanese army, security officials have claimed.

The Lebanese army made the arrests as they crossed from Syria ten days ago, Reuters reports.

The woman was described by officials as “one of his wives”, while other reports have described her as his ""ex-wife"".

Al-Rai correspondent Elijah Magnier said a source within the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) had confirmed Saja Dulaimi, Baghdadi's ex-wife and her daughter were arrested in Lebanon.

However, Mr Magnier said another source within the LAF could not confirm she is his ex-wife.

The claims could not be immediately independently verified.   The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir reported the army had detained her in coordination with ""foreign intelligence apparatus"".

It said she had been travelling with a fake passport. Officials did not name or provide the nationality of the woman.

As-Safir said investigators were questioning her at the headquarters of the Lebanese defence ministry.

Charlie Winter, a researcher at the counter-extremism think tank Quilliam, said accounts belong to Isis supporters were denying the reports.

He told The Independent the denials were being circulated with the hashtag “the arrest of the wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is a lie” along with lengthy statements claiming the reports were false.

Isis militants have taken control of swathes of Iraq and Syria since their insurgency began earlier this year. US-led coalition air strikes have targeted the group’s self-declared caliphate but have not yet halted its advance.

Here’s the disclaimer for the site: “Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.”

It had more than 80,000 shares as of Wednesday.

A number of people apparently believed the fake article.

“And Brad Pitt is a bad choice to play John Teller anyway , I’d Choose Sam Elliot,” one person wrote in the comments section.

Added another: “Hope this is fake. Not sure I like Brad Pitt as John Teller. I don’t want to look at the screen and feel it’s another Hollywood movie. Should get lost in the story just like on TV and may not happen when seeing Brad Pitt. Should get a little known actor for the role to create the character rather than buy one.”

Here’s what the original article said:

Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture.

Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. “People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film” Sutter said.

Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt.",unrelated
708,"'American bombing had signed my death certificate': Missing US journalist James Wright Foley goes unflinching to his death as ISIS behead him in horrific video, as a warning to Obama","President Barack Obama denounced Islamic State (Isis) militants for murdering an American journalist in retaliation for US air strikes in Iraq, showing an anger he has rarely displayed in remarks about the Iraq conflict.

“No just god would stand for what they did yesterday and every single day,” Obama said Wednesday in brief remarks from Edgerton, Massachusetts, where he is vacationing.

Hours after US intelligence authenticated a gruesome Isis videotape showing the execution of captive journalist James Foley, an act committed with the goal of deterring future US strikes on Isis, Obama said that Isis “has no place in the 21st century,” and called on allies to help defeat a “cancer so it does not spread.”

Obama did not announce any intensification of his bombing campaign, now in its thirteenth day. US Central Command has yet to announce any new strikes since the Tuesday appearance of the social-media-borne Foley video, although sporadic reports from Iraq have indicated some may have taken place Wednesday.

An emotional Obama ran through a litany of Isis human-rights abuses, from rape to enslavement, calling them “cowardly acts of violence.” In a vague reference to Americans held captive by Isis or near its path in Iraq, Obama said the US would “do everything we can to protect our people,” a formulation that has preceded US military action in the past.

With the death of the first American in Iraq since the US military withdrew in 2011, pressure is mounting on Obama to expand his already growing and amorphous air war against Isis.

The stated purpose of nearly two weeks of bombing has moved from the rescue of mostly Yazidi Iraqi civilians at risk of genocide to providing air cover for Kurdish and Iraqi forces wresting the strategically vital Mosul Dam away from Isis. Aides to Obama pointed out from the start that threats to critical infrastructure would likely prompt a US reprisal.

Buffeted between calls to destroy Isis and criticism of their shifting rationale, Obama and the Pentagon have strenuously objected to a charge of mission creep. They point out the consistency of the goals Obama has articulated since 8 August: preventing humanitarian catastrophe and protecting US personnel in Iraq.

Yet both are broad enough to encompass aerial protection of Iraqi Kurdistan and the destruction of Isis vehicles, artillery and fixed positions from Mount Sinjar to the Mosul Dam. The murder of Foley – delivered after he gave a statement at knifepoint blaming the US for his death – and Isis’s threat to kill another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, is also testing Obama’s goal of safeguarding US nationals in a country overrun by Isis.

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Wednesday that the video showed both Foley and Sotloff.

Leaders from the UK, France and other countries lined up to excoriate Isis for the slaying. British prime minister David Cameron called it “shocking” and cut short his summer holiday to chair meetings on a response. A particularly acute concern for the UK government is the British accent heard from Foley’s masked killer. US intelligence believes hundreds of westerners, including Americans, have joined Isis.

In the UK, Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command, SO15, launched an investigation into the video as leading linguistics experts said the man sounded like he was from London or the south-east of England.

The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said of the video: “All the hallmarks point to it being genuine. We’re very concerned by the apparent fact that the murderer in question is British and we are urgently investigating – agencies on both sides of the Atlantic – are first of all looking to authenticate the video, to make sure that it is genuine, and sadly it appears to be, and then to see if we can identify the individual in question.”

A spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel called Foley’s murder barbaric. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said it exposed Isis as the “caliphate of barbarism”. French president Francois Hollande told Le Monde that a global effort “beyond the traditional debate of intervention or non-intervention” was necessary to confront Isis, and proposed an international meeting next month.

With a brutality so severe it prompted al-Qaida to divorce it from the terrorist franchise, Isis has fulfilled a jihadist aspiration to carve out a state. It flies a flag, sets up internal police to govern its subjects’ adherence to its interpretation of Islamic laws and customs, and maintains financial viability through the control of seized oil assets. While other jihadist entities employ terrorist and insurgent tactics, for which infiltration of another’s populace is central, Isis has mustered a highly mobile army that seizes and holds territory.

Foley’s killer emphasized in a propaganda video that Isis is a state, not a terrorist group, a distinction that is fundamental to the group’s prestige. On Wednesday, Obama repeatedly called Isis “terrorists.”

The Committee to Protect Journalists said the murder of Foley, 40, who went missing during a reporting trip to Syria in 2012, “sickens all decent people”.

“Foley went to Syria to show the plight of the Syrian people, to bear witness to their fight, and in so doing to fight for press freedom,” Sandra Mims Rowe, the group’s chair, said in a statement.

In a Facebook message attributed to her, Foley’s mother Diane said: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.” She also asked the media and the public to respect her family’s privacy.

Obama hailed Foley, who he called Jim, and said he had called Foley’s parents.

Foley’s murder, Obama said, was “an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world.”",agree

Twelve-year-old Nikolai Kryaglyachenko was walking home from school one day when he stopped to lean against a lamppost.

Unfortunately for Nikolai, the lamppost had a faulty wire and the schoolboy was blasted across the street by a jolt of electricity.

“When I came round, I felt groggy, but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened. When I woke up the next day and got out of bed, I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest,” Nikolai revealed.

Being a comic book fan, Nikolai immediately set about testing his new power, which is eerily similar to the power wielded by Marvel character Magneto.

“I can do things I couldn’t do before, but I don’t have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass — it just moved towards me,” he said.

Naturally, Nikolai’s schoolmates were fascinated by his new power, but what they didn’t know was that he could pass his ability to others, turning them into human magnets, too.

“I could even hang a ladle on my nose,” said classmate Vika Balandina.

Nikolai is not the first real-life Magneto. In fact, an entire Russian family got magnetism superpower in 1987.

A year after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, Leonid Tenkaev, his wife, Galina, their daughter Tanya and grandson Kolya were all able to stick metal objects to their bodies, according to The Guardian.

When they discovered their powers, Russian and Japanese scientists examined the family and verified that their seeming magnetism was real.

“There is absolutely no doubt that the objects stick as if their bodies were magnetic,” said Dr. Atusi Kono in 1991.

Islamic State militants on Tuesday released a video that purported to show the beheading of James Foley, an American freelance journalist who has been missing since he was kidnapped in Syria in November 2012.

The authenticity of the video could not be immediately verified.

When contacted by Mashable, NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said, “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

The video opens with a clip of President Barack Obama's remarks announcing the launch of airstrikes on Islamic State positions near Erbil in northern Iraq. A black screen then shows the text, ""A message to America,"" and then Foley appears kneeling in a desert landscape, wearing an orange jumpsuit with a microphone attached. A hooded man wearing all-black clothes and tan military boots is standing behind him with a gun in a leather holster.

""I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,"" Foley says, among other things, in remarks seemingly prepared for him by his captors.

The video then switches to the man in black, who is now holding a serrated knife.

""This is James Wright Foley — an American citizen of your country,"" the man says in British-accented English. ""As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards Islamic State.... Effectively, any aggression towards the Islamic State is an aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership. So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the safety of Muslims living under the safety of the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""

The man then beheads Foley, using the knife as the video fades to black. After a shot of Foley's lifeless body and decapitated head, the video switches to the executioner now standing behind another man in an orange jumpsuit, identified in text on the screen as Steven Joel Sotloff.

""The life of this American prisoner, Obama, depends on your next decision.""

Sotloff, an American freelance journalist who had been working for Time magazine among other publications, was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border on Aug. 4, 2013.

The video then goes black.

The video was first reported by Zaid Benjamin, a reporter for the Arabic-language Radio Sawa, who said that it came from Furqan Media, the official outlet for the Islamic State. (Twitter suspended — then reinstated — the account.)

The video appeared to surface first on the Twitter account @mujahid4life, belonging to someone who described himself in his Twitter bio as 19 years old, ""anti-democracy. Loyal to the Caliphate. Harsh on kuffar. #Revert""

It didn't take long before people who had worked with Foley began reacting on Twitter.

""You know what I think? And I know how crazy this sounds, but we need an #ISISmediaBlackout. Amputate their reach. Pour water on their flame,"" said a Tumblr blogger known as LibyaLiberty on Twitter in what appeared to be the first mention of the hashtag. ""From here on out, I won't share any photo or video of violence intentionally recorded & released by ISIS for propaganda,"" she tweeted. Many others, promptly, joined her pledge.

A statement from a group called Free James Foley said: ""We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.""

""On behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jim’s possible execution first broke. We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic,"" Balboni said.

“Although GlobalPost’s investigation at one point led us to believe that James was being held by the Syrian government, we later were given strong reason to believe he was being held by Islamic rebels in Syria,"" he added. ""We withheld this information at the request of the family and on the advice of authorities cooperating in the effort to protect Jim. GlobalPost, working with a private security company, has amassed an enormous amount of information that has not been made public.”

711,BREAKING NEWS: ISIS beheads missing American journalist James Wright Foley as warning to US to cease action in Iraq,"Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured. Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page. The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story ""mere propaganda"". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible. Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture.

712,Texas plumber's truck on front line of Syria war,"Young North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s health is just fine, his government said Thursday evening, so his sister is probably not running the country. It was said Kim Yo Jong had taken over while her brother underwent medical treatment, but So Se Pyong, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told Reuters Kim was not in bad health.

The ambassador sat down for an interview where he discussed a variety of matters, including North Korea's nuclear program, possibly negotiations to free three detained Americans and, of course, Kim’s health.

It has been rumored Kim, 31, might have had ankle surgery, but So said that is incorrect. The story emerged after Kim did not appear at the Supreme People's Assembly last month and reports said he suffered from ""discomfort.” He was also seen walking with a limp in July. ""That is rumors, fabricated rumors,"" So said about Kim's alleged ailment.

Questions about Kim’s health rose after an article from the Diplomat, a magazine based in Tokyo, claimed his sister was making important government decisions while Kim was being treated at Bonghwa Clinic in North Korea's capital Pyongyang.

""Some say Hwang Byong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo Jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,"" Kim Heung Gwang, the head of North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, reportedly said.

Even if So denies any health problems, Kim has not been seen by his people since Sept. 3. The leader also gained a significant amount of weight, which could contribute to ailments like gout, diabetes or high blood pressure, sources told the Associated Press. If he were suffering from gout, his cheese eating and smoking would worsen the condition.

It is unclear when the attacks took place. ISIS's use of chlorine gas in attacks isn't new. There are reports that the ISIS militants used chlorine-war gas before.

Speaking at a press conference in the Iraqi Parliament on Monday, Ali al-Budairi said: ""ISIS killed 300 out of 400 soldiers they besieged in Saqlawiya district of northern Fallujah, using chlorine gas.""

Al-Budairi held Anbar's operations chief Rashid Falih and new Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi responsible for failing to immediately send army backup to the district.

Paul Ginsberg, an expert on audio forensics, said he heard 10 shots on the recording, first a series of six, then four more.

Blumenthal said the pause between the sixth and seventh shots fired could figure as key evidence into the ongoing investigation of the incident.

“I was very concerned about that pause … because it’s not just the number of gunshots, it’s how they’re fired,” Blumenthal, said the FBI has perused the recordings, told CNN. “And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.”

Brown was fatally shot by police officer Darren Wilson, triggering more than a week of rioting in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, and bringing race relations to the forefront of the country’s consciousness. Wilson’s actions in the deadly incident remain under scrutiny from both a grand jury and federal investigators.

“We’re not anti-police — we respect police,” Sharpton said at the proceedings. “But those police that are wrong need to be dealt with just like those in our community that are wrong need to be dealt with.”

Politicians such as Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill and Rep. William Lacy Clay also were in the pews on the somber day.

716,"RCMP release security footage of Michael Zehaf Bibeau during attack, say he shot soldier in back","Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24, was shot in the chest by a masked gunman, who then rode off in a car

The solider killed today by a masked gunman as he stood guard at the National War Memorial in Ottawa, Canada, has been named locally as Corporal Nathan Cirillo, while a deceased suspect has been identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau.

Cirillo, 24, a reservist with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders within the Canadian Armed Forces, was shot in the chest by the assailant. He was put in an ambulance but latter “succumbed to his injuries”, Ottawa Police said.

The shooter then jumped into a car and sped off, though whether this gunman was behind the shoot-out at the Canadian Parliament minutes later is still unconfirmed. An assailant who entered Parliament was shot dead by sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers.

A Canadian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the dead suspect is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, Associated Press reports, but could not give more details on a possible motive nor details of his background.

However, local reports say that Zehaf-Bibeau was Canadian-born, while Reuters have reported that he was a convert to Islam and was from Quebec.

Earlier today at a press conference following the dramatic incident in Canada’s capital city of Ottawa, Mayor Jim Watson said: “I urge all of my fellow residents to think of the individual standing on guard this morning at the National War Memorial.

“Remember how that one person's life has been taken from us - from family, from friends, from the future that was to be his.”

As reported by CBC News, Cirillo was just one of the guards on duty, who make up of a larger roster of soldiers that rotate on an hourly or bi-hourly basis. They also carry unloaded rifles.

Officials also said that the incident ""caught us surprise"", despite the government upgrading its terror threat from low to medium a day prior due to ""general chatter"" online from jihadist groups including Isis.

An Facebook group in memory of Cirillo has already had over 10,000 followers, with friends and acquaintances of the solider reportedly emailing in their memories of him.

A comment on his profile picture on Facebook reads: “RIP Nathan! Thank you for defending our country, your son is so proud of you. I miss you.”

Student soldiers within the Armed Forces have also reportedly been told not to wear their uniforms, including when on base or inside their cars.

717,Militant Group Says It Killed American Journalist in Syria,"A SCHOOLBOY who was almost killed when he was knocked out by a massive electrical shock claims he now has superpowers like those of Marvel’s Magneto.

Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, 12, from Russia, had been walking home from school when he lent briefly against a lamppost that was electrified from a faulty wire, and was blasted across the pavement.

“When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened.

“When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body,” he said.

“Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.”

He said he was a keen fan of comics and, believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto, decided to put it to the test.

“I can do things I couldn’t do before but I don’t have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things.

“Once I even attracted a glass — it just moved towards me.”

Nikolai added that he has now decided instead of being a fireman he wants to be a superhero when he is older, saying that he would want to do something that helped people.

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his power.

According to his classmates, he can influence others so that other people turn into live magnets as well.

Nikolai’s classmate, Vika Balandina, said: “I could even hang a ladle on my nose.”

718,Guru who ordered 400 followers to be castrated 'so they could be closer to God' is investigated for grievous bodily harm in India,"The North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has not been seen in public for more than a month, leading to rumors his sister has taken over while the Supreme Leader fights an illness or sits under house arrest.

Where is Kim Jong Un?

The saber-rattling North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month, spurring rumors he is ill and leading to speculation over who — if anyone — has filled the power vacuum in Pyongyang.

But there's one atom bomb of a theory being mentioned by Korea watchers that's quickly gaining currency.

Analysts believe 27-year-old Kim Yo Jong, the seventh and youngest of Kim Jong Il's children with four women, has risen rapidly within the regime and may be secretly running the Hermit Kingdom — for now.

Little Kim reportedly went to the same Swiss boarding school with Kim Jong Un and has held positions within the North Korean government since her father was in power.

""If in fact she is running the country — as someone in their early- to mid-20s — to me that is quite alarming,"" Center for Strategic and International Studies analyst Victor Cha told CNN. ""It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.""

State TV showed Kim Jong Un uncharacteristically walking with a noticeable limp in July at the 20th anniversary memorial commemorating the death of his grandfather, the nation's founder.

After the Supreme Leader's recent vanishing act, health theories have abounded. Kim is ill with everything from gout and a cheese addiction to ankle problems and diabetes. State media called what ails Kim ""discomfort"" in a Sept. 26 report.

He may even be under house arrest, according to Remco Breuker, professor of Korean studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

""We're not sure where he is, or what's happening,"" Breuker told the ABC News. ""We don't know whether he's in the hospital or whether he's been put under house arrest.""

Kim Jong Un, whose pal Dennis Rodman said is 31, saw his waistline balloon since he ascended to power in late 2011, analysts note.

Sis Kim Yo Jong is a senior official in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. But her role might have expanded dramatically if Kim Jong Un is incapacitated.

""She is one of the only people in (North Korea) that we know has unfettered direct access to KJU. At the present time I would not be surprised if she is sole gatekeeper,"" North Korea Leadership Watch blog's Michael Madden told NBC News.

Korea watchers point to Friday's anniversary of the founding of the Ruling Workers Party. If Kim Jong Un doesn't show, expect speculation to reach fever pitch.

719,Islamic State claims to have beheaded American journalist,"The recording, allegedly made near the shooting scene, seems to indicate the officer who shot Brown paused briefly in the middle of shooting at least 10 times. CNN aired the tape but cautioned that it could not independently verify whether it was authentic.

A new audio recording surfaced Monday night that allegedly indicates the police officer who shot Michael Brown paused briefly in the middle of unleashing a barrage of at least 10 bullets.

CNN aired the tape but cautioned that it could not independently verify whether it was authentic. It was allegedly filmed near the shooting scene in Ferguson, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis, on Aug. 9.

It was reportedly recorded by a Ferguson resident who could be heard talking with or about a woman while gunfire suddenly erupted in the background.

About six shots in rapid fire could be heard, followed by two seconds of quiet and four additional shots.

“That was what caught my attention initially,” said Lopa Blumenthal, a lawyer for the unnamed man who claims to have made the recording. “It shows a point of contemplation.”

CNN said it could not corroborate the tape’s authenticity, and has reached out to the FBI for confirmation.

Six months before he shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown, police Officer Darren Wilson (pictured) earned a commendation for his “extraordinary effort in the line of duty.” Wilson’s father posted these photos to his Facebook page.

Michael Brown (left) was shot by Ferguson, Mo., Police Officer Darren Wilson (right).

Brown, 18, was unarmed when Officer Darren Wilson shot him after stopping the teen for jaywalking. Witnesses have said that after the initial confrontation with the cop, in which at least one round was fired, Brown was walking away with his hands up and was fired at again.

If the audio is verified by investigators, the pause could bolster the witness accounts.

A preliminary autopsy showed that the teenager was struck at least six times, with two bullets hitting his head.

720,"Pope Francis did not tell boy heaven has room for pets, contrary to report","Taylor Lianne Chandler, a woman who claims to be Michael Phelps' girlfriend, has revealed that she was born intersex and was given the name David Roy Fitch at birth.

As per the Intersex Society of North America, intersex is:

A general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male. For example, a person might be born appearing to be female on the outside, but having mostly male-typical anatomy on the inside. Or a person may be born with genitals that seem to be in-between the usual male and female types. 

Chandler, 41, wrote a lengthy Facebook post outlining her journey but admits that she has never told some people, including Phelps, about her past. 

She writes: 

By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one. In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery.

[...]

The problem is I have made friends that I never told and dated and married people that knew nothing of my past. If you don’t understand what intersex is, Google it. I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.

Eighteen-time Olympic gold medalist Phelps spent most of October in a rehab centre after being arrested for driving under the influence in September. 

Chandler says she met Phelps on the dating app Tinder and described their relationship as being ""like a teenage love affair.""

However, she admitted concern in her post that Phelps would end their relationship: 

I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn’t put him or our relationship in the best light. He is the first man I ever had intimacy with and felt comfortable and all woman. When he went to rehab I had to go through all this scrutiny and tabloid mess by myself. His team at Octagon abandoned me, whether he knows that or not I do not know.

Chandler wrote her Facebook post on November 13th, but it has only now been widely picked up by media outlets such as the Daily Mail and Daily Mirror.

On Wednesday, she wrote, ""Heard from Michael he is out of rehab and back home,"" while also expressing frustration about how her story is being reported. 

Two steps forward and 100 steps backwards. That is what life feels like to me right now. In a world of educated people that had all the facts of intersex and what it means and then to sell a magazine say Michael Phelps is dating a MAN.

722,"Sadly, Pumpkin Spice Condoms Aren't A Thing After All","UTAH COUNTY — Over the years, holiday office Christmas parties have gained a reputation for crazy antics. Often, there's a lot of heavy drinking. One overly zealous drinker in Utah County nearly killed himself a couple of weeks ago, winding up in the hospital for three days.

Even though the drinks at the party contained no alcohol, a heavy drink nearly put Ryan Roche out of commission for the holidays.

""I think it was one of those spur of the moment kind of things,"" Roche said.

As his holiday office party wound down earlier this month, Roche headed for the door with his wife and kids.

""They busted out some eggnog.""

An eggnog-chugging contest was getting started, and one of Roche's colleagues called him out to compete. Roche said he's a competitive guy and couldn't walk away.

""I've already decided, if I'm going to do it, I'm going to win,"" he said.

The record at that point was 22 seconds. There was a Ruth's Chris Steak House gift card on the line, so Roche faced off against two other co-workers.

""I just opened up my throat, didn't even swallow,"" he said. ""I pretty much poured it down.""

I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably. I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.
–Ryan Roche
As the video shows, he drank a quart of eggnog in just 12 seconds, without taking a breath.

""I got done, and I was gasping, I couldn't breathe.""

Roche said he was coughing a lot as he headed home, but thought he would be OK. A couple of hours later, he wasn't so sure.

""I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably,"" he said. ""I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.""

He asked a friend in medical school to come over to his house and check on him. The friend took him to the hospital.

Roche had aspirated the eggnog to his lungs and was essentially ""dry drowning,"" the doctors told him.

""They pretty much had to wheelchair me in, double IV, oxygen, and hooked me up to what they call the nuclear weapon of antibiotics,"" he said.

The liquid in his lungs was starting an infection. He spent 24 hours in intensive care with a fever, sweats and chills.

""It was rough,"" he said. ""Eggnog: not ideal for the lungs.""

On day three in the hospital, doctors took him off oxygen, and he went home. After about a week, he was back at full strength.

It was a holiday mishap he'll never forget, and also probably never live down. Roche did win, but at quite a price.

724,Nicaraguan commission on possible meteorite crash presents rock samples,"The United States appears to now be flying unarmed surveillance drones over the IS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria. The pictures thus far suggest that the drone being used is the MQ-1 Reaper.

The two photos show the distinct downward facing V-shaped tail used on Predator drones, and the aircraft does not appear to be carrying any missiles. As such, the available evidence indicates that the drone is being used for surveillance purposes, rather than in a hunter-killer type mission.

According to local activists, the drone has been circling over the city for three hours. If the reports are true, this would suggest that the air environment over Raqqa is permissive. Drones are visible on radar and easy to shoot down with air defense systems.

The evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery – and possibly signals intelligence (SIGINT) — of Islamic State positions in the group’s most important stronghold. There is little doubt that this mission is intended to give U.S. policymakers more information about IS positions in Raqqa. However, it does not necessarily signal the imminent use of force against IS positions in Syria.

As of now, there is no information about where the drones are based. However, open-source information allows for some informed guesses.

The United States currently bases Predator drones in Turkey at Incirlik Air Force Base in Turkey. The three drones are routinely flown over Northern Iraq and data is shared in real time with the Turkish military.

A second possibility could be that the drones are being flown from Kuwait. Satellite imagery captured the deployment of U.S. drones at Ali Salem Air Base.

A third option is that the United States is now flying drones from an airbase in Iraqi Kurdistan.

A regional security expert also reports that Predator drones were seen operating in the civilian airport near Erbil.

725,Video Purports To Show Beheading Of U.S. Journalist By Militants,"A DESPERATE mother was tricked into feasting on cooked meat from the body of her son by Islamic State militants, it has been claimed.

The famished Kurdish mother had gone to plead with the jihadists to release her son.

Cruel militants delayed talks with the elderly mum – feeding her a meal made with the corpse of her offspring while she waited.

The depraved story was relayed by a brave Briton fighting on the front line with Kurdish forces against the Islamic State, also referred to as IS, ISIS and ISIL.

Yasir Abdulla left behind his wife and children at their Yorkshire home for six months to battle for his Kurdish homeland.

The 36-year-old said the disturbing story was the cause of his hatred against IS – and one of the reasons he has vowed to return to his war-ravaged native county and ""finish the job"".

The father-of-four told The Sun: ""I hate IS because of what happened to an old Kurdish woman from a nearby tribe.

""Her son was captured by IS fighters and taken as a prisoner to Mosul. She was determined to find her son and went to IS headquarters and asked to see him.

""The IS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

""They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were so kind.

But security guard Mr Abdulla then adds: ""They had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said, 'You've just EATEN him'.""

""They burn people alive, they chop off people's heads, there is no limit to their depravity.

""They are not Muslims, they have hijacked Islam. All they do is hate.""

The shocking account is just the latest in a string of disturbing executions and punishments administered by the immoral group.

In February, IS released a highly-choreographed propaganda film showing Jordanian fighter pilot Lieutenant Mouath al-Kasaesbeh soaked in fuel and being burned alive inside a cage.

Another video from the organisation showed a man believed to be gay thrown from a seven-storey building. The 50-year-old man, who was blindfolded throughout his sickening fall, is seen to be still alive after hitting the ground below.

He was later stoned to his death by a waiting mob.

Some have interpreted the perceived increase in brutality from the Islamic State as a sign of their weakness.

The terror organisation have suffered a number of defeats recently, including the loss of two strongholds in Iraq.

Last week, Kurdish gunmen stormed the town of Tel Hamis and fought back control from Islamic State rebels.

The group, aided by US-led coalition airstrikes, previously won back the seized border town of Kobani.

Infamous Islamic State militant Jihadi John, who is believed to have orchestrated the beheadings of dozens of hostages, was last week unmasked as a hypocritical cannabis smoker from west London.

Fearless Mr Abdulla, speaking after temporarily returning to his family home in Keighley, West Yorkshire, said: ""IS are very good at making people scared.

""If they make one person scared then that person will make another person scared and soon everyone is scared of IS.

""But the Kurds are not scared of them. Someone has to stand and fight. We have got thousands of people in many villages and towns behind us.

""If we fall then all of those places fall, and that can't happen. The Peshmerga [Military forces of Iraqi Kurdistan] can't wait to take the fight to IS.

He and the other living founding members of legendary hard-rock band Led Zeppelin were about to ink an $800 million contract with Virgin Atlantic billionaire Richard Branson to play a reunion tour, but the iconic band’s singer ripped the contract to shreds in the final moments, a report said.
Founding members Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones signed on immediately when the flamboyant investor offered the Rock and Roll Hall of Famers the staggering amount to perform just 35 tour dates in three locations including London, Berlin and New Jersey, according to the UK’s Mirror.
But Branson was left stunned when the 66-year-old Plant tore the agreement to pieces right in front of the concert promoters, the newspaper said.
“There was an enormous sense of shock,” a source told the Mirror. “He said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given.”
Guitarist Page and bassist Jones were all set to perform along with drummer Jason Bonham, who has filled in for his late father, John Bonham, in the past.
They gave their cranky frontman two days to think about the historic reunion, and he turned into a real heartbreaker for fans who have dreamed of another reunion tour.
“It was a no-brainer for them, but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it,” the source said. “They have tried to talk him ’round, but there is no chance. His mind is made up and that’s that.”
And it’s not likely that the band can hire a replacement for Plant’s unique voice.
“There is no way they can go ahead without him,” the source said.
Branson, a tremendous fan of the ’70s rock band, reportedly pulled out all the stops to get the “The Song Remains the Same” rockers back on stage together.
The founder of Virgin Group was planning on renaming one of his jumbo jets “The Starship” and having the craft ferry the stars around to their gigs.
He was even going to have the staircase of the jet renamed the Stairway to Heaven after the band’s landmark hit.
“Even his money was not enough to get Plant to sign up,” the source said, adding that the tycoon was very upset by the singer’s diss.
The band last played together, with Jason Bonham filling in on drums, during a tribute concert at London’s O2 arena in 2007.
The band has been notoriously cranky about whether it would ever reunite, with Plant even calling one reporter a “schmuck” during a press conference in 2012.",unrelated

DNA tests have confirmed that the child held by Lebanese authorities is the daughter of the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Lebanon’s Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk told domestic television channel MTV that the child’s mother is believed to have married to al-Baghdadi six years ago for a period of three months, the BBC reports.

The Iraqi government had said she was not married to the Islamist leader.

The woman, identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, tried to enter Lebanon over a week ago accompanied by two sons and a daughter when she was detained by border guards.

Machnouk claims al-Dulaimi is pregnant but the child is not al-Baghdadi’s.

“We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is [al-Baghdadi’s] daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq,” Machnouk told MTV.

Machnouk said the children were staying at a care center while al-Dulaimi was being interrogated.

Whatever the case, the quest for better pictures and videos of Bigfoot, Yeti, Almasti and their counterparts got a new entry this week from Adygeysk, Russia. That’s where a local mountain rescue team, after getting calls of Yeti sightings in the Adygeysk area, went out to investigate. They found what they were looking for and had the presence of mind and steadiness of hand to take a video of the Yeti walking away from them.

Adygeysk is a city and tourist destination in the Republic of Adygea in southern Eastern Europe at the heavily forested foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. The local remote rescue service, part of the Emergency Ministry, received calls of Yeti sightings, which prompted the TV station to investigate. Ludmila Hristoforova was one of the witnesses identified in the TV report and gave this description:
The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we’ve seen something big and shaggy.
Senior search team Andrei Kazaryan was one of the investigators and says he heard the foot crunches and found footprints.
They were 5 to 6 centimeters deep and couldn’t come from a human foot. We took a plaster cast of them and we estimate that it probably would have taken about 200 kilos to press the snow down that much.
The footprint cast and video were given to scientists and to a local museum, which has an exhibit on Yeti.

The Caucasus mountains are known for Yeti and particularly Almasti or wild man sightings, so this occurrence is not unusual.

The Axl Rose death hoax started on a bogus site forged to look like a page on the MSNBC website. The authentic looking — at a cursory glance, anyway — story was headlined, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52,” and claimed that the “Welcome To The Jungle” singer was found dead after police were called to check on the former rock star’s welfare.

Perhaps in a vain attempt to add an air of authenticity to the latest death hoax, the phony story on the ersatz MSNBC site claimed the death of Axl Rose remained “unconfirmed.”

“It’s fake, dude,” wrote the site Mediaite, in its story mocking the Axl Rose death hoax. “You can go ahead and confirm it.”

The site Gossip Cop, which specializes in debunking rumors about celebrities — dead or alive — was among the first to expose the fakery, which apparently fooled numerous internet users with its convincing-looking URL, “msnbc.website.”

“The awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories,” reported Gossip Cop. “Enough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website.”

In addition to Home Alone star Culkin, and today’s hogwash “Axl Rose is dead” prank, other celebrities victimized by death hoaxes recently have included “Dog Whisperer” Cesar Millan, ’80s “Brat Pack” actor Judd Nelson, and TV Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno.

While Axl Rose and his representatives have not confirmed that the “Paradise City” crooner is actually still living and breathing, but they probably don’t need to. But one thing is certain. Axl Rose may be the latest, but will certainly not be the last “dead” but-not-really celebrity to be the subject of a yet another tiresome online death hoax.",unrelated

What's the point of strapping a tiny computer to your body if it needs constant charging? According to Re/code, even Apple hasn't quite figured out the battery dilemma yet.

After Tim Cook mentioned charging Apple Watch ""every night"" on stage, John Paczkowski confirms today that a source within Apple pins the charge-by date at nightly—which would imply that the Apple Watch has a battery life of less than a day. Apparently, Apple is still working to improve that number before release. ""We anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging,"" an Apple spokesperson told Paczkowski, seemingly confirming the source.

This isn't just Apple's problem. As a paradigm, smartwatches still have quite a few kinks that need working out before they'll seem truly functional—and battery life is one of the biggest. On Monday, Gizmodo's Brent Rose reported that the Moto 360's battery life, while not as bad as expected, was only about 24 hours.

That's not terrible, but it does present some problems from a user experience perspective. The main selling point of many smartwatches is that they will constantly track your activity, from sleeping to working out. If your device needs to be charged for even a few hours every day, that's lost data, as information designer Nicholas Felton pointed out yesterday on Twitter:

Also sad that the watch charging solution means unbroken health stats are impossible. Not necessary for everyone, but important for many.

Sure, not everyone cares about tracking things like REM cycles. Not everyone will mind taking off their watch for a few hours every day.

737,"Boko Haram leader denies ceasefire deal, says 200 abducted girls married off ","More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in April, sparking the #BringBackOurGirls campaign

A top military official in Nigeria was reported Friday to have announced a cease-fire between the government and the military group Boko Haram, igniting both skepticism and hopes that more than 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped in April would be released.

The truce was said to be announced by Air Marshall Alex Badeh, Nigeria’s chief of defense, the Associated Press reports. The release of the girls is still being negotiated, Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade added, but the cease-fire would begin immediately and could take take several days to reach the groups of militants.

“Already, the terrorists have announced a cease-fire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a cease-fire,” said Mike Omeri, a government spokesman on Boko Haram, at a news conference. The AP adds that Omeri confirmed negotiations about the girls’ potential release were held throughout the week.

Reports of the deal were met with hesitation by those who have followed the saga since the girls were abducted from their school in Chibok on April 14. There was neither an official statement quickly released by the government, nor an announcement made by the insurgent group, the New York Times reports.

Boko Haram, which released a video in May that claimed responsibility for the girls’ abductions and vowed to “sell them on the market, by Allah,” has previously demanded the release of rebel prisoners in exchange for their freedom. But Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who has faced intense global pressure to free the students, said that’s a trade he will not make. The Nigerian government has in the past misled the public about the girls’ status; its fight against Boko Haram has been fraught with challenges since the militant group rose up in 2009, from inefficiency and corruption in the military to lax local support in the northern communities that are threatened most.

In August, the Wall Street Journal reported that American surveillance planes spotted groups that appeared to be the missing girls, suggesting that not all of them had been sold into marriage or slavery — as feared — and that some were perhaps being kept as a bargaining tactic.",discuss
738,Journalist James Wright Foley reportedly beheaded by ISIS,"Militants from Islamic State (Isis) claimed to have killed an American journalist long held captive in Syria in retaliation for ongoing US airstrikes against its forces in Iraq.

A propaganda video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man dressed in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Wright Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012.

The masked executioner spoke in English, with what sounded like a British accent, and said that the slaying came in response to the airstrikes ordered by President Barack Obama against Isis 12 days ago.

Isis, whose chief spokesman came under State Department sanctions on Monday, warned of further revenge – including on another man purported to be a captured US journalist, Steven Sotloff – and in the video, the victim was made to read a statement blaming the US for his own murder.

Foley has been missing in Syria since November 2012, where he went to report on the bloody struggle to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. He was initially thought to have been captured by forces loyal to the Assad regime.

A Facebook message from a support group, Free James Foley, urged patience “until we all have more information,” and asked that readers “keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

YouTube took down the gruesome video, but not before it sparked a debate on social media about the ethics of sharing it, adding a metatextual debate to a depiction of a man’s violent death.

Foley, 40, a former Stars and Stripes reporter, was captured in November 2012 near the Syrian town of Taftanaz. It was not his first detention while reporting: in 2011, he was taken while reporting on the uprising against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi’s forces ultimately released him after six weeks in captivity.

A friend of Foley’s and his fellow captive in Libya, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote in a 2013 essay that captivity was “the state most violently opposite his nature.” Gillis described Foley as gentle, friendly, courageous and impatient with “anything that slows his forward momentum.”

In a January 2013 interview with local television news near her Rochester, New Hampshire home, Foley’s mother Diane said her son was “passionate about covering the story in Syria, passionate about the people there.”

Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said US intelligence was working to determine the authenticity of the video.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said in a statement.

Messages left with the Foley family were not returned.

A day after Obama declared that Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US warplanes had broken Isis’ hold on the critical Mosul Dam, US Central Command announced two strikes near it on Monday, to “further expand control of the area.” One strike was said to have destroyed an Isis checkpoint while the other was “not successful.”

Obama has offered no timeframe for the length of his campaign against Isis. The US military has bombed over 90 targets attributed to Isis, including vehicle convoys, mobile artillery and fixed positions, since 8 August. Most of the strikes have come in the past few days, near the dam. The other strikes have occurred either to blunt an Isis advance on the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil or to lift an Isis siege on Mount Sinjar, where it chased thousands of Iraqi Yazidis whom it threatened to kill unless they converted to Islam. The US considers the siege broken.",discuss

PROBABLY FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, September 2014]

Seeking truth in stir of 11 missing / stolen commercial airliners from the Libyan airport during the fall of Tripoli.

Origins: In early August 2014, some North African bloggers began to spread stories that several commercial airliners were missing from the Tripoli International Airport during or shortly after the facility was taken over by Zintan militia forces earlier in the summer. Later that month translations of the blog posts began to be picked up by news outlets in Western Europe and passed on as fact rather than gossip; by early September those tales of translations of blogs had spread to the United States under the guise of real news.

The use of airplanes as terrorist weapons in 2001 makes it all too easy for us to anticipate their being used that way again. And despite denials from all sides — the airlines who are not missing any planes, the Libyan transport ministry, and the anti-government forces in control of the airport — the tales have found a ready audience among a populace already on edge in anticipation of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

However, there have been no statements from the State Department, the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, or any other authority warning of stolen airliners. The national threat level has not been raised. Algerian and Moroccan military and air defense, already on high alert due to the unrest just across their borders with Libya, would undoubtedly have noticed multiple flights of unidentified passenger aircraft.

If you take the view that Apple Watch is simply another smartwatch or gadget, the prices may not make that much sense. Look at the device as a fashion statement with smarts, though, and the anticipated costs sound viable. Apple has designed the watch and will market it as a modern timepiece that adds smartwatch functions to your wrist.

You can buy a plastic Pebble smartwatch for as little as $99 now, recently discounted from its $149 price. The same watch and functionality in a more aesthetically pleasing stainless steel case will cost you $199, or double the plastic model’s price. It’s reasonable to assume an Apple Watch with stainless steel casing will cost $500 based on that. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see that come with a leather strap, with an additional $50 to $100 cost for a matching stainless steel strap.

Unfortunately, we’re not likely to know the official retail costs until this coming spring, as Apple won’t be selling the Apple Watch until then. For now, potential customers have time to save up for Apple’s timepiece — something they may need to do if they want an Apple Watch in gold.",unrelated

Amazingly, in a sprawling city of 1.2 million people, the impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries, but it did leave a crater measuring 12 metres across and was felt throughout the capital late on Saturday.

Nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed “2014 RC,” which passed very close to Earth yesterday and was estimated by astronomers to be about 20 metres big, or the size of a house.

“We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact,” said Wilfredo Strauss of the Seismic Institute.

The meteorite appeared to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport around midnight and the hit was so large that it registered on the instruments Strauss’s organisation uses to size up earthquakes.

“You can see two waves: first, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth, and then another stronger one, which is the impact of the sound,” he said.

Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday. One of them, William Martinez, said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil.

“You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,” Martinez said.

Government spokeswoman, First Lady Rosario Murillo, said Managua would be in contact with the US Geological Service to try to get more information about “this fascinating event” in the Central American nation, one of Latin America’s poorest countries.

People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion, and that liquid, sand and dust were blown through the air, which smelled like something had burned.

There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot, and flights at the airport were not affected.

NASA said last week that the asteroid 2014 RC, at the time of closest approach, would be approximately one-tenth the distance from the centre of Earth to the moon, or about 40,000 kilometres.

It had been projected to be roughly over New Zealand at the time of its closest approach.

According to Bleeding Cool (who are often pretty reliable on the rumour front), ""The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen."" Seriously? The best set video we can get of the iconic vehicle in action is from about 300 feet away, but someone got close enough to steal one of the damn things? As I said, this is hard to believe and we've heard nothing official on this, but if you see the newest version of the Batmobile charging around the streets of Detroit (or even on eBay...), it's probably been stolen! Remember, you can check out the first official image of the Batmobile by clicking here!

748,DNA tests prove Lebanon IS holding ISIS chief al-Baghdadi's ex-wife and daughter after they were caught with fake passports,"Dramatic footage from an Afghanistan battlefield shows the moment a U.S. Marine survived a bullet to his head, thanks to his kevlar helmet.

According to Sam Arnold, who posted the video on YouTube, the footage was recorded on a helmet camera during a “joint helicopter raid” in the Now Zad district of Helmand Province in 2013.

At the start of the incredible three-minute video, gunfire is heard in the background, and three Marines decide to try to find out where the shots came from. They pass through a tunnel stocked with barrels and wood, and peek through a doorway on the south side of the compound. Then, a bullet strikes one of the Marine’s helmets, knocking his head back. The three marines turn around and run back to their original position.

“Dude, you got shot,” says the Marine who caught the dramatic event on camera. “I saw it hit your kevlar.”

“I did get shot,” the other Marine replies. He seems remarkably calm, but a little dazed. His only complaint is that his ears are ringing.

“Lucky son of a b—h,” says the one with the camera.

The three Marines join other members of their unit and head off to track down the “Taliban sniper” before the video ends. The footage was uploaded two weeks ago and has been viewed more than 610,000 times.",unrelated
749,Sources: Guns N' Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52,"Oh Internet, when will you ever stop killing perfectly healthy celebrities, or at least those that are healthy enough to be alive? Today, one of those ridiculously stupid and fake-looking hoax sites that generates random celebrity death stories once again proved that people are gullible and should have to take IQ tests to use the Internet. Looking like an MSNBC page that stopped loading in 2004, the farticle (that’s my name for these fake articles) claimed that sources were “reporting” that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose was found dead yesterday from unknown causes in his West Hollywood home.

“The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area,” read the report created by a douchebag with a presumably large, Dorito-speckled smirk on his face. While plenty of people fell for it enough for the link to start spreading on Facebook and Twitter, the sleuths at Gossip Cop quickly proved that it was fake. Probably by looking at it.

The awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories. A new phony report has the headline, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”

Enough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website. (Via Gossip Cop)

One of these days, Rose might actually pass away and then none of us will believe it because of these stupid hoax reports. And then his funeral will be really sad when it starts raining and Slash plays a guitar solo with no shirt under his leather jacket on top of Rose’s casket, and nobody’s there to appreciate it.

750,The Image That Everyone Is Sharing By 'Banksy' Isn't By Banksy — But It's Awesome,"(Reuters) - First there was bendgate... now brace yourself for hairgate.

Fresh from the online uproar over whether the shiny new iPhone 6 bends when carried around in pockets, Apple has been hit by a new complaint - that the handset traps users' hair or beards when they make calls.

It is difficult to gauge whether there is any real issue, but Twitter users have made #hairgate a rising social media trend, leading major news outlets to pounce on the story.

""The seam on my iPhone 6 where the aluminum meets the glass is definitely catching my hair and pulling it out,"" one user tweeted.

Bearded iPhone users have jumped on the bandwagon complaining that their facial hair gets yanked during calls, leading to spats over whether to treat #beardgate as a separate trend, or simply as a subset of #hairgate.

Apple was not immediately available to comment.

Jokers are having a field day, with the Twitter account of the Atlanta International Fashion Week speculating that it may be an elaborate plot against hipsters for whom facial hair has become de rigeur. Another user tweeted: ""Congrats, Apple, for finally getting hipsters to shave.""

For some it is a heaven-sent marketing opportunity; Gillette Co. [PGGIL.UL] was quick to tweet: ""Your phone may be smarter than ever, but leave the shaving to the experts.""

However, many iPhone 6 users were left to wonder what all the fuss was about.

""I have iPhone 6. Doesn't bend and doesn't snag hair. Who thinks up these things? Apple haters? Competitors?"" tweeted Dr. John Wooten, a Virginia-based technical consultant.

751,An audio recording of the Michael Brown shooting has reportedly surfaced,"A baseball cap and a portrait of Michael Brown is shown alongside his casket inside Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church before the start of funeral services in St. Louis, Missouri. Photo: Reuters

Ferguson: An audio recording released on Tuesday morning may shed light on the death of a Missouri teenager fatally shot by a police officer August 9, which have sparked protests that resumed this week.

The tape, provided to CNN, allegedly contains audio captured during a Ferguson resident's video chat at the time of the shooting. CNN says the authenticity of the tape has yet to be verified, but what appears to be gunfire can be heard in the background of the call.

As many as 10 shot-like sounds can be heard. Several shots are fired in what appears to be fairly quick succession. There is a brief pause, then more shots are fired.

An autopsy concluded that Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times, with two fatal shots to the head. The Ferguson officer involved has been identified as Darren Wilson, 28.

Law enforcement officials and bystanders have provided differing accounts of what led to the fatal encounter. Police say Mr Wilson stopped Brown and a friend for walking in the street, asking the two to move to the sidewalk, and words were exchanged. According to Mr Wilson's account, he was attacked by Brown as he attempted to exit his cruiser and the two scuffled for the officer's gun inside the car.

Both Mr Wilson and witnesses concede Brown took off running. The witnesses say the officer fired on the unarmed teen as he had his hands up to surrender. Wilson supporters say Brown was bull-rushing Wilson, who shot Brown in self-defense.

The shooting ignited racial tensions, sparking several days and nights of protests, riots, looting and unrest, which have resumed.

More than 100 demonstrators marched in St. Louis on Tuesday demanding the arrest of a white police officer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.

The protesters, who called for Mr Wilson's arrest and the removal of Ferguson police leaders, were blocked from walking up the courthouse steps by a group of officers, most on bicycles.

Few signs were visible at what has been the centre of the protests along West Florissant in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb.

A man under a gazebo sold T-shirts that read ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" the chant favoured by demonstrators, as the temperature reached 34 Celsius at midday.

People gathered in small groups at the impromptu memorial set up where Brown died and two women handed out food from a folding table.

""This community has had a story to tell for a long time and this has just been the catalyst,"" said Chelsea Warlick, 29, a photographer from Savannah, Georgia. The majority of people in Ferguson are black, while most of its elected officials and police force are white.

Ms Warlick, who laid white roses by the memorial, said she was about to sign a six-month lease on an apartment in the complex where Brown lived to support the community.

""The verdict is everything. If he doesn't go to jail for what he did this place is going to burn,"" she said of Mr Wilson.

The Missouri National Guard, which began a gradual pullout from Ferguson on Friday, was absent from a spot on West Florissant they had occupied late on Monday.

Brown's funeral service was Monday, and the case is currently being presented to a grand jury. Attorney General Eric Holder has promised a thorough investigation.

The organisation Black Lawyers for Justice plans to file a $US200 million class action lawsuit against Ferguson authorities Tuesday, KDSK-TV reported. According to the organisation's website, the group's mission is to fight police brutality.

752,Lebanon confirms holding ISIS chief’s kin,"A lot of folks are buzzing about 17-year-old Stuyvesant High School senior Mohammed ""Mo"" Islam who is rumored to have made $72 million from trading.

New York Magazine's Jessica Pressler profiled him in a recent issue.

But a number of folks who know Islam told Business Insider that they strongly believe that the $72 million figure is just a rumor - a rumor that Islam hasn't denied.

In the article, he acknowledged to Pressler over caviar and apple juice that his net worth was in the ""high eight figures.""

A source familiar with the story told Business Insider that Islam is not worth $72 million. The source believes it's a rumor started by Islam's friends or partners that was perpetuated by the New York Magazine article.

Pressler has also defended the story. She Tweeted that she saw a bank statement with the eight figures and is comfortable with what's in the piece. She also Tweeted that New York Magazine ""is not a financial publication.""

Business Insider actually featured Islam on our list of ""20 Under 20"" in finance just over a year ago. He was nominated by his peers.

In a phone interview on Monday Islam's partner Damir Tulemagabetov, who was also in the New York Magazine article, said the $72 million figure isn't necessarily completely accurate.

""Let me put it this way...it's stated as a rumor,"" Tulemaganbetov told us when we asked him if he would deny the $72 million figure. He was with Islam in a car headed to CNBC's studios in New Jersey.

""All the hype, [Islam] deserves it,"" Tulemaganbetov said. Adding that he is ""pretty sure"" Islam is a ""a great trader"" and that he's a ""genius.""

Business Insider asked for audited numbers or P&L statements to prove that Islam's networth is close to $72 million. Tulemaganbetov refused.

Islam himself did not respond to our email this morning requesting the numbers. He also would not get on the phone when Business Insider learned he was riding in the car to CNBC.

The investment club for young traders, of which Islam is a member, sent Business Insider this statement regarding the $72 million figure:

It has been brought to the attention of the Leaders Investment Club that Mohammed Islam has been rumored to have made $72,000,000 through making trades in the stock market. After performing due diligence and talking with Mohammed Islam himself, we have determined that these claims are false and simply been blown up by the media in the interests of sensationalism.

Islam's partner Tulemaganbetov, however, would not be that clear in his coversation with Business Insider.

""We can't just talk about the numbers. It's not just about the money,"" Tulemaganbetov said. ""We're on the verge of a lot of great things in our lives so we can't just focus on providing you the statements. We're on the verge of a lot of great things. We are going to talk to CNBC.""

Again, Business Insider pressed the issue of the P&L statements.

""All those statements...that's good for you. We know what we're doing. We're managing this whole hype and everything. We are trying to work with it. We were never expecting it and never denied. You have no proof.""

Tulemaganbetov told us that Islam didn't expect all the attention. He just expected a magazine article.

""The guy became famous all over the world in 24 hours. He's all over the world. The next thing we wake up and he's famous. This guy is a celebrity all over the world right now.""

Tulemaganbetov told us that they were going to ""make it clear on CNBC.""

753,Jordan’s King May Participate Personally In ISIS Raids,"A small meteorite landed near the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, on Saturday night, government officials say.

Residents reported hearing a loud bang and feeling the impact, which left a crater 12m (40ft) wide and 5m deep.

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said the meteorite seemed to have broken off an asteroid which was passing close to Earth.

She said international experts had been called in to investigate further.

No-one was hurt when it hit the wooded area near the international airport and an air force base.

'Like a bomb'

An adviser to Nicaragua's Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter), Wilfried Strauch, said he was ""convinced it was a meteorite"" which caused the impact.

Experts studying the crater said it was not clear whether the meteorite had disintegrated upon impact or had been blasted into soil.

Locals said they heard a large blast just before midnight local time and reported a burning smell.

""We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria told Associated Press news agency.

Asteroid link?

Ineter scientist Jose Millan said that ""we need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population"".

Managua, which has more than a million inhabitants is densely populated.

""All the evidence that we've confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event,"" he said.

""We have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact,"" he added.

Astronomer Humberto Saballos said the meteorite could have broken off from the 2014RC asteroid which passed Earth at the same time.

2014RC, which is the size of a house, came closest to earth at 18:18 GMT on Sunday, when it passed over New Zealand at a distance of about 40,000km (25,000 miles).

The asteroid was first discovered on 31 August and, at its closest approach, was about one-tenth of the distance from the centre of Earth to the Moon, Nasa said in a statement.

It is expected to orbit near Earth again in the future.

In February 2013, a meteorite exploded over Chelyabinsk in Central Russia, injuring more than 1,000 people.

Nasa currently tracks more than 11,000 asteroids in orbits that pass relatively close to Earth.",unrelated
754,Magic Mushrooms Found in Queen Elizabeth's Garden at Buckingham Palace,"On Friday, a rumor cropped up that one of the new Batmobile vehicles had been stolen in Detroit. The story wasn’t verified, but it did end up at a couple bigger news outlets. Because who can resist the phrase “stolen Batmobile”? Thankfully it was all just a rumor, but the story did give Batman v Superman director Zack Snyder a reason to pull together some of the minor resources at his disposal for a great photo op. 

Bleeding Cool had the original rumor, and also hilariously scolded CBS for picking up the story. In an update, the site even praised the Detroit Free Press for killing the story BC created in the first place. The DFP reports:

Detroit police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody said that police confirmed with producers of “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” that the vehicle has not been stolen, a rumor that proliferated on the web and social media on Friday.

“The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,” Woody said.

755,U.S. airstrike kills Islamic Al Shabab terrorist leader in Somalia,"The man who jumped the White House fence this month and sprinted through the front door made it much farther into the building than previously known, overpowering one Secret Service officer and running through much of the main floor, according to three people familiar with the incident.

An alarm box near the front entrance of the White House designed to alert guards to an intruder had been muted at what officers believed was a request of the usher’s office, said a Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. Officers are trained that, upon learning of an intruder on the grounds, often through the alarm boxes posted around the property, they must immediately lock the front door.

After barreling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first family’s living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.

Gonzalez was tackled by a counter-assault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.

Secret Service officials had earlier said he was quickly detained at the main entry. Agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said the office is not commenting due to an ongoing investigation of the incident.

People jumping over the White House fence has become a more common occurrence, but most individuals are tackled by Secret Services officers guarding the complex before getting even a third of the way across the lawn. Gonzalez is the first person known to have jumped the fence and made it inside the executive mansion.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the breach was “unacceptable” to her, and on Friday she briefed President Obama on her plans to shore up security.

Pierson is expected to face tough questions about the Gonzalez incident Tuesday at a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The hearing is likely to cover a number of security lapses by the agency, including new revelations published over the weekend by The Washington Post about the failure to identify and properly investigate a 2011 shooting attack on the White House.

The more detailed account of this month’s security breach comes from people who provided information about the incident to The Washington Post and whistleblowers who contacted Rep. Jason Chaffetz, (R-Utah), chairman of a House Oversight subcommittee on Homeland Security.

Chaffetz said he plans to ask Pierson how an alarm meant to alert officers to intruders could be silenced or turned down. The congressman said two people inside the agency told him that boxes were silenced because the White House usher staff, whose office is near the front door, complained they were noisy. A Secret Service official told The Post that the usher’s office was concerned the boxes were frequently malfunctioning and unnecessarily sounding off.

The alarm boxes, which officers call “crash boxes,” are key pieces of the agency’s first-alert system, according to former agents and officials. If they spot an intruder, officers are trained to hit the large red button on the nearest box — sending an alert to every post on the complex about the location of an incursion, and piping sound from that location to other boxes around the property.

“If true, the fact that crash boxes were muted to avoid being ‘disruptive’ is not due to a lack of resources or an insufficient number of checkpoints or barriers,” Chaffetz said.

He called the incident a “failure of leadership” by the Secret Service.

“The agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,” Chaffetz said. “It must examine what message is being sent to the men and women who protect the president when their leader sacrifices security to appease superficial concerns of White House ushers.”

The new revelations follow accounts provided to The Post last week detailing how Gonzalez’s ability to enter the White House reflected a failure of multiple levels of security around the compound. The agency relies on these successive layers as a fail-safe for protecting the president and the White House complex.

In this incident, a plainclothes surveillance team was on duty that night outside the fence, meant to spot jumpers and give early warning before they made it over. When that team didn’t notice Gonzalez, there was an officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn. When that officer couldn’t reach Gonzales, there was supposed to be an attack dog, a specialized SWAT team and a guard at the front door — all at the ready.

The dog was not released, a decision now under review. Some people familiar with the incident say the handler likely felt he could not release the dog because so many officers were in pursuit of Gonzalez, and the dog may have attacked them instead.

Since the incident, the Secret Service has added an additional layer of temporary fencing while the agency reviews its procedures.

Alice Crites contributed to this report.

Chief of Defence Staff Air Marshal Alex Badeh told senior military officials from Nigeria and Cameroon meeting in Abuja that a ""ceasefire agreement"" had been concluded between the government and the insurgents.

""I have accordingly directed the service chiefs to ensure immediate compliance with this development,"" he added.

Badeh's announcement came after a senior aide to President Goodluck Jonathan, Hassan Tukur, told AFP that an agreement to end hostilities had been reached following talks, as well as for the release of 219 girls held captive since April.

But a precedent of previous claims from the government and military about an end to the deadly five-year conflict and the fate of the missing teenagers left many observers urging caution.

Jonathan is also expected to declare his bid for re-election in the coming weeks, with positive news about the hostages and the violence likely to give him a political boost.

Multiple analysts cast doubt over the credibility of a man called Danladi Ahmadu, whom Tukur claimed represented Boko Haram at the two meetings in neighbouring Chad.

""I have never heard of such a man (Ahmadu) and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire it would come from the group's leader Abubakar Shekau,"" said Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government.

Ralph Bello-Fadile an advisor to Nigeria's National Security Advisor (NSA), told a conference on Monday that the NSA has been inundated with fraudsters claiming to represent Shekau.

""Government wants to negotiate,"" he told a Chatham House event in Abuja, ""but so far nobody has come forward who speaks for Shekau.""

- Chad talks -

Tukur said he represented the government at two meetings with the Islamists in Chad, which were mediated by the country's President Idriss Deby.

""Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,"" said Tukur, adding that Ahmadu made the announcement on Thursday evening.

""They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,"" he continued, referring to the girls seized in northeast Nigeria on April 14, causing global outrage.

Ndjamena refused to comment but security sources in the country said Chad, which Jonathan visited for talks with Deby early last month, had been involved in the discussions.

The source also said a ceasefire agreement was reached as well as the release of 27 hostages, 10 of them Chinese nationals, who were kidnapped in northern Cameroon earlier this year.

The release of the hostages last weekend was ""a first strong signal"" from Boko Haram to prove their good faith, the source added but did not mention the schoolgirls.

- Discrepancies -

Ahmadu gave an interview broadcast on Friday on the Hausa language service of Voice of America radio in which he claimed to be the group's ""chief security officer"" and in charge of publicity.

He made no mention of an end to hostilities and was vague on details of the apparent talks, even claiming not to have met Shekau.

He also referred to the jihadi group as Boko Haram, a name that means 'Western education is forbidden' which was imposed on the Islamist radicals by outsiders. The insurgents themselves never use the term.

The group's known leaders have exclusively used the name Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, which means ""People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad"".

He made no reference to the Chibok girls and did not list the creation of an Islamic state in Nigeria's mainly Muslim north -- the core, unwavering Boko Haram demand since the uprising began.

Shekau has in a series of video messages since 2012 ruled out talks with the government and said northern Nigeria will never know peace until sharia (Islamic law) is strictly enforced.

Envoys from Nigeria's presidency have made similar ceasefire claims in the past, notably Jonathan's Minister for Special Duties Taminu Turaki, who led a so-called amnesty commission in 2013 that was tasked with brokering peace.

Turaki on several occasions maintained that he was negotiating with legitimate Boko Haram commanders, including Shekau's immediate deputies, and that a ceasefire was at hand.

But nothing materialised from Turaki's protracted negotiations. Shekau said that he never sent delegates to any talks and attacks continued at a relentless pace.",discuss

761,Audio recording allegedly captures moment Michael Brown was shot,"The man who jumped the White House fence this month and sprinted through the front door made it much farther into the building than previously known, overpowering one Secret Service officer and running through much of the main floor, according to three people familiar with the incident.

An alarm box near the front entrance of the White House designed to alert guards to an intruder had been muted at what officers believed was a request of the usher’s office, said a Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. Officers are trained that, upon learning of an intruder on the grounds, often through the alarm boxes posted around the property, they must immediately lock the front door.

After barreling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first family’s living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.

Gonzalez was tackled by a counter-assault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.

Secret Service officials had earlier said he was quickly detained at the main entry. Agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said the office is not commenting due to an ongoing investigation of the incident.

People jumping over the White House fence has become a more common occurrence, but most individuals are tackled by Secret Services officers guarding the complex before getting even a third of the way across the lawn. Gonzalez is the first person known to have jumped the fence and made it inside the executive mansion.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the breach was “unacceptable” to her, and on Friday she briefed President Obama on her plans to shore up security.

Pierson is expected to face tough questions about the Gonzalez incident Tuesday at a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The hearing is likely to cover a number of security lapses by the agency, including new revelations published over the weekend by The Washington Post about the failure to identify and properly investigate a 2011 shooting attack on the White House.

The more detailed account of this month’s security breach comes from people who provided information about the incident to The Washington Post and whistleblowers who contacted Rep. Jason Chaffetz, (R-Utah), chairman of a House Oversight subcommittee on Homeland Security.

Chaffetz said he plans to ask Pierson how an alarm meant to alert officers to intruders could be silenced or turned down. The congressman said two people inside the agency told him that boxes were silenced because the White House usher staff, whose office is near the front door, complained they were noisy. A Secret Service official told The Post that the usher’s office was concerned the boxes were frequently malfunctioning and unnecessarily sounding off.

The alarm boxes, which officers call “crash boxes,” are key pieces of the agency’s first-alert system, according to former agents and officials. If they spot an intruder, officers are trained to hit the large red button on the nearest box — sending an alert to every post on the complex about the location of an incursion, and piping sound from that location to other boxes around the property.

“If true, the fact that crash boxes were muted to avoid being ‘disruptive’ is not due to a lack of resources or an insufficient number of checkpoints or barriers,” Chaffetz said.

He called the incident a “failure of leadership” by the Secret Service.

“The agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,” Chaffetz said. “It must examine what message is being sent to the men and women who protect the president when their leader sacrifices security to appease superficial concerns of White House ushers.”

The new revelations follow accounts provided to The Post last week detailing how Gonzalez’s ability to enter the White House reflected a failure of multiple levels of security around the compound. The agency relies on these successive layers as a fail-safe for protecting the president and the White House complex.

In this incident, a plainclothes surveillance team was on duty that night outside the fence, meant to spot jumpers and give early warning before they made it over. When that team didn’t notice Gonzalez, there was an officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn. When that officer couldn’t reach Gonzales, there was supposed to be an attack dog, a specialized SWAT team and a guard at the front door — all at the ready.

The dog was not released, a decision now under review. Some people familiar with the incident say the handler likely felt he could not release the dog because so many officers were in pursuit of Gonzalez, and the dog may have attacked them instead.

Since the incident, the Secret Service has added an additional layer of temporary fencing while the agency reviews its procedures.

763,ISIS Beheads American Journalist,"ISIS militants released gruesome video footage this afternoon of the beheading of American photojournalist James Wright Foley as a message to the U.S. to stop intervening in Iraq. Foley, a freelancer who contributed to the Global Post, was first captured in Libya in 2012, released, and then kidnapped again around Thanksgiving 2012 by unidentified gunmen in Syria. He was 39 years old.

The (extremely disturbing) video can be viewed here. @Mujahid4life tweeted stills from it, which are (aside from the one below), sickeningly graphic.

The Global Post reported the circumstances of his disappearance last year, after attempting to keep the news quiet for fear of Foley's safety:

Foley had set off toward the border in a car about an hour before his capture. A witness, a Syrian, later recounted over the phone to a journalist in Turkey that an unmarked car intercepted Foley. The witness said men holding kalashnikovs shot into the air and forced Jim out of the car.

The witness said he noticed nothing that would indicate whether the aggressors were rebel fighters, individuals looking for a ransom, members of a pro-government militia, or a religious-based group with other motivations.
He was held captive for 635 days.

In 2013, Foley's family set up a Find James Foley website for him, which states that he's the oldest of five children. His friend, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote about him for Syria Deeply last year:

Jim sees the good in nearly everything and everyone. He is a master motivator. ""You got this, dude!"" he'll say. ""That story's great, just file it already."" ...

765,The Chinese Guide to Avoiding a Bad English Name,"Chinese people have been given state advice on the adoption of English sounding names – being urged to avoid those that make them sound like a “stripper” and instead opt for ones that imply the bearer is from “a fancy or conservative family”.

A report published on the website of CCTV, a state broadcaster, offered readers practical advice on the selection of their Western-style name, a rite of passage for most young Chinese.

“Take heed,” the article said. “English names come with different connotations…A name can come with a 'feeling’ or idea about what sort of person you are.”

Names “with a distinct feeling of Britishness” such as Elizabeth, William and Catherine were considered as “safe” by the article, which was illustrated with a picture of the Royal family.

But other, less desirable name types were also listed, such as those derived from “suggestive” foods such as Candy, Lolly and Sugar which were “typically thought of as 'non-smart girl’ names, or 'stripper’ names.”

Picking the distinctive name of a world leader of celebrity such as Obama or Madonna, or that of a religious figure (“Satan”), was not advised.

Jilted lover Oliver Ilic reportedly tossed his member in the trash after slicing it off with a single swipe from a razor blade.

The 22-year-old lay bleeding on the floor of his Kocani home for several minutes before calling emergency services.

MGM Resorts International revealed on an earnings call Tuesday that unidentified guests had enjoyed a $300,000 meal in January.

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the guest was Smith, citing an anonymous source who attended the private feast at the Bellagio casino’s Prime Steakhouse.


MGM spokesman Clark Dumont told Bloomberg in an e-mail that it was a party of 12. But one of the guests at the dinner estimated it to be a party of closer to 25.

The majority of the bill was spent on wine, with some bottles costing $20,000, Dumont said.

Smith was in town attending the Consumer Electronics Show, and had a very successful run at the blackjack table prior to the meal.

David Carr, the New York Times columnist who died unexpectedly last week at age 58, hinted at Smith’s hot hand in a pair of tweets last month.



“No brainer quiz,” Carr tweeted. “What media co exec did I watch win $100k at blackjack last nite? Hint: gambling not his only vice.”

Carr and Smith famously clashed when Carr interviewed some Vice execs for the 2011 documentary, “Page One.”

The legendary New York Times media critic put Smith in his place when Smith criticized the Times for what he thought was a lack of coverage in genocide-stricken areas like Africa.


“Before you ever went there, we've had reporters there reporting on genocide after genocide,” Carr told Smith. “Just because you put on a f***ing safari helmet and looked at some poop doesn't give you the right to insult what we do.”

In May, a Gawker report accused Vice of paying its employees lowly wages, citing salary numbers provided by anonymous former Vice staffers.

""A company as successful as Vice should be paying decent wages. Vice doesn't,"" the report said. ""The company pays shitty wages to low-level employees, compensating them instead with the sheer coolness of working for Vice Media.""

Dan Olsen, 48, who last played a PGA Tour event at the 2011 PGA Championship, told 730AM The Game in Lansing, Mich., on Friday that ""I heard he's on a month's suspension ... it's kind of a strong witness. It's a credible person who is telling me this.''

[+] EnlargeTiger Woods

Both the PGA Tour and Tiger Woods' agent have emphatically denied claims that he has been suspended for a month by the Tour.
Olsen, who played only one full season on the PGA Tour (2004), said an exempt tour player told him, but he would not disclose the player and couldn't say he fully believed him. He also told ESPN.com's Michael Collins on Monday that the information he got about the suspension was not first-hand.

""It's not testosterone, but it's something else,'' Olsen said. ""I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.''

Olsen also talked about Woods using a ""cheater ball,'' referring to the Nike golf ball he plays, and that those allegations were potentially more damaging than the suspension.

""I'll be looked at as just some crazy f--- nobody making accusations about Tiger,'' Olsen told ESPN.com.

Ty Votaw, the executive vice president of the PGA Tour, denied any of the claims brought forth by Olsen. 

""There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,"" Votaw said. ""We categorically deny these allegations.''

The Tour almost never comments on disciplinary matters.

Woods said on Feb. 11 that he was taking a break to deal with the issues in his game after withdrawing during the first round last month of the Farmers Insurance Open.

""Over the past year, Woods has withdrawn with an injury three times and now fallen outside of the 70 in the world.

""These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,'' said Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, in a statement. ""They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.''

If Woods failed a test for performance drugs, the PGA Tour has said it is required to announce a suspension. And it would undoubtedly be for more than a month. If he failed a test for some sort of recreational substance, the tour's policy is not to disclose any penalties.

But if the transgression were severe, a month penalty would seem minor.

""They're not even going to remember the women,'' Olsen said, referring to the personal scandal Woods endured in 2009 which led to a divorce from his wife. ""The women are going to take a distance second place. You're gonna talk about him with Lance Armstrong.''

The PGA Tour began testing for performance enhancing drugs in 2008 and Woods has been randomly tested like other players. Only two players have run afoul of the drug testing guidelines and both were suspended for a year.

Olsen tied for 12th at Tucson in 2004, one of only eight cuts that he made in 31 PGA Tour starts that season. He also played the Web.com Tour in 2006, finishing with two top-10s in 27 events.",unrelated
772,ISIS pays tribute to its 'Cub of Baghdadi' child soldier,"Canadian national and former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier Gill Rosenberg, 31, revealed to the Israeli media earlier this month that she had traveled to Iraq to help the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) fight off ISIS.
""They are our brothers,"" she told Israel Radio of the Kurds. ""They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really.""
Now, just three weeks later, there are rumors she may be in ISIS custody. Posts on ISIS-affiliated web forums, including Al Platform Media, claim the ""Zionist soldier"" was captured while fighting with the Kurds against ISIS in Kobane, a small majority-Kurdish town along Syria's northern border with Turkey.
There has indeed been intense fighting in Kobane between ISIS and the YPG over the past 24 hours. However, YPG sources have strongly denied to the Journal and other outlets that Rosenberg was captured.
So far, neither group has provided evidence either way, and ISIS has yet to release an official statement.

A spokesperson at the IDF news desk told the Journal that the IDF is not keeping track of Rosenberg, and ""does not have a way of knowing"" if she's been captured by ISIS. Minister of Defense Moshe Ya'alon, too, told Channel 2 that he had no information on Rosenberg's whereabouts.
Rosenberg, formerly a resident of Tel Aviv, did post to Facebook on Nov. 20 that she would be taking a short leave from social media.
""My Facebook account and friend requests are being managed by someone else until I have access again in apx 2 weeks time on or around week of 12/8,"" she wrote. ""Please do not message as this is not me. Thank you.""
A couple weeks before that, right around her 31st birthday, Rosenberg posted photos of herself on the Iraqi-Syrian border, and wrote: ""In the IDF, we say אחריי - After Me. Let's show ISIS what that means.""
 

 

 
A friend of hers from the IDF told the Journal that he remembered Rosenberg as ""a cute lady with a strong ideology."" On Twitter, her tagline is: ""On a spiritual journey and a quest for authenticity.""
Her attraction to foreign battlgrounds aside, the IDF-turned-YPG warrior has a pretty bizarre backstory. She reportedly served a few years in U.S. prison for a phone scam that she ran out of Israel, in which elderly Americans were ""bilked out of millions of dollars, collectively,"" according to the FBI.
Since news of her possible capture broke, friends and supporters have filled her Facebook wall with respects, prayers and side-by-side photos of the Israeli and Kurdish flags.

ISIS members writing on the Al Platform Media forum urged leaders to use Rosenberg as a bargaining chip for a prisoner exchange with Israel.
In a phone interview with the Journal, Emmanuel Nachshon, spokesman for the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, distanced the government from Rosenberg. ""She’s her own person,"" he said. ""As an individual, she’s free to do whatever she wants. We're not in a position to tell her what to do. ... Remember, she didn’t go there as an Israeli. She never said, 'I’m representing Israel.'""
Nachshon said the foreign ministry was aware Rosenberg was fighting for the Kurds, but has not been able to confirm the kidnapping rumors. ""Our researchers are looking into it,"" he said. (CBC News in Canada reports that the Canadian foreign ministry is likewise ""pursuing all appropriate channels"" to locate Rosenberg.)
Asked if Israel was expecting ISIS to try and negotiate, Nachshon said: ""I hear they are more in the business of cutting heads.""

Now, along with two friends, Mohammed plans to launch his own hedge fund in June, when he turns 18 and can officially get his broker-dealer license. The trio also plan to go to college next year, but they’re not worried about Psych 101 getting in the way of their ultimate goal: $1 billion. “By next year!” said pal Damir Tulemaganbetov. “But it’s not just about money. We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers …”

Damir likened Mohammed to “Wolf of Wall Street” anti-hero Jordan Belfort, who, coincidentally, also got his start in penny stocks. After a cousin showed Mohammed how to trade the stocks, the teen got hooked on it, but got spooked after losing a bunch of money he’d made tutoring… as a 9 year-old.

“I had been paralyzed by my loss,” said Mohammed, who went on to study hedge fund managers and try to learn their secrets. He graduated to trading oil and gold and while he wouldn’t confirm the widely reported $72 million figure, Islam said his net worth is in the “high eight figures.”

Islamic State militants on Tuesday released a video that purported to show the beheading of James Foley, an American freelance journalist who has been missing since he was kidnapped in Syria in November 2012.

The authenticity of the video could not be immediately verified.

When contacted by Mashable, NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said, “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

The video opens with a clip of President Barack Obama's remarks announcing the launch of airstrikes on Islamic State positions near Erbil in northern Iraq. A black screen then shows the text, ""A message to America,"" and then Foley appears kneeling in a desert landscape, wearing an orange jumpsuit with a microphone attached. A hooded man wearing all-black clothes and tan military boots is standing behind him with a gun in a leather holster.

""I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,"" Foley says, among other things, in remarks seemingly prepared for him by his captors.

The video then switches to the man in black, who is now holding a serrated knife.

""This is James Wright Foley — an American citizen of your country,"" the man says in British-accented English. ""As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards Islamic State.... Effectively, any aggression towards the Islamic State is an aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership. So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the safety of Muslims living under the safety of the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""

The man then beheads Foley, using the knife as the video fades to black. After a shot of Foley's lifeless body and decapitated head, the video switches to the executioner now standing behind another man in an orange jumpsuit, identified in text on the screen as Steven Joel Sotloff.

""The life of this American prisoner, Obama, depends on your next decision.""

Sotloff, an American freelance journalist who had been working for Time magazine among other publications, was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border on Aug. 4, 2013.

The video then goes black.

The video was first reported by Zaid Benjamin, a reporter for the Arabic-language Radio Sawa, who said that it came from Furqan Media, the official outlet for the Islamic State. (Twitter suspended — then reinstated — the account.)

The video appeared to surface first on the Twitter account @mujahid4life, belonging to someone who described himself in his Twitter bio as 19 years old, ""anti-democracy. Loyal to the Caliphate. Harsh on kuffar. #Revert""

It didn't take long before people who had worked with Foley began reacting on Twitter.

I was w/ James Foley in Aleppo, August 2012 for a day in #Selahaddin. Syrian opposition members were adoring him. He was a kind, brave man

My thoughts are with James Foley’s family. No matter what he faced, he was unfailingly kind, generous, and warm. A wonderful soul.

There was also anger on Twitter that YouTube didn't immediately take down the video.

It's lucky that video didn't have a unlicensed Katy Perry song as a soundtrack or it would've been deleted from YouTube in seconds.

However, within an hour of the first report of the beheading, the video was taken down.

Images from the video are below, showing Foley before his execution and Sotloff being threatened:

Shortly after the clip appeared on the web, journalists and observers who watch the region began tweeting a hashtag — #ISISmediaBlackout — pledging to stop sharing Islamic State propaganda.

""You know what I think? And I know how crazy this sounds, but we need an #ISISmediaBlackout. Amputate their reach. Pour water on their flame,"" said a Tumblr blogger known as LibyaLiberty on Twitter in what appeared to be the first mention of the hashtag. ""From here on out, I won't share any photo or video of violence intentionally recorded & released by ISIS for propaganda,"" she tweeted. Many others, promptly, joined her pledge.

A statement from a group called Free James Foley said: ""We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.""

Post by Free James Foley.

Foley's parents appeared on the Today show last year, pleading for his release.

UPDATED 8:28 p.m. ET: GlobalPost CEO Philip Balboni released a statement Tuesday about the video that purportedly shows the beheading of journalist James Foley.

""On behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jim’s possible execution first broke. We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic,"" Balboni said.

“Although GlobalPost’s investigation at one point led us to believe that James was being held by the Syrian government, we later were given strong reason to believe he was being held by Islamic rebels in Syria,"" he added. ""We withheld this information at the request of the family and on the advice of authorities cooperating in the effort to protect Jim. GlobalPost, working with a private security company, has amassed an enormous amount of information that has not been made public.”

Foley reported in Syria for GlobalPost as a freelancer.

778,Boko Haram 'ceasefire' doubts after attacks reported in Nigeria,"More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in April, sparking the #BringBackOurGirls campaign

A top military official in Nigeria was reported Friday to have announced a cease-fire between the government and the military group Boko Haram, igniting both skepticism and hopes that more than 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped in April would be released.

The truce was said to be announced by Air Marshall Alex Badeh, Nigeria’s chief of defense, the Associated Press reports. The release of the girls is still being negotiated, Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade added, but the cease-fire would begin immediately and could take take several days to reach the groups of militants.

“Already, the terrorists have announced a cease-fire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a cease-fire,” said Mike Omeri, a government spokesman on Boko Haram, at a news conference. The AP adds that Omeri confirmed negotiations about the girls’ potential release were held throughout the week.

Reports of the deal were met with hesitation by those who have followed the saga since the girls were abducted from their school in Chibok on April 14. There was neither an official statement quickly released by the government, nor an announcement made by the insurgent group, the New York Times reports.

Boko Haram, which released a video in May that claimed responsibility for the girls’ abductions and vowed to “sell them on the market, by Allah,” has previously demanded the release of rebel prisoners in exchange for their freedom. But Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who has faced intense global pressure to free the students, said that’s a trade he will not make. The Nigerian government has in the past misled the public about the girls’ status; its fight against Boko Haram has been fraught with challenges since the militant group rose up in 2009, from inefficiency and corruption in the military to lax local support in the northern communities that are threatened most.

In August, the Wall Street Journal reported that American surveillance planes spotted groups that appeared to be the missing girls, suggesting that not all of them had been sold into marriage or slavery — as feared — and that some were perhaps being kept as a bargaining tactic.",discuss
779,Wife and son of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi detained in Lebanon,"A homeless man was given a hundred dollars, and what he did will make you cry. YouTube channel owner Josh Paler Lin decided to see it for himself and capture it all on camera.

Normally when you think of the homeless, you probably picture some drug or alcohol addict who is only taking money from passerby to support their next fix. Some of them even make more money than the average full-time employee working legally just because they’re good actors with bad clothes and not homeless at all.

Instead of assuming the worst, Josh put his money into finding the truth. He started the video asking the audience a question and explaining his idea.

“When you give homeless people money, do you ever wonder how they spent it? Today I’m going to give a homeless guy a hundred dollars, and I’m going to follow him and see how he spent it.”

Josh approached a homeless man at an intersection holding up one of the usual cardboard signs asking for help, and begins a conversation with the man. As Josh hands the man the hundred dollars, he tears up at the generosity, telling him plainly that nobody’s ever given him that much.

Josh then left the intersection as the camera remained trained on the man. As expected, the first place he went was a liquor store, but if you watch what happens, it’s not what you’re probably thinking. Coming out with a few things in bags, he made his way to the park and started handing food and other items to the homeless people there.

— David Jones (@_dpaj) December 23, 2014

After witnessing this twice, Josh approached the homeless man and told him that what he saw really touched him. He confessed that he had the man followed to see what he would do, and had his doubts initially. The man told Josh that some of the homeless are just people who fell on hard luck, and he told him his story.

To reward the man for his generosity paid forward, Josh gave him another hundred dollars.

Does this change how you think about the homeless?

Justice K Kannan of the High Court passed the order on a petition filed by Hansraj Chauhan, a former follower of the Dera.

In his petition, Chauhan had claimed that he along with around 400 saints of 'dera' were castrated inside the ashram, Chauhan's counsel Navkiran Singh said.

Chauhan said in the petition that they were assured that those who would get castrated will be able to meet God through the dera head.

Taking cognizance of the petition, the HC had earlier ordered medical examination of petitioner Chuahan from the government multi-specialty hospital (GMSH) at Sector-16, Chandigarh.

The GMSH authorities examined Chauhan and found that he has been castrated, Singh said.

Seeking a CBI probe, Chauhan has also claimed before the High Court that castration process of dera followers is being done by Gurmeet Ram Rahim through doctors are employed in his hospital.

Besides, in a report submitted before the High Court, the state government said that it has recorded the statements of seven persons, associated with the dera head, in which all of them have confirmed that they have been castrated, Singh said.

The dera chief, who is going to hit the big screen next month with his film 'Messenger of God (MSG)', has already courted controversy with Sikh organisations, including Akal Takht, seeking a ban on it.

""Jobs"" is based on Walter Isaacson's wildly successful biography of the late Apple cofounder, ""Steve Jobs.""

783,Tiger Woods selling Swedish villa — island included,"Years ago, I had a job in China where I evaluated the spoken English of college students. One bright young woman introduced herself to me with her Chinese name. Then she added: ""You can call me 'Easy.' That's my English name.""

I paused, thought for a moment, and then decided to say something. ""You might want to consider changing your name,"" I said, explaining—as delicately as possible—that ""easy"" was an unfortunate name for a woman. Mortified, she thanked me for the tip. ""I'm going to go and change my name now,"" she said.

People in China have adopted English names for decades. Many choose ones that resemble their birth names: Chinese boys named ""Da Wei,"" a common name, almost invariably become ""David."" Others find inspiration from singers, athletes, politicians, or movie stars. In my first year in China, I taught five different boys called ""Tom Hanks,"" thanks in part to Castaway's success.

Most of the ""English"" names I encountered were conventional, though others—like the aforementioned ""Easy""—were less than appropriate. (I also taught a boy named ""Fish"" who, perhaps inspired by a certain musical artist, preferred to render his name by drawing it.)

Sweets-inspired names are ""typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.""
CCTV, China's state-run broadcaster, wants to solve this problem. In an article published by its English-language channel, the network laid out a series of guidelines for how not to name yourself. For example, avoid naming yourself after a food item (""Candy""), a famous person (""Obama""), or a very old person (""Gertrude""). If you name yourself ""Satan,"" says CCTV, people might think you're anti-Christian, or worse, a ""member of a heavy metal band."" Proper and traditional names, like ""Michael,"" ""William,"" and ""Elizabeth,"" on the other hand, imply you're from a fancy and conservative family. Sweets-inspired names are ""typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.""

One wonders if certain American celebrities might not also benefit from these guidelines. For instance, here's what CCTV has to say about using food as a name:

""Food is very hit or miss. And usually miss. One of the issues here is that food names can be 'very' suggestive.""

Amazon (sort of) offers limited ad-supported streaming now, by letting non-Prime users watch a limited selection of Prime shows with commercial breaks.

Christian Bale is back in line to play Steve Jobs in a new biopic about the Apple co-founder after Leonardo DiCaprio backed out in order to take a break from acting.

The film industry magazine Variety reports that Bale will take the lead in the film Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin, scriptwriter of The Social Network and The West Wing.

Based on Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs: the Exclusive Biography, the film will be divided into three long scenes taking place in real time, each set on the eve of a product launch. Sorkin has revealed that the products are the Mac in 1984; the NeXT computer Jobs launched in 1990 after leaving Apple; and the iPod, which launched 2001.

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, as he stood guard at the War Memorial on Wednesday morning.

Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, then ran inside the Parliament, where he opened fire before he was shot dead by the House of Commons Sergeant-at-Arms.

And now, we have our first look at Zehaf-Bibeau in a photo that shows him holding a gun and wearing a keffiyeh.

Scroll down for videos

Gunman: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the Muslim convert who shot dead solider Nathan Cirillo and opened fire on Canadian Parliament

Final moments: Cirillo (left) is pictured guarding the National War Memorial just minutes before he was shot

Zehaf-Bibeau was born in Quebec as Michael Joseph Hall.

A criminal court database shows a man with the same name was arrested five times while living in Montreal.

Zehaf-Bibeau was charged in February 2004 for possession of marijuana and possession of PCP. He pleaded guilty to both charges in December 2004, serving one day in prison for marijuana possession and 60 days for PCP possession.

He also spent a day in jail in March of 2004 for a parole violation and was again convicted of marijuana possession in 2009, reports Global News.

In 2011, he was charged with robbery in Vancouver but served only one day in prison after he pleaded guilty to the lesser included offence of uttering threats. and was credited with 66 days in pre-trial custody.

Sources told the Globe and Mail that he had been designated a 'high-risk traveler' and the government had seized his passport

His attack comes just two days after another Canadian soldier was killed in Quebec by a man with jihadist sympathies.

Authorities initially said they believed 'two or three' gunmen were responsible for the attack in Ottawa on Wednesday, but at an afternoon press conference, Chief of Police Charles Bordeleau would not confirm whether or not they are still searching for other shooters.

'We're still in the process of clearing Parliament Hill,' he said. 'It is a slow and methodical process.'

The shooting spree began at 9.52am when witnesses reported seeing a gunman climb out of a car, grab a rifle, shoot the soldier in the abdomen and then run towards Parliament.

Corporal Cirillo was rushed to hospital but later succumbed to his injuries.

Cirillo, a fitness fanatic and animal lover with a young son, was a reservist serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in Hamilton.

'Nathan was a good man,' friend Marie Michele told CBC News. 'He would give anything to anyone.'

Ottawa police then received a call at 9.54am that shots had been heard inside the Parliament, while journalists cowering inside said they heard dozens of rounds and could smell gunpowder in the halls.

A shootout unfolded and Zehaf-Bibeau was killed by Sergeant-At-Arms Kevin Vickers, who worked for the RCMP for 29 years before joining the Parliament in 2006. (He is pictured by the Hill Times.)

'I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe,' said Julian Fantino, Canada's Minister of Veterans Affairs, on Twitter.

The Sergeant-at-Arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons and providing safety and security of the Parliament buildings and the people inside.

As gunfire erupted in the hallways, journalists and politicians scrambled for safety, while members in the Conservative Party caucus room blocked the door with a stack of chairs.

A parliamentary guard was shot in the leg during the gunfight but is recovering in hospital, according to Globe and Mail reporter Josh Wingrove, who is inside the building.

He had been scheduled to give Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai, co-winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, her Canadian citizenship today.

The government said there is not yet any evidence that Zehaf-Bibeau has any ties to violent Islamic extremism but noted that it is still early in the investigation.

An Ottawa Citizen reporter inside the Parliament building, Jordan Press, wrote on Twitter that a suspect was '5'9-5'10, overweight & wearing a dark jacket'.

Witnesses also told the Citizen that they saw a man wearing an 'Arabic scarf' and carrying a long rifle, while others said the suspect looked South American.

Reporter Jordan Press added that the car - a Toyota Corolla - was parked in front of the building with its engine still running.

A video shot by a Globe and Mail reporter showed RCMP officers moving through Parliament's main hall toward the Parliamentary library, as the hallway echoed with gunfire.

He went on: 'I was in the west wing of the building and shooter appears to have entered through main door on south side, heading north along hallway.

'I heard dozens of gunshots and the smell of gunpowder is heavy in the hallways right now.'

He added: 'One security guard said that it appears one officer may have been shot but we have no way to confirm that.'

Speaking to CNN, Wingrove said it appeared Zehaf-Bibeau entered the front entrance that has 'many armed guards' but no metal detector'.

'If you flash your valid pass, they allow you to go in,' he said. 'This appears to be the entry point [of the gunman] based on witness accounts.'

The Lede: Investigation Suggests American Journalist Missing in Syria Is ‘Likely’ Held by GovernmentMAY 3, 2013
Titled “A Message to America,” the video shows the journalist kneeling in a desert landscape, clad in an orange jumpsuit — an apparent reference to the uniforms worn by prisoners at the American military detention camp in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Standing to his left is a masked ISIS fighter, who begins speaking in English, with what sounds like an East London accent. Pulling out a knife, he says that Mr. Foley’s execution is in retaliation for the recent American airstrikes ordered by President Obama against the extremist group in Iraq.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers — the U.S. government — for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” Mr. Foley says in the video, which was uploaded to the online account of the al-Furqan Media Foundation, according to SITE, an organization that follows jihadist groups. He ends saying that when American soldiers began dropping bombs on Iraq this month, “they signed my death certificate.”

On Tuesday night, Mr. Foley’s mother, Diane Foley, issued a statement on the Facebook page the family had created to publicize their son’s disappearance: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people. We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”

Two weeks ago, in the wake of American-led airstrikes against the terrorist group, which was fanning out across Iraq, jihadists had taken to social media to call for attacks on American interests. In the three hours after the graphic video of Mr. Foley’s beheading was uploaded on YouTube, jihadists using the hashtag “#NewMessageFromISIStoUS” surpassed 2,000 tweets, according to a survey by SITE, with many fighters gloating over his death, and calling it just retribution for the air raids.

Mr. Foley, 40, a freelance journalist who was working for GlobalPost, an online publication based in Boston, as well as for Agence France-Presse, disappeared in Syria on Nov. 22, 2012. He was held alongside several other Americans, whose families have asked for a news blackout.

The video concludes with the fighter threatening to kill Steven Sotloff, another American freelance journalist, who was being held alongside Mr. Foley. Mr. Sotloff is seen kneeling in the same position, in the same landscape and wearing the same style of orange-colored jumpsuit. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the fighter says.

Mr. Obama was briefed about the video by Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, on Air Force One as he returned to Martha’s Vineyard, according to Eric Schultz, the deputy White House press secretary.

In Washington, a National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, said in a statement: “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist,” she said, using an alternative name for ISIS.

Reached by telephone, Philip Balboni, the chief executive and a founder of GlobalPost, said that the newsroom and Mr. Foley’s family were also trying to establish the veracity of the footage. “We are still evaluating the video at this time,” he said.

Mr. Foley, who was last seen in Binesh, Syria, was also abducted in Libya in 2011, where he was held for several weeks after running into troops loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s crumbling government.

He was among dozens of journalists — many of them freelancers without the formal backing of a news organization — who disappeared in 2012 and 2013 in Syria.

788,"Video showing American journalist beheaded believed real, officials and family say","Mayor de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton were expected to announce the change Monday, but reaction to the new policy has been mixed ahead of the press conference.

The NYPD’s old strategy for combating pot possession is going up in smoke.

In a historic change, city cops will stop arresting people on low-level marijuana charges and issue tickets instead, various police and other sources said Monday.

Persons caught smoking on the street would still wind up in the pokey, they said. But someone caught with a small amount of reefer would be slapped with a summons.

The new policy is expected to be formally announced later Monday by Mayor de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton at an afternoon press conference, but already law enforcement and reformers were weighing in — both for and against the new rule.

“This should free up police manpower to pursue cases of greater magnitude while relieving some of the congestion in the courts,” Richmond County District Attorney Daniel Donovan said in support.

The Drug Policy Alliance said it was “cautiously optimistic” about the new NYPD policy.

“Most of those arrested are young men of color, even though young white men use marijuana at higher rates,” the group said in a statement.

Richard Aborn of the Citizens Crime Commission said the new rule will have the long-lasting effect of making it easier for more young people to find legitimate employment.

“There’s no criminal record,” he said. “You don’t have the stigma of a criminal record.”

“I think it’s sad,” countered Sergeants Benevolent Association President Ed Mullins. “I think this is the beginning of an avalanche. Basically, what he's doing is equating an illegal substance to a parking ticket.”

Pat Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said they want clarity from the top for their membership.

“Anything less will result in our members being held responsible for a failed policy by a discipline obsessed police department and the multiple levels of police oversight it has,” Lynch said in a statement. “We do not want police officers left holding the bag if crime rises because of poor policy.”

Sam Pirozzolo, vice-president of the NYC Parents Union, said the new NYPD rule “sends a very mixed message to our children.”

“It’s saying that it's OK to smoke marijuana because it's now less of a crime, but overall we know drugs are harmful,"" said Pirozzolo, whose daughter is a ninth-grader at Susan Wagner High School in Staten Island.

As it is, misdemeanor marijuana arrests are down citywide in the first 10 months of the year — about 24,000 compared to 29,000 last year.

There has been a growing pressure on law enforcement to curb arrests for small amounts of pot because they are disproportionately made in black and Hispanic communities.

According to the Marijuana Arrest Research Project, blacks and Hispanics represented 86% of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city in the first eight months of the year.

The new NYPD policy was embraced by Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson during his 2013 campaign for office. He promised to fine those arrested with small amounts of marijuana rather than put them in cuffs and charge them.

""Too many young people are being arrested for low-level drug charges that leave a permanent stain on their records for what should be a violation,"" Thompson has said.

The de Blasio administration has been slow to embrace that strategy, but Bratton has spoken recently about handling some minor criminal offenses without making arrests.

Bratton and the NYPD’s policy of aggressively targeting low-level crime has come under criticism in the wake of Eric Garner’s death from a police chokehold after he was arrested for selling untaxed cigarettes.

Critics say it’s main flaw is that it pits the police against minorities, who wind up being the chief targets of the strategy.

789,"No, Saudi TV Didn't Blur Out Michelle Obama's Face When the President Met King Salman","HAVANA (AP) — Social media around the world have been flooded with rumors of Fidel Castro's death, but there was no sign Friday that the reports were true, even if the 88-year-old former Cuban leader has not been seen in public for months.

Similar speculation has swept across Cuban expatriate communities repeatedly over the decades, particularly after a serious illness forced him to step down from duties as president in 2006, handing over leadership to his younger brother Raul.

The new wave was prompted in part by Fidel Castro's failure to comment after the U.S. and Cuba declared on Dec. 17 that they would move to restore full diplomatic relations broken a half century ago.

The chatter appeared to pick up when some media noted Thursday that Castro had not been seen in public in a year. He last appeared on Jan. 8, 2014, at an art exhibition in Havana, ending nine months out of public view.

The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Aug. 21. He was also photographed with the Chinese and Russian presidents in July. Castrowas last heard from on Oct. 18, when he published an editorial about Ebola.

By Friday, Cuba-related Twitter accounts were ablaze with speculation, fueled in large part by reports on news websites such as Diario de Cuba and Diario las Americas that Cuba had scheduled a news conference, possibly to discuss Castro's health.

The rumors were further stoked when respected Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported on its website that Castro had died. It quickly pulled the report back, however.

Cuban officials told news media in Havana that no press conference had been called, and there were no obvious signs of official preparations for mourning.

790,Isis militants claim to have killed US journalist James Foley,"THIS is the terrible moment a desperately poor young woman tries to sell her son – to fund life-saving treatment for her daughter.

Mum Meng Xiangyan faced a real-life Sophie's Choice when poverty forced her to decide between her twins.

The distraught 29-year-old said that she and her husband loved both of their children.

But with certain death awaiting their daughter unless they could get medical treatment, they were prepared to sell their son to a good home so that both would have a chance of life.

Pictures published in local media show her standing on Weihai Road in Qingdao, which is a major city in eastern Shandong Province, Eastern China, with a placard offering to sell him to the highest bidder.

He was eating what appeared to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appealed for someone to come forward and buy the boy.

She said: ""Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

""But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukaemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives. It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.""

Medics say that the child is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital.

The family have sold up their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10 square metre flat close to where the therapies are being carried out. The parents are also struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal.

So far, there have been no offers on their son, who has not been named.

Their desperation follows on from a similar recent story in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband, Zhou Xinggui, are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter.

His wife's sign read: ""Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to sell my daughter and save my husband.""

In the four hours she sat with the sign, no-one bought her daughter.",unrelated
791,Anyone for dog meat soup? Kim Jong-Un considers opening restaurant in Scotland selling North Korean delicacies,"WATCHERS of North Korea's secretive regime believe it could be planning another surprise move, a restaurant in Scotland.

The Cambodia eaterie
Leader Kim Jong-Un has already opened a diner in Amsterdam, with the 'Pyongyang' chain of restaurants also having branches in China and parts of Asia.

It has been reported that the dictator is believed to be interested in opening another in the UK, with claims by observers of North Korea that Kim is especially keen on an eaterie in Scotland.

His fondness of whisky and the profile of Scotland's referendum have been cited as key reasons for the potential serving of North Korean delicacies such as dog meat soup and pine-nut gruel in Scotland.

Proceeds from the 'Pyongyang' chain are funnelled back into North Korean government funds.

Michael Madden, editor of North Korea Leadership Watch, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries, especially those with left-wing leanings.

He said: ""It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean's elite's thoughts.

""Despite voting no they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable than England, plus North Koreans love whisky.

""Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.""

792,"Nigeria, Boko Haram reach ceasefire deal, kidnapped girls to go free, official says","A year before North Korean leader Kim Jong-un came to power, a directive was issued for anyone sharing his name to change it – maintaining a tradition upheld by the reclusive state’s ruling Kim dynasty, a report said.

An internal state document obtained by South Korea’s KBS TV station contains an “administrative order” from then leader Kim Jong-il for all party, army and police officials to ensure the directive was carried out. The order was issued in January 2011, shortly after Kim Jong-un had been anointed as his father’s successor. Kim Jong-il died in December of the same year.

“All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-un … and train them to voluntarily change their names,” said the document, extracts of which were aired by KBS on Tuesday.

The process involved revising names on official documents, including social security cards and school diplomas. Officials were also directed to reject birth certificates for any newborns named Kim Jong-un.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip … regarding this project,” it added.

The authenticity of the official directive could not be independently verified, and Seoul’s unification ministry declined to comment on whether it was genuine.

But one government official noted that the Pyongyang regime was known to have banned citizens sharing the names of founding president Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il.

“Given the North maintained the policy under the two previous leaders, there is a possibility that it would continue to do so now,” the official said.

The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea for more than six decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult.

Park Jin-hee, a North Korean defector working for KBS who obtained the document, said she was sure the 2011 directive had been effectively enforced.

“There is no one in the North named Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-un,” Park, who defected in 2008, said.",unrelated
793,Kim Jong-Un's sister reportedly running N. Korea,"Vice Media CEO and co-founder Shane Smith, whose billion-dollar company was accused of underpaying its employees earlier this year, spent $300,000 on dinner at a Las Vegas hotel last month.
MGM Resorts International revealed on an earnings call Tuesday that unidentified guests had enjoyed a $300,000 meal in January.

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the guest was Smith, citing an anonymous source who attended the private feast at the Bellagio casino’s Prime Steakhouse.


MGM spokesman Clark Dumont told Bloomberg in an e-mail that it was a party of 12. But one of the guests at the dinner estimated it to be a party of closer to 25.

The majority of the bill was spent on wine, with some bottles costing $20,000, Dumont said.

Smith was in town attending the Consumer Electronics Show, and had a very successful run at the blackjack table prior to the meal.

David Carr, the New York Times columnist who died unexpectedly last week at age 58, hinted at Smith’s hot hand in a pair of tweets last month.



“No brainer quiz,” Carr tweeted. “What media co exec did I watch win $100k at blackjack last nite? Hint: gambling not his only vice.”

Carr and Smith famously clashed when Carr interviewed some Vice execs for the 2011 documentary, “Page One.”

The legendary New York Times media critic put Smith in his place when Smith criticized the Times for what he thought was a lack of coverage in genocide-stricken areas like Africa.


“Before you ever went there, we've had reporters there reporting on genocide after genocide,” Carr told Smith. “Just because you put on a f***ing safari helmet and looked at some poop doesn't give you the right to insult what we do.”

In May, a Gawker report accused Vice of paying its employees lowly wages, citing salary numbers provided by anonymous former Vice staffers.

""A company as successful as Vice should be paying decent wages. Vice doesn't,"" the report said. ""The company pays shitty wages to low-level employees, compensating them instead with the sheer coolness of working for Vice Media.""

Vice responded to the allegations by pointing out that former Gawker interns had brought a class-action lawsuit against the company’s founder, Nick Denton, for allegedly violating federal wage laws.

Then, at the Vice company holiday party in December, Smith gave each full-time employee an envelope with $1,500 cash inside, amounting to $1 million total, Business Insider reported.

795,MPs credit sergeant-at-arms for saving lives in Parliament Hill shootings,"He’s being called a hero for shooting a rampaging gunman dead on Parliament Hill — and it may mark the first time Sergeant-At-Arms Kevin Vickers has ever fired a gun in the line of duty.

“This the first time in his career that he’s shot anyone,” said Erin, Vickers’ niece.

A retired RCMP officer who once served in Calgary, 58-year-old Vickers is known to most Canadians as the symbol of order at the House of Commons: a grey-haired man in a black hat and robes, often carrying the ceremonial sceptre of Canada over his shoulder.

On Tuesday, Vickers reportedly showed just how serious his role really is, the head of security for Canada’s government killing a gunman who charged into the Centre Block on Parliament Hill.

“To all in Ottawa, stay safe & strong. Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes…” Tweeted Minister Peter MacKay.

Julian Fantino, Canada’s Minister of Veterans Affairs, added his own Tweet of gratitude.

“I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.”

After the shooting, Vickers immediately contacted his family in New Brunswick to tell them he is safe — “I’m doing okay,” he said — but that hasn’t stopped them worrying about the emotional trauma that will follow, having being forced to pull the trigger for the first time.

“We’re always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him — he had to make a very serious decision today,” said Mary, Vicker’s older sister.

“He’s always a natural leader — he would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can’t stress that enough — but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.”

Raw footage of the Centre Block attack show officers and guards moving cautiously down the hall, before gunfire suddenly erupts, with dozens of shots echoing in the distance.

Various witnesses have credited Vickers with leading the security response and killing the infiltrator, a man who may have been the same cold-blooded murderer who gunned down an unarmed solider outside the national cenotaph moments before.

Anyone who thought Canada’s Sergeant-At-Arms role was an archaic novelty now understands the man holding the sceptre has a deadly serious job.

“It’s not ceremonial at all, and he has tremendous responsibility — and he wears it well,” said Mary.

In an RCMP career spanning 29 years, Vickers rose up the ranks from a constable in the Northwest Territories to serving ten years in Alberta, and then to chief superintendent in Ottawa.

After retiring from the force, he took the Sergeant-At-Arms job on Parliament Hill, and was once famously photographed escorting a protestor masquerading as a page from the House of Commons.

His niece Erin says her uncle is a calm, gentle man — but someone who handles pressure with utmost calm.

“He’s a thoughtful and considerate person — he’s halfway to a saint in my opinion,” she said.

“He’s a very capable human being.”

It’s already gotten so bad that editor-in-chief Anna Wintour is wary of entering her personal office. Over the next three days, two other outlets reported even grosser details. You might want to sit down.

Radar, for example, said that the rats are actively shitting on staffers’ desks and other belongings:

According to insiders, the pesky rodents have invaded the infamous accessories closet and made their presence known by leaving droppings on desks, computers, and pricey couture! ... “The famed accessories closet, which was being put together with the designer wares from the old office, was taking shape when the rats got into it,” the source revealed. “There were droppings all over the floor, and some of the shoe boxes had been chewed into.”

People, meanwhile, suggested that the magazine’s employees are literally surrounded by rat droppings:

“It’s true,” an insider confirms to PEOPLE. “The girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It’s nasty.”

How did the rodents penetrate the fashion bible’s new office? Radar confirmed what we’ve heard from at least one other source: The rats let themselves in via 1WTC’s ventilation system:

“The rats appear to have gotten in via the venting, which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in,” the source explained. “Walls were being moved to accommodate last-minute design changes by Anna and Condé Nast, and it’s assumed this is how the rats got in.”

What we currently lack, however, are photos of the damage. So: are you a Vogue staffer affected by the current rat crisis? Send us an email. Anonymity guaranteed.

A photo posted to Twitter on Monday by the Ansar al-Deen Front, an Islamic extremist brigade seemingly comprised largely of Chechen fighters, shows the Ford F-250 with a militant standing in the bed firing the anti-aircraft gun.

Speaking to CBS News Tuesday morning, a representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said the vehicle was sold to the AutoNation dealership in Houston in Oct. 2013, and that's the last they knew of it.

The company has been besieged by phone calls -- including threats -- since the photo appeared online, clearly showing the company's name and phone number. CBS News is not identifying the company due to the nature of some of the attention it has received.

They have employed an attorney and intend to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo from the Internet.

Reached by CBS News Tuesday morning, a person identifying himself as a manager at AutoNation would not comment on the sale history of the vehicle in question, saying ""we can't give information like that over the phone,"" before hanging up the phone.

799,Doubts cast over Nicaragua meteorite claim,"The United States appears to now be flying unarmed surveillance drones over the IS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria. The pictures thus far suggest that the drone being used is the MQ-1 Reaper.

The two photos show the distinct downward facing V-shaped tail used on Predator drones, and the aircraft does not appear to be carrying any missiles. As such, the available evidence indicates that the drone is being used for surveillance purposes, rather than in a hunter-killer type mission.

According to local activists, the drone has been circling over the city for three hours. If the reports are true, this would suggest that the air environment over Raqqa is permissive. Drones are visible on radar and easy to shoot down with air defense systems.

The evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery – and possibly signals intelligence (SIGINT) — of Islamic State positions in the group’s most important stronghold. There is little doubt that this mission is intended to give U.S. policymakers more information about IS positions in Raqqa. However, it does not necessarily signal the imminent use of force against IS positions in Syria.

As of now, there is no information about where the drones are based. However, open-source information allows for some informed guesses.

The United States currently bases Predator drones in Turkey at Incirlik Air Force Base in Turkey. The three drones are routinely flown over Northern Iraq and data is shared in real time with the Turkish military.

A second possibility could be that the drones are being flown from Kuwait. Satellite imagery captured the deployment of U.S. drones at Ali Salem Air Base.

A third option is that the United States is now flying drones from an airbase in Iraqi Kurdistan.

A regional security expert also reports that Predator drones were seen operating in the civilian airport near Erbil.

800,Experts: More facts needed on purported audio recording of Michael Brown shooting,"Planetary Alignment On Jan 4, 2015 Will Decrease Gravity For 5 Minutes Causing Partial Weightlessness.

Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015.

According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.

Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.

Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun, within an arc 95° wide. But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earth’s crust is maximum even at their closest approach.

But don’t get too excited. If you think you’ll be able to float around your house, you’re wrong. But, if you jump in the air at 9:47 AM PST, on January 4, 2015, it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 0.2 seconds.

So, mark this date on your calendar and share it with your friends! Zero gravity day is just around the corner!",unrelated
801,CNN Plays Alleged Recording of Michael Brown Shooting,"Two of the nation’s leading experts on the use of deadly force by the police are warning against overreaction to an audio recording that purportedly captures the sound of the gunshots that killed Michael Brown.

The newly surfaced recording, which has not been publicly verified by investigators, was first broadcast by CNN.

On the 12-second clip, it is possible to hear a series of what appears to be quick pops, followed by a brief pause and then another succession of rapid shots. St. Louis attorney Lopa Blumenthal and her client, who wishes to remain anonymous to the public, took the recording to the FBI on Monday. Blumenthal says she counted 11 shots fired.

“There's that pause, which is what gave me pause, when I first saw it,” Blumenthal told Yahoo News. “It was a pause so there was time to think about it and deliberate. That doesn't mean that I'm saying it helps one side or the other. But I do know that in a 12-second tape, where eight seconds of it is a shooting, a three-second delay is a significant period of time.”

Ron Martinelli and Michael Levine, both longtime criminal justice consultants, told Yahoo News that the audio needs to be authenticated and considered with other evidence before its importance can be evaluated.

“Pauses may or may not be anything of tremendous significance,” said Martinelli, a retired officer and criminologist specializing in police practices. “The answer is: It depends. In the end, this is about a forensic reconciliation of statements and forensic facts and evidence.”

Levine, a retired DEA agent and law enforcement trainer, said that anyone willing to put a value on a recording before it has been corroborated is discrediting themselves.

“If they gave that opinion on a witness stand, they would be chewed up and spit out by any defense attorney, even a defense attorney that got his degree at Sears & Roebuck School of Law,” Levine said.

Blumenthal told Yahoo News that she has no qualms about bringing the recording forward.

“There's no bad evidence, there's just evidence,” Blumenthal said. “It doesn't take sides. It helps lead to where you are going and discover the truth. Every little bit helps.”

The potential new discovery comes to light more than two weeks after Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, in broad daylight in the middle of a residential street.

The audio was unwittingly captured by a man taping  an online web chat inside his apartment near the shooting scene.

On the recording, the unidentified Ferguson resident is heard complimenting a friend’s looks during a video chat, when two bursts of loud pops erupt in the background.

Blumenthal said her client heard the noise, but paid it no attention because gunshots are common in the neighborhood. The unidenitifed man, she said, had to be persuaded to come forward.

“Even after I talked to them about it, they were very dubious that it had any type of value,” Blumenthal said. “My client nor I are seeking any publicity or attention at all. There's no motivation to say it is what it's not.""

Blumenthal said she and her client were interviewed by FBI agents about the recording late Monday.

Federal and state investigators are conducting separate criminal and civil rights investigations into the controversial shooting.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has said Wilson was attempting to tell Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, to stop walking in the middle of the road, when the officer realized that the pair fit the description of suspects being sought in the theft of cigars from a nearby convenience store.

Chief Jackson said a scuffle ensued after the teen struck Wilson in the face and that a shot was fired inside the officer’s squad car as Brown attempted to grab the officer’s gun. But Johnson has told reporters that it was Wilson who was the aggressor, and that Brown never went for the weapon. Instead, Johnson says, the officer shot his friend while Brown was trying to flee but had stopped and put his hands up in surrender.

Wilson, 28, is on paid leave and has not spoken publicly about the shooting.

Blumenthal said her client gave a copy of the recording to federal investigators.

“(The FBI) thought this would be an important piece of the investigation,” she told CNN.

An FBI spokesperson declined to address the issue of the recording when contacted by Yahoo News on Tuesday.

FBI audio engineers are reportedly planning to analyze the recording for authenticity.

Mark O’Mara, the Florida attorney who successfully defended shooting suspect George Zimmerman, told CNN that while it may be too early judge the audio’s significance, the scientific review could unearth new evidence.

“I look forward to hearing if that tape has Mike Brown’s or Darren Wilson’s voice on it saying stop,” O’Mara said.

Separate autopsies performed on Brown revealed that he was struck at least six times, including by what was likely a fatal shot to the top of his head. Authorities have not disclosed how many times Wilson fired his weapon.
Veteran forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg listened to the recording on Tuesday.

“The gunshots are unmistakable,"" Ginsberg told Yahoo News.

By Ginsberg’s count, he said, there are 10 shots on the recording, but he said he could understand why an untrained ear might hear more.

“I can confidently say that I heard at least 10 shots,” said Ginsberg, who has worked on such major investigations as the Sandy Hook school shooting. “I'm hearing six shots, followed by very close to three seconds of pause, followed by four more shots.”

Messages sent to Ferguson police seeking information on the type of service weapon that it assigns to officers went unanswered on Tuesday. Levine said officers across the country commonly carry semi-automatic pistols with a capacity of 15 to 17 bullets.

Any potential pause in Wilson’s shooting would have to be weighed against statements given to investigators, Levine said.

Levine said the pause “would raise an alarm if I had qualified witness statements and the officer’s statement that conflicts with that.” He added, “But I don’t know what this officer’s official statement is here. I don’t think anyone does.”

802,Missing Mexican students 'not found in mass grave',"An image of a gold Bugatti Veyron graffitied with a drawing of a penis may have upset car lovers - but it turns out the vehicle was included in a YouTube hoax.

Photos from multiple Instagram accounts have revealed the luxury vehicle wasn't permanently damaged.

Instagram user @andreysmygov uploaded a photo last Friday of the Veyron with a caption that suggested it was painted on as a stunt for TwinzTV, Car Crushing noted.

Graffitied: A photo of the 'vandalised' Bugatti Veyron was reportedly taken in Seattle, according to a Reddit post

Busted: This Instagram photo from @andreysmygov included a caption suggesting the car was spray-painted as a stunt with TwinzTV

'How often do u get to spray paint on a Bugatti lol shoutout to the homie @vgtorious for letting us @twinztv1 @twinztv2 @twinz_tv @nigxl @alexwood66,' he wrote online.

Brothers Jeremy and Jason Holden run the YouTube pranks channel TwinzTV.

A Saturday photo @andreysmygov shows user @vgtorious standing next to the Veyron, this time with different graffiti.

Instead of a drawing of male genitalia, there is graffiti of the initials 'VG'

A Sunday photo from his account shows both @andreysmygov and @vgotorious leaning on a scrubbed-clean Veyron, suggesting the luxury vehicle no longer features any markings.

'Filming new vid with @vgtorious this one is going to be sick! #vgproductions #bugatti' @andreysmygov captioned the photograph.

A photo of the car being waxed - with no graffitti visible - was posted by @vgtorious to Instagram on Saturday, though it is not clear when that took place.

Different drawing: A second photo @andreysmygov's account shows different graffitti on the hood of the Veyron

He also re-grammed the photograph showing him next to the with the letters 'VG' on the hood, confirming the hoax.

'Oops I think we pranked the WORLD and the video hasn't aired...yet �� #bugatti #veyron #vw #youtube #global #news #pranks #funny #bugattifamilyimsorry', he captioned the snap.

Jeremy Holden also uploaded a snap of the penis drawing on the Veyron on Saturday.

He wrote, 'I got to spray paint this on @vgtorious #buggati today haha #prank #twinztv #youtube #funny #seattle with @_twinztv_ @twinztv2 @andreysmygov.'

TwinzTV already featured the Bugatti Veyron in an August YouTube video, Car Crushing pointed out.

In that clip, a man leans against the Veyron picking up women, with a much less expensive silver car parked behind him.

When he convinces the women to get food with him, all but one leave when they realize he is not the Veyron's actual owner - and actually owns the silver car.",unrelated
803,ISIS Beheading of U.S. Journalist James Foley Posted to YouTube,"Vice founder Shane Smith, with something that is not caviar.  Via twitter.com

Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Vice founder Shane Smith recently balled out exceptionally hard on a dinner for a group of 12 at the Prime Steakhouse in Las Vegas, racking up a $300,000 check.

A source at Vice told BuzzFeed News that Smith won a sum “well north of that bill” while gambling during his week at the CES conference in Las Vegas, and paid for the dinner on his personal credit card. (A Financial Times report says Smith won $1 million; both the FT and New York Times say there were about 30 people eating on Smith’s dime.)

Smith himself hasn’t commented on the story, which is a pity, because the world needs to know the answer to a crucial question: How can you spend $300,000 on dinner?

Short of a how-to guide from the man himself, or a member of his $2.5 billion digital media empire, we’re left to speculate. So in that spirit, we checked out the menu at Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino. Here’s our best guess of how Smith and a party of 12 could have racked up a tab the value of a single-family home.

Prime’s Siberian Sturgeon Caviar with traditional accompaniments was likely a must for Smith’s group. The restaurant lists the item as market price, but Eater Las Vegas has it going for up to $2,500 per pound. A couple pounds of caviar seems reasonable.

ALLEKO/ALLEKO

Mercifully for Smith, Prime doesn’t put its wine list online. But just down the strip at Mario Batali’s Carnevino in the Wynn, a few bottles of Dom Perignon (2003) will run guests $400 each.

Jay L. Clendenin/Los Angeles Times / MCT

But what are we, farmers? Any respectable internet baron is going to spring for a couple of bottles of the best champagne in the house. At Batali’s joint, a 1.5-liter bottle of Boërl & Kroff 1998 will set you back $15,000 each.

AntonMatveev/AntonMatveev

Obviously white wine accompanies any good foodie’s fish course. Smith’s crew could have grabbed a couple bottles of the $9,000 Montrachet, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti from 2007. An average year, but sometimes compromise is necessary.

Manakin/Manakin

For the reds, perhaps a couple of vintages on the more reasonable side, like the $5,000 per bottle Sine Qua Non “Just for the Love of It” 2002 Syrah.

804,Boko Haram denies ceasefire claim by Nigeria's government,"A rogue bird let loose on Vladimir Putin over the weekend as the Russian president delivered a speech opening a World War I monument, according to multiple tittering reports. If that tale of feathered vigilante justice sounds farfetched though, that's because it is: The video purporting to show the airborne assault appears to be a sneaky editing job.

Here's the clip that got Reddit's attention:

Yet as another Redditor points out, other footage from the event shows Putin sans poop. (The snippet from the previous video comes around the ninth minute below.)

Pictures from before and after the speech similarly show no tell-tale white stain, according to The Independent.

806,Nigeria: hopes for return of kidnapped schoolgirls rise after ceasefire reported,"(CNN) -- Boko Haram laughed off Nigeria's announcement of a ceasefire agreement, saying there is no such deal and schoolgirls abducted in spring have been converted to Islam and married off.

Nigerian officials announced two weeks ago that they had struck a deal with the Islamist terror group.

The deal, the government said, included the release of more than 200 girls whose kidnapping in April at a boarding school in the nation's north stunned the world.

In a video released Saturday, the Islamist group's notorious leader fired off a series of denials.

""Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?"" Abubakar Shekau said. ""They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.""

Shekau slammed reports of their planned release.

""We married them off. They are in their marital homes,"" he said, chuckling.

The group's leader also denied knowing the negotiator with whom the government claimed it worked out a deal, saying he does not represent Boko Haram.

""We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,"" he said of the negotiator.

It wasn't clear when the video was made.

Mike Omeri, coordinator of Nigeria's National Information Centre, told CNN on Saturday that all these claims contradict those made in conversations in which the Nigerian government has been involved.

Omeri said Nigeria's government will do everything possible to verify the claims made in the video.

Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to the aide.

The ceasefire deal announced October 17 followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.

After the deal was announced, the aide said final negotiations on the girls' release would be completed at a meeting a week later in Chad.

That day passed without any signs of the girls.

Boko Haram a growing challenge

In the video, Shekau talked not of peace but of more violence -- promising more ""war, striking and killing with gun.""

This strategy appears to be playing out in parts of Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire. More people have been abducted and scores killed in recent weeks, including one attack a day after the ceasefire that left eight dead.

Days later, members of the Islamist terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria, residents said Thursday.

Heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted, residents said.

For its part, the Nigerian government isn't backing down.

Rather, it is stepping up its military campaign against militants and criminals in some parts of the West African nation, Nigeria's defense ministry said on Saturday.

The military claimed its airstrikes and ground operations have repelled attacks against civilians in Adamawa and Borno, two of the states in northeastern Nigeria that have been strongholds and frequent targets for Boko Haram.

Officials are ""studying"" the latest video, even as the military continues to recognize the talks aimed at assuring the release of the kidnapped schoolgirls, the ministry said.

Boko Haram, whose name translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the Hausa language, is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Like ISIS, it has ambitions for a caliphate, or religious state.

The group's attacks have intensified in recent years in an apparent show of defiance for the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the government.

As part of its insurgency, it has bombed schools, churches and mosques, kidnapped women and children and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

808,"Boko Haram Cease-Fire: Abducted Nigerian Schoolgirls To Be Released, Officials Say","A video has surfaced purporting to depict American journalist James Wright Foley being beheaded by those who claim to be ISIS rebels. James Wright Foley disappeared in northwest Syria on November 22, 2012.

The video features text saying “Obama authorizes military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims.” It then cuts to a clip of Obama announcing airstrikes against ISIS and then to Foley kneeling in orange, next to a man wearing black with his face covered. In it, Foley is forced to read a letter urging Americans to rise up against his “real killer,” the “U.S. government.” I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killer, the U.S. government. What will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality.”

According to Time’s Mirren Gidda:

American airstrikes began earlier this month in an attempt to help thousands of people—members of the Yazidi, an ethnic minority in the region—who were trapped on a mountain range by fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS). President Barack Obama formally told Congress on Sunday that he had sanctioned additional air raids, though he said they would be limited. The new strikes, requested by the Iraqi government, were intended to help Iraqi and Kurdish security forces who had been battling the militants for control of the strategic Mosul Dam. Aided by U.S. air support, these troops successfully recaptured it on Aug. 18.

The video also shows a man on his knees who is allegedly Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who went missing in Syria on Aug. 3, 2013. According to the video, Sotloff’s fate depends on Obama’s “next decision.”

809,New Audio Recording From Ferguson May Capture Michael Brown Shooting,"A hoax story alleging the British graffiti artist Banksy has been arrested and has had his identity revealed has once again duped thousands of people online.

According to the highly refutable website National Report, a 'news' website consisting entirely of fake stories, the artist was arrested by Metropolitan Police at his studio and his identity revealed as 35-year-old Paul Horner, originally from Liverpool.

The article contains all the elements you would expect to see from a news story covering an arrest, including details from police and quotes from those close to Banksy.

However, it only takes the bare minimum of fact-checking and research to spot that this story is a hoax.

The article claims the story has been confirmed by the BBC (it hasn't) and that City of London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy's arrest (he never did and Edwards doesn't even exist).

US news site CNN also did not conduct an interview with Banksy's ""project manager"" John Hawes following his arrest (also because he doesn't exist).

The 'revealed identity' of Banksy is also suspicious.

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users $2.99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15-year-old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager's house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4.

The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics, a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who, unsurprisingly since his previous stories include 'Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month' and 'Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis', has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism.

One final, major clue that the story is a hoax is that the exact same thing has happened before. Last February, a fake press release that again claimed Banksy has been arrested and again claimed his name is Paul Horner did the rounds, with Jezebel being one of the more high-profile websites to publish the hoax before later taking it down.

Despite this, the latest 'Banksy arrested' story has been shared more than 200,000 times on Facebook and Twitter, proving there are still people who will believe anything they read on the internet.

811,Fence jumper reportedly made it much further into White House than Secret Service said,"Islamic State leaders in Syria and Iraq are training their fighters to fly captured fighter jets in the hope of establishing an air force, it has been claimed.

The terror group are understood to have been carrying out test flights the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, according to a British-based organisation monitoring the Syrian Civil War.

Having captured three fighter jets from the Syrian military, ISIS are using Iraqi pilots who were once officers in Saddam Hussein's air force to train Syria-based militants to operate the warplanes.

The news comes as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula sought to mend its strained relations with ISIS, urging all jihadist groups operating in the Middle East to unite under the common cause of fighting against Western 'crusader' armies.

Fighter: It is not clear if ISIS' jets are equipped with weaponry nor if the pilots are able to fly long distances, but witnesses said the planes appear to have been seized from the Syrian Air Force (pictured)

Power: ISIS has been steadily building a full-equipped military - including large tanks, such as the one pictured here in Raqqa). Much of the equipment in their possession has been seized from Syrian regime forces

Show of strength: ISIS militants take part in a military parade along the streets of Raqqa earlier this year

ISIS' alleged test flights over the Aleppo countryside are understood to be the first time the terror group - which seized control of vast swathes of Syria and Iraq earlier this year - has taken to the air.

'They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for Saddam Hussein,' said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

'People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,' he said, citing witnesses near al-Jarrah military airport.

The airport, which was seized from the Syrian regime earlier this year, is approximately 45 miles from the Turkish border.

It is not clear if the jets are equipped with weaponry nor if the pilots are able to fly long distances, but witnesses said the planes appear to be Soviet-built MiG 21 or MiG 23 models.

Leader: News of ISIS' test flights comes as Al Qaeda - which has previously condemned ISIS for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with the group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured)

Declaration: Titled 'Statement on the Crusader Coalition', the document is Al Qaeda's strongest show of support for ISIS since leader Ayman al-Zawahiri denounced the group for the brutal tactics late last year

Islamic State militants have been almost entirely driven out of the Syrian city of Kobane following a remarkable fightback by Kurdish forces who vowed to either defeat the terrorists or die trying.

The extremists have abandoned all of their positions in the city, except for two small pockets of resistance in the east of the city, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal said.

As recently as Monday it looked as if the fall of Kobane was imminent.

The massively outgunned Kurdish fighters had been pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ISIS militants advancing into the suburbs, leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents facing rape and massacre.

But with the help of the most intense U.S. and Arab bombing raids of the anti-ISIS campaign so far, the Kurdish forces have been able to kill hundreds of militants over the past two days.

They have also managed to force the militants have not been killed to retreat further into the outskirts of the town.

News that ISIS have been almost entirely forced out of Kobane comes after two days of heavy air strikes by U.S. warplanes.

ISIS' alleged test flights come despite American and Arab warplanes carrying out dozens of bombing raids against the group in Syria.

The terrorists have regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and have overrun several military bases but this was the first time it had been able to pilot warplanes.

Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts had previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria, but the aircraft had appeared unusable, according to analysts and diplomats.

News of the test flights comes as Al Qaeda - which has previously condemned ISIS for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's group.

In a statement released today, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - the notorious terror collective's Yemen-based franchise - urged jihadists throughout the Middle East to put their differences aside, according to Charlie Winter, a researcher on jihad at counter-terrorism think-tank Quilliam

The document is understood to have called for Al Qaeda - who are represented in Syria by the Nusra Front and Khorasan terror groups - to stop fighting with ISIS, adding that the militants should instead focus on attacking Western 'crusader' forces and carrying out strikes on American targets.

Titled 'Statement on the Crusader Coalition', the document is Al Qaeda's strongest show of support for ISIS since leader Ayman al-Zawahiri denounced the group for the brutal tactics late last year.

Advance: The Islamic State and its allied Sunni militants seized the Anbar city of Fallujah, parts of Ramadi and large rural areas of Anbar early this year

Checkpoint: Earlier today, Iraqi officials in the western Anbar province said a curfew has been imposed in the provincial capital Ramadi (pictured) over fears that the Islamic State group might try to advance on the city

Security: ISIS has been making gains around Ramadi in recent weeks against the embattled Iraqi military, despite ongoing U.S.-led coalition airstrikes on the militants

'We urge all Muslims to back their brethren, with their souls, money and tongues, against the crusaders,' the Al Qaeda statement reads.

It also urges Muslims to support 'whoever can weaken the Americans to weaken them militarily, economically, and media-wise.'

Earlier today, Iraqi officials in the western Anbar province said a curfew has been imposed in the provincial capital Ramadi over fears that the Islamic State group might try to advance on the city.

Sabah Karhout, the chairman of the Anbar provincial council, says the curfew began at midnight this morning as part of an effort to limit movement in and out of the city.

ISIS has been making gains around Ramadi in recent weeks against the embattled Iraqi military, despite ongoing U.S.-led coalition airstrikes on the militants.

Two Iraqi military officials, speaking anonymously because they are not authorized to brief the media, say major operations are underway in Salahuddin province to retake key areas from the Sunni militants around Tikrit and the Beiji oil refinery.

ISIS and allied Sunni militants seized the Anbar city of Fallujah, parts of Ramadi and large rural areas of Anbar early this year.

The loss of Fallujah - where American troops engaged in some of the heaviest fighting of the more than eight-year U.S.-led war in the country - foreshadowed the later loss of Iraq's second city of Mosul and much of the north.

Six senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a symbol of the terrorists' expanding influence among Islamist groups.

Withdrawing their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban's leader Mohammad Omar, the men - made up of the group's chief spokesman Shahidullah Shahid and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the Pakistani Taliban, but added they now consider themselves affiliates of ISIS.

The move is likely to have serious consequences for security in Pakistan, particularly near the Afghan border where all six of the men are based, leaving it open to the kind of violence and brutal oppression ISIS has employed in the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq under the group's control.

Militants: Withdrawing their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban's leader Mohammad Omar, the men - made up of the group's chief spokesman Shahidullah Shahid (centre) and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the Pakistani Taliban, but added they now consider themselves affiliates of ISIS

The official announcement of the six men's declaration of allegiance to ISIS came in the form of an audio recording that emerged on Wednesday. However rumours had been circulating for weeks that several senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban were set to declare their loyalty to al-Baghdadi.

'I show allegiance to the commander of faithful, Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Qureshi al Hussaini, and will listen and obey every order of you and will follow your orders regardless of what circumstances may be,' Shahid said in the recording.

There is now concern that other senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban may defect to ISIS, including the group's overall leader Maulana Fazlullah, who has previously voiced support for the terror group.

Despite several members having declared their ISIS sympathies, the announcement is the first time any senior figure within the Pakistani Taliban has actually sworn allegiance to al-Baghdadi.",unrelated
812,Italian fisherman catches monstrous 280-pound catfish,"Seven girls, ages 13 to 15, are pregnant after a five-day school trip to their country’s capital city and their parents are being blamed.

The schoolgirls, from the city of Banja Luka, went to the Bosnia and Herzegovina capital, Sarajevo.

Nenad Babici, the national coordinator for reproductive health of the republic, told Inserbia.info that it was discovered that the seven schoolgirls got pregnant on the school trip.

The school in Banja Luka had taken 28 girls to the nation’s capital city for a five-day trip to visit museums and historic sights in the city, ranked among the finest in the world.

Furious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision, reported the Daily Mail.

However, Babici blamed parents for not educating their children properly.

He said that early sexual relations later lead to adverse consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.

Senad Mehmedbasic, a Sarajevo gynecologist, said a growing trend of underage pregnancies in Bosnia and Herzegovina is worrying.

“That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,” he told Inserbia.info.

Educational institutes and parents, he said, should play a stronger role in providing effective sex education.

“It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education, so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences.

“We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.”

Wright's fellow journalist Ihan Tanir gave some background on the situation on Twitter.

More from Noah Rothman:

The American photojournalist James Wright Foley was working for Agence France Presse when he was captured crossing the Syria-Turkish border in 2012. The American war reporter had previously been held for six weeks by pro-Gaddafi forces in Libya while covering that conflict. Some believed that his capture would be similarly short-lived. Tragically, that would not be the case.

“On November 22, 2012, James Wright Foley, a freelance photo journalist, was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria,” the FBI noted in November, 2012. “Foley had employed a translator to help him travel across the Syrian-Turkish border. The translator was also taken, but later released.”
Swift justice is in order. Immediately. May his family find peace in this extremely difficult time.

An ISIS-associated YouTube account posted a new video online Tuesday entitled, “Weapons and munitions dropped by American planes and landed in the areas controlled by the Islamic State in Kobani.” The video was also posted on the Twitter account of “a3maq news,” which acts as an unofficial media arm of ISIS. The outfit has previously posted videos of ISIS fighters firing American made Howitzer cannons and seizing marijuana fields in Syria.

ISIS had broadly advertised its acquisition of a broad range of U.S.-made weapons during its rampage across Iraq. ISIS videos have showed its fighters driving U.S. tanks, MRAPs, Humvees. There are unconfirmed reports ISIS has stolen three fighter planes from Iraqi bases it conquered.

The authenticity of this latest video could not be independently confirmed, but the ISIS fighters in the video are in possession of a rich bounty of American hand grenades, rounds for small rockets, and other supplies that they will surely turn around and use on the Kurdish forces they are fighting in and around the Turkish border city.

On Monday, White House Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes said the U.S. government was confident that the emergency airdropped supplies for the Kurdish forces near Kobani were falling into the right hands.

“We feel very confident that, when we air drop support as we did into Kobani… we’ve been able to hit the target in terms of reaching the people we want to reach,” Rhodes told CNN. “What I can assure people is that, when we are delivering aid now, we focus it on the people we want to receive that assistance. Those are civilians in need. Those are forces that we’re aligned with in the fight against ISIL [the government’s preferred acronym for ISIS], and we take precautions to make sure that it’s not falling into the wrong hands.”

Rhodes was responding to questions about a Monday report in The Daily Beast that U.S. humanitarian aid was flowing into ISIS controlled areas near Kobani by truck. That aid was mostly food and medical supplies, not the kind of lethal weapons in the new ISIS video.

Senior administration officials said Sunday that three American planes dropped a total of 27 bundles near Kobani and more U.S. air drops could come as part of the joint U.S.-Iraqi effort to aid Kurdish fighters in the Kobani area. The supplies were provided by Kurdish authorities, the official said.

In the new footage, the weapons appear to be U.S. made. There have also been at least 135 air strikes against ISIS in the area, according to the State Department.

The airstrikes and air drops appear to be having an impact. The Daily Beast’s Jamie Dettmer, reporting from the Syrian border, said the morale in Kobani has shifted in the last 24 hours. But ISIS continues to hold major swaths of territory in and around Kobani, despite widespread media reports to the contrary. And the civilians there are suffering, badly.

“I think what this represents is the President recognizes this is going to be a long-term campaign against ISIL; and that we need to look for whatever opportunity we can find to degrade that enemy and to support those who are fighting against ISIL on the ground,” a senior administration official told reporters.",unrelated

816,Kim Jong-un 'Had Surgery on Fractured Ankles',"The sound of 10 or 11 shots from the gun of Ferguson, Mo. police officer Darren Wilson being fired at Michael Brown were recorded by a man in an apartment near the Aug. 9 shooting, according to the man’s attorney who shared the audio with CNN.

The network aired the recording Monday but has not verified its authenticity.

The 12-second audio begins with a man seemingly leaving a message for someone on an adult video service.

Six shots fired in rapid succession are heard in the background. After a two second pause, another four or five shots ring out.

Lopa Blumenthal, the unnamed man’s attorney, told CNN that her client has been interviewed by the FBI.

“At the time he didn’t even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards,” Blumenthal said. “It just happened to have captured twelve seconds of what transpired outside of his building.”

While it is difficult to clearly make out whether 10 or 11 shots are fired, Blumenthal told CNN she believes she heard 11.

Details surrounding the recording are unclear, including why it is emerging over two weeks after the shooting.

It is also unclear at what point the man began recording the message that captured the gun shots. Witnesses as well as law enforcement officials have said that Wilson fired one and perhaps two isolated shots in his police cruiser before numerous shots were fired outside of the car. The new audio seemingly does not capture the one or two shots fired inside Wilson’s cruiser.

Wilson has reportedly claimed that the gun went off in the cruiser during an altercation with Brown in which the 18-year-old shoved him into the car, assaulted him, and struggled to grab the weapon.

After the altercation in the car, witnesses say that Brown fled. From there, Brown’s movements and Wilson’s response are also unclear.

Wilson reportedly claims that after pursuing Brown, the man turned around to face him, taunted him and then began charging before Wilson fired the fatal shots.

Some witnesses say that Wilson began shooting after Brown fled. At that point Brown turned around in order to surrender but Wilson continued firing the fatal shots anyway, the witnesses said.

In a press conference shortly after the shooting, St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar said that Wilson fired “more than just a couple [of shots]” but provided no further detail.

According to a CNN report filed days after the shooting, witnesses claimed that they heard up to 10 shots. Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown’s who was with him during the shooting, told of only a few.

A medical examiner who performed a private autopsy on Brown determined that he was shot at least six times. He had eight wounds on his body, but two may have been re-entry wounds.

It was initially reported that the altercation and shooting followed an argument after Wilson ordered Brown and Johnson to get out of the middle of the road. But it later emerged that Brown had stolen cigars and shoved a store clerk just minutes before he encountered Wilson. Wilson reportedly says that seconds after their first encounter, he received the police dispatch call reporting the strong-arm robbery and then doubled-back to confront the two.

817,"Explosion reported near the Nicaraguan capital attributed to meteorite impact, but experts, including NASA, cast doubt on claims","Young North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s health is just fine, his government said Thursday evening, so his sister is probably not running the country. It was said Kim Yo Jong had taken over while her brother underwent medical treatment, but So Se Pyong, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told Reuters Kim was not in bad health.

The ambassador sat down for an interview where he discussed a variety of matters, including North Korea's nuclear program, possibly negotiations to free three detained Americans and, of course, Kim’s health.

It has been rumored Kim, 31, might have had ankle surgery, but So said that is incorrect. The story emerged after Kim did not appear at the Supreme People's Assembly last month and reports said he suffered from ""discomfort.” He was also seen walking with a limp in July. ""That is rumors, fabricated rumors,"" So said about Kim's alleged ailment.

Questions about Kim’s health rose after an article from the Diplomat, a magazine based in Tokyo, claimed his sister was making important government decisions while Kim was being treated at Bonghwa Clinic in North Korea's capital Pyongyang.

""Some say Hwang Byong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo Jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,"" Kim Heung Gwang, the head of North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, reportedly said.

Even if So denies any health problems, Kim has not been seen by his people since Sept. 3. The leader also gained a significant amount of weight, which could contribute to ailments like gout, diabetes or high blood pressure, sources told the Associated Press. If he were suffering from gout, his cheese eating and smoking would worsen the condition.

818,This Kid Made $72 Million During Lunch,"The Apple Watch reveal back in September was big on excitement, but short on details. Among those things that Apple failed to mention was whether or not Cupertino’s new smartwatch will be able to withstand liquids — making it suitable for, say, swimming or washing the dishes.

While we still don’t have a final, definitive answer on what is and is not advisable with the Apple Watch, Tim Cook shed a bit of light on the mystery during a Q&A session with staff at the Kurfürstendamm Apple Store in Berlin, Germany, where he is currently visiting. Cook said that that he wears his Apple Watch “even in the shower.”

This is in contrast with what we had previously heard, courtesy of tech journalist David Pogue, who after a private briefing with Apple advised readers that, “Sweating [while wearing the Apple Watch], wearing it in the rain, washing your hands, or cooking with it is fine. Take it off before the swim or get in the shower, though.”

As much as we respect Pogue, you’d have to say that — when it comes to Apple advice — Cook trumps Pogue!

The Apple CEO also answered a few other questions in what sounds like an interesting session. Among them was a bit more clarification on the Apple Watch’s battery life, with Cook saying he removes the device to recharge overnight — something we’ve suspected based on previous reports.

Cook talked about some of the possible applications of the Apple Watch, including monitoring auctions on eBay — or else accessing hotel rooms in a way similar to existing apps for the iPhone.

Answering a question from a visually impaired employee, he said that the Apple Watch will have more accessibility features added over time, although it sounds like these features will be limited at first.

No price tariff was given for the device, but Cook confirmed that Apple will begin marketing the device in April. In what sounds like an amusing moment, Cook sidestepped the question of whether retail staff could have all have an Apple Watch to more easily show customers, by saying that it is a “good idea” and that he would “consider it.”

Cook also spoke about his efforts to improve working conditions in China, and lamented the fact that the media often choose to paint Apple in a bad light in this regard. Cook said that Apple is trying to ensure that there is no abuse of employees on the supply chain, and that they work fairer numbers of hours.

Finally, he addressed the reports that Apple Pay could be available in Europe soon by saying that Apple aimed for this to be the case “before the end of the year.”",unrelated

820,"Suspected meteorite leaves crater in Managua, is linked to asteroid","The United States appears to now be flying unarmed surveillance drones over the IS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria. The pictures thus far suggest that the drone being used is the MQ-1 Reaper.

The two photos show the distinct downward facing V-shaped tail used on Predator drones, and the aircraft does not appear to be carrying any missiles. As such, the available evidence indicates that the drone is being used for surveillance purposes, rather than in a hunter-killer type mission.

According to local activists, the drone has been circling over the city for three hours. If the reports are true, this would suggest that the air environment over Raqqa is permissive. Drones are visible on radar and easy to shoot down with air defense systems.

The evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery – and possibly signals intelligence (SIGINT) — of Islamic State positions in the group’s most important stronghold. There is little doubt that this mission is intended to give U.S. policymakers more information about IS positions in Raqqa. However, it does not necessarily signal the imminent use of force against IS positions in Syria.

As of now, there is no information about where the drones are based. However, open-source information allows for some informed guesses.

The United States currently bases Predator drones in Turkey at Incirlik Air Force Base in Turkey. The three drones are routinely flown over Northern Iraq and data is shared in real time with the Turkish military.

A second possibility could be that the drones are being flown from Kuwait. Satellite imagery captured the deployment of U.S. drones at Ali Salem Air Base.

A third option is that the United States is now flying drones from an airbase in Iraqi Kurdistan.

A regional security expert also reports that Predator drones were seen operating in the civilian airport near Erbil.

821,Report: Christian Bale Will Play Steve Jobs,"TOKYO — Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumors covering every possibility from a stroke to a coup d’etat, is merely recovering from ankle surgery, a South Korean newspaper has reported.

Kim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.

“I heard that Kim Jong Un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,” the source was quoted as saying, adding that he had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.

Such is the fascination with North Korea, the world’s most impenetrable country, that rumors spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.

Nevertheless, it is true that Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, causing speculation about his health. But the gossip mill started up again last week when Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since Sept. 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. It went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the “Great Successor,” as he is known, was in an “indisposed condition.”

“Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,” said the narrator of a documentary called “Improving the Lives of the People,” showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month. It aired just before the session of the assembly, North Korea’s quasi-parliament, was broadcast, the Daily NK Web site reported.

With Kim shown carting around heavy things, the narrator continued: “His whole body is drenched in sweat, but he does not stop working hard, instead showing concern for the health of the other workers.”

Separately, the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Workers’ Party, recently reported that Kim had “labored on,” visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather.

Outside commentators have guessed that Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.

Weibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China’s official papers, ran a commentary Monday titled “For those who make up rumors of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?”

“Netizens who have a radical opinion can’t represent the opinion of China and China’s attitude toward North Korea was not changed,” the paper said.

In Washington, U.S. officials said they had no information about North Korea’s leader. “I can just say that I have no confirmation of the reports,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. “We’ve seen them, but we don’t have any confirmation.”

In Beijing, a U.S. diplomat said Monday that North Korea has rejected U.S. efforts to discuss the detention of three Americans, Reuters reported. Glyn Davies, U.S. special representative for North Korean policy, who is visiting the region, said Pyongyang’s refusal to discuss the issue was a sign that it “doesn’t have an interest in coming back into the international system as a responsible country.”",unrelated
822,Audio recording allegedly captures moment Michael Brown was shot,"A DESPERATE mother was tricked into feasting on cooked meat from the body of her son by Islamic State militants, it has been claimed.

The famished Kurdish mother had gone to plead with the jihadists to release her son.

Cruel militants delayed talks with the elderly mum – feeding her a meal made with the corpse of her offspring while she waited.

The depraved story was relayed by a brave Briton fighting on the front line with Kurdish forces against the Islamic State, also referred to as IS, ISIS and ISIL.

Yasir Abdulla left behind his wife and children at their Yorkshire home for six months to battle for his Kurdish homeland.

The 36-year-old said the disturbing story was the cause of his hatred against IS – and one of the reasons he has vowed to return to his war-ravaged native county and ""finish the job"".

The father-of-four told The Sun: ""I hate IS because of what happened to an old Kurdish woman from a nearby tribe.

""Her son was captured by IS fighters and taken as a prisoner to Mosul. She was determined to find her son and went to IS headquarters and asked to see him.

""The IS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

""They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were so kind.

But security guard Mr Abdulla then adds: ""They had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said, 'You've just EATEN him'.""

""They burn people alive, they chop off people's heads, there is no limit to their depravity.

""They are not Muslims, they have hijacked Islam. All they do is hate.""

The shocking account is just the latest in a string of disturbing executions and punishments administered by the immoral group.

In February, IS released a highly-choreographed propaganda film showing Jordanian fighter pilot Lieutenant Mouath al-Kasaesbeh soaked in fuel and being burned alive inside a cage.

Another video from the organisation showed a man believed to be gay thrown from a seven-storey building. The 50-year-old man, who was blindfolded throughout his sickening fall, is seen to be still alive after hitting the ground below.

He was later stoned to his death by a waiting mob.

Some have interpreted the perceived increase in brutality from the Islamic State as a sign of their weakness.

The terror organisation have suffered a number of defeats recently, including the loss of two strongholds in Iraq.

Last week, Kurdish gunmen stormed the town of Tel Hamis and fought back control from Islamic State rebels.

The group, aided by US-led coalition airstrikes, previously won back the seized border town of Kobani.

Infamous Islamic State militant Jihadi John, who is believed to have orchestrated the beheadings of dozens of hostages, was last week unmasked as a hypocritical cannabis smoker from west London.

Fearless Mr Abdulla, speaking after temporarily returning to his family home in Keighley, West Yorkshire, said: ""IS are very good at making people scared.

""If they make one person scared then that person will make another person scared and soon everyone is scared of IS.

""But the Kurds are not scared of them. Someone has to stand and fight. We have got thousands of people in many villages and towns behind us.

""If we fall then all of those places fall, and that can't happen. The Peshmerga [Military forces of Iraqi Kurdistan] can't wait to take the fight to IS.

823,Fears Islamic State could launch EBOLA attack on Britain after fighters 'contract virus',"(CNN) -- A woman held by Lebanese authorities is not the wife of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Iraq's Interior Ministry said Wednesday, injecting further confusion into an already murky situation.

The reported detention of a wife and child of al-Baghdadi -- the leader of a self-declared Islamic state spanning large areas of Iraq and Syria -- has spurred intrigue into who exactly the woman is and what she might know about the terrorist group's inner workings.

But the Iraqi ministry, citing a source in an intelligence cell under its authority, said the woman's identity didn't match up with either of the names it has for al-Baghdadi's two wives.

Authorities in Lebanon, where the woman was arrested, haven't officially commented on the matter. Neither has the CIA, amid suggestions that Western intelligence was involved in her capture.

Before the Iraqi announcement further muddied the waters, the details surrounding al-Dulaimi and her capture were already pretty fuzzy.

Here are some of the main areas of interest -- and contention.

She's his wife. Or his ex-wife. Or neither.

Regional sources close to the capture told CNN that they are certain that Lebanese forces arrested al-Baghdadi's wife.

But American sources in Washington gave a different view, suggesting the person detained was al-Baghdadi's ex-wife, not a current one.

Intelligence sources had told CNN that the woman's name is Saja al-Dulaimi. But the Iraqi ministry stated bluntly Tuesday, ""There is no wife named Saja al-Dulaimi.""

It said al-Dulaimi is the sister of a man who is imprisoned in Iraq and has been sentenced to death for a series of bombings.

Iraqi intelligence identified al-Baghdadi's wives as Asma Fawzi Mohammed al-Dulaimi and Israa Rajab Mahal Al-Qaisi.

It doesn't help that Baghdadi's family life is cloaked in mystery.

A biography posted on jihadist websites last year gave little away, stating simply that he was ""married."" CNN was told al-Baghdadi has two wives. The news agency Reuters, citing tribal sources in Iraq, said he has three.

And ISIS certainly isn't confirming anything. Some of its members took to social media Tuesday to deny that any wife of Baghdadi had been arrested.

She wielded power. But how much?

If the woman is indeed Al-Dulaimi, she is a ""powerful figure"" within ISIS and is ""very active"" in the organization, a regional source with knowledge of the operation told CNN.

She was reported to have previously been held by the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad. In March, al-Dulaimi was released from Syrian custody as part of a group of 150 women who were freed in return for a group of Syrian nuns, an intelligence source told CNN.

But her apparent attempt to cross into Lebanon with a child at a time when authorities there are tightening security around the border raises questions about the state of her relationship with al-Baghdadi.

""Is he estranged from them? Has he fallen out with them? Were they escaping from him?"" asked Sajjan M. Gohel, the international security director at the Asia Pacific Foundation.

Uncertainty also remains about how much influence al-Dulaimi would have had within ISIS, which is known for its oppressive treatment of women.

Analysts say women who join ISIS may find their role limited to that of housewife for jihadi men.

But in February, ISIS formed Al-Khansaa, a female battalion with about 60 members whose job is to inspect women who pass through checkpoints and to enforce the organization's strict morality code for women.

She could reveal vital intelligence. Or hardly anything.

The arrest of al-Dulaimi, if indeed it was her, was a coordinated operation involving intelligence agencies from Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, an intelligence source familiar with the arrest told CNN.

The source said the Iraqis had help from the U.S. intelligence community, an account corroborated by a second source in the region with knowledge of the operation. But in Washington, the CIA had no comment on the matter.

Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, expressed confidence that the United States would be able to ""gain some intelligence"" from al-Dulaimi.

""We may get insights into al-Baghdadi's movement, who he surrounds himself with, whether he was injured, and the degree of his injuries,"" he said, referring to recent reports that al-Baghdadi was hurt in airstrikes.

Not everyone was convinced she would provide a treasure trove of insight into ISIS, though.

Expressing skepticism, a former senior U.S. military official told The New York Times that in the Iraq war, the Americans captured a wife of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader or al Qaeda in Iraq, ISIS' forerunner.

""We got little out of her, and when we sent her back, Zarqawi killed her,"" the unidentified official told the newspaper.

And since al-Dulaimi was reportedly seized more than a week ago, what intelligence she carried may already have passed its sell-by date.

""In military conflicts, information flows are very immediate, and they become yesterday's news very quickly,"" said Michael Stephens, a Middle East research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.

She was with a son. Or a daughter.

The identity of the child with al-Dulaimi is still the subject of conflicting reports.

An intelligence source told CNN that the child was al-Dulaimi's 4-year-old son. Other news organizations, including Agence France-Presse and the Associated Press, also reported that it was a young boy.

But Reuters, which originally had reported the same thing, later revised its reporting to say that she was with a daughter. The New York Times also said it was a daughter rather than a son.

Deepening the intrigue, one regional source even told CNN that al-Baghdadi himself has been calling up asking for his son to be released.

The full picture of who exactly Lebanese authorities have in their custody is still to be revealed

Olsen certainly made several major allegations.

He also claimed that Woods used a ""cheater ball.""

""It's not testosterone, but it's something else,"" Olsen told the station, per Harig. ""I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.""

""These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,'' said Steinberg in a statement earlier, courtesy of Harig. ""They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.""

Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour, added that, ""There is no truth whatsoever to these claims. We categorically deny these allegations.""

However, the PGA Tour told Harig that if a player tested positive for PEDs, they were required to announce the suspension, while any punishments for recreational drugs remain undisclosed. 

Olsen's original claims, or opinions, are certainly inflammatory and it remains to be seen if he will be reprimanded

The picture was posted online by the Islamic extremist group Ansar al-Deen Front, according to a CBS News report.

The photo shows a black pickup truck with a Mark-1 Plumbing decal on the door and an anti-aircraft gun in the bed.

Mark Oberholtzer, who has owned the company for 32 years, said he traded that truck at an AutoNation dealership three years ago and has no idea how it ended up in Syria.

""They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn't do it,"" Oberholtzer said. ""How it ended up in Syria, I'll never know.""

Oberholtzer said his business has received a thousand calls and faxes this week about the photo.

""A few of the people are really ugly,"" he said.

Oberholtzer said he just wanted people to know the vehicle was no longer his.

""I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth,"" he said.

""We have no official notification ... that it is Ebola,"" Christy Feig, director of communications for WHO, told Mashable, though WHO has contacted Iraqi officials to offer help.

Iraq's Ministry of Health also denied that anyone in Mosul had contracted the Ebola virus, which broke out in March in West Africa. Spokesman Ahmed Rudaini told news site Al-Maalomah that Mosul doesn't even have the technological capability to diagnose Ebola cases -- only Baghdad does. Therefore, he said, the reports that Ebola has infected anyone in Mosul are ""incorrect"" and ""unfounded.""

The discussion started with an article in Iraq's official newspaper, Al-Sabah, that said ""terrorists"" brought Ebola to Mosul. ""Many diseases and epidemics have spread among residents of the city of Mosul,"" it read. ""Two Ebola and 26 HIV/AIDS cases were registered.""

Ebola is primarily a threat in West Africa, where its latest outbreak has killed nearly 8,000 people. Mashable reported ISIS has not recruited fighters from any countries severely affected by the disease. Its African members are primarily from Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia.

In the event ISIS does have Ebola, the militants could use it as a biological terror technique, Forbes reported in October. Members could contract the virus on purpose and then go to foreign countries to infect others. “The individual exposed to the Ebola virus would be the carrier,” national security professor Al Shimkus told Forbes. “In the context of terrorist activity, it doesn’t take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier.”

ISIS, a body of militants labeled a terrorist group by the United States and European Union (among others), has controlled Mosul since June. Iraq's second-largest city is also ISIS' largest stronghold. The group began spreading across the Middle East last summer, taking over large swaths of Iraq and Syria through brutal tactics.",discuss
831,Boko Haram denies ceasefire claim by Nigeria's government,"DC Toy Collector is the “highest paid performer” on YouTube making nearly $5 million last year unboxing Disney toys. However, little has been known about the woman-behind-the-hands of the popular YouTube channel. In fact, her face is never shown in the video, only her voice, toys and hands. However, a recent report reveals the true identity of the YouTube hit and the identity is somewhat shocking. A former Brazilian porn star is behind the wholesome Disney videos and it is noted that during the early years of “Disney Collector,” the woman was filming both Disney unboxing videos and porn in the same Florida home.

The Daily Mail reports that Brazilian Daiane DeJeus, also known as Sandy Summers in the porn industry, is the woman behind the hit Disney Collector Youtube videos. Reporters tracked down information on DeJeus that aligns with public records information regarding the widely popular DC Toy Collector YouTube channel. After tracking down DeJeus, the reporters spoke with family and friends who confirmed that Daiane was behind the million dollar videos.

DeJeus has went to unfathomable measures to ensure her identity remained secret and for good reason. The target market of the YouTube channel, which caters to Disney lovers such as children and families, may not remain viewers if they knew the owner’s secret. DeJeus was not only a Disney fanatic, but also a porn star. Going by the name Sandy Summers, Dejeus filmed numerous x-rated videos for the adult film industry in the same home that she filmed some of her early DC Toy Collector features.

Family and friends have identified DeJeus as the mystery unboxer and note that certain physical features on the woman’s hands and arms can be seen in many of the YouTube videos.

“They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.”

Aside from the physical similarities, former neighbors say DeJeus has an unmistakable voice and say that many people on the street knew what she was up to.

‘That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere. Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.”

Would you have ever imagined that the popular DC Toy Collector videos were being filmed in the same house as adult films by a porn star?

832,Seth Rogen to Play Apple’s Steve Wozniak,"Big Bank Hank, the New York rapper who, as part of the Sugarhill Gang, released what is generally regarded as the first rap record, has died at the age of 57.

The performer, real name Henry Jackson, died from kidney complications due to cancer, according to reports.

Jackson formed the Sugarhill Gang with Master Gee and Wonder Mic, having a big hit in 1979 with Rapper's Delight.

834,Vladimir Putin’s Motorcade Looks Like A Massive Knob,"Boston - So lately, tongues have been wagging due to a recent story of an elderly priest who died and had a conversation with God, and a female God at that.
The story has been dancing around on Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.
It's also sallied across the seas and made it into the African media and the Indian media.
The story even made it's way to that holy land of obnoxious religious redneckery known as Texas.
The story goes something like this:
An old fart, er, I mean Catholic priest, in Massachusetts was officially dead for over 48 minutes before medical staff ""miraculously"" re-started his heart, World News Daily Report says. All the while, Father John Micheal O'Neal says he went to heaven and met God, who was all motherly and feminine and just happened to be a woman.
Father O'Neal, 71, was rushed to the hospital in late January after being hit with a major heart attack, but was declared dead shortly after his arrival. He was brought back to life via some sort of newfangled mechanical gadgetry and doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital, used more newfangled mechanical gadgetry to unclog vital arteries to his brain. Soon they returned his heart to a normal rhythm. Father O'Neal woke up less than 48 hours later and recovered perfectly, World News Daily Report says.
Well, of course. I mean, after all, if you're going to have a story about some elderly dude talking to God, you can't really have him die, can you? That wouldn't come out in the wash.
There was much wringing of hands, and Catholic Blogger Bridget Mary Meehan wrote:
""The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors. Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O'Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the 'Holy Mother.'""
Then she wonders:
""Why is Cardinal O'Malley and the Boston Archdiocese so upset? You would think he'd be inspired. Perhaps, he is afraid that if God is a woman, then, that could put a big crack in the church's stained glass ceiling and open the door to women priests!""
Sure, why not employ more delusional people? They're certainly entertaining.
But why is the good Archbishop bothered?
Perhaps because Father John Micheal O'Neal doesn't exist. You see, he's really a nice old man on Shutterstock, who probably wishes he were somewhere else other than the hospital.
Terrence Donilon, a spokesman for Archbishop Sean P. O'Malley says the story is a hoax.
""We do not have a priest of this name,"" he told Metro.co.uk. ""I believe this could be a hoax story.""
And despite whatever Meehan thinks, it's never been verified that O'Malley ever issued a public disavowal of the priest's alleged statements. It's just not in the public records, About.com reports.
Perhaps, as this story runs its course, the media will realize it was asleep when it should have been awake.
You see, World News Daily, makes no bones about the fact that it's a satire site. Here's the site's disclaimer:
""WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.""
When Meehan was apprised of the fact that the story was a hoax, she offered up this fantasyland reply:
""According to a recent media update, this story is false, but I believe if it hasn't yet happened, it truly will! Someone once said: 'All stories are true some actually happened.'""
I'm not making this up.

835,Seth Rogen to play Steve Wozniak alongside Christian Bale's Steve Jobs,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria — The leader of Boko Haram has denied agreeing to any cease-fire with the Nigerian government, and said he married off the more than 200 schoolgirls that the Islamic extremist group kidnapped.

In a new video released late Friday night, Abubakar Shekau dashed hopes for a prisoner exchange to get the girls released.

""The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,"" he said, laughing. ""In this war, there is no going back.""

Nigeria's chief of defense staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, on Oct. 17 announced that Boko Haram had agreed to an immediate cease-fire to end a 5-year-old insurgency that has killed thousands of people, and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes in northeast Nigeria.

But attacks and abductions have continued, with the extremists this week seizing Mubi, a town of more than 200,000 people. Fighting also continued Friday in Vimtin, the nearby village where Badeh was born.

Shekau in August announced that Boko Haram wanted to establish an Islamic caliphate, along the lines of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. Fleeing residents have reported that hundreds of people are being detained for infractions of the extremists' version of strict Shariah law in several towns and villages under their control.

Boko Haram's kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls taking exams at a boarding school in the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April prompted an international campaign for their release and criticism of Nigeria's government for not acting quickly to free them. Dozens of the girls escaped on their own in the first few days, but 219 remain missing. The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls has been used on social media sites, including Facebook and Twitter, in an effort to spark conversation about the kidnappings. Nobel Peace Prize laureate and international education activist Malala Yousafzai visited Nigeria in July, and urged Boko Haram to free the kidnapped girls, calling them her ""sisters.""

Unconfirmed reports have indicated that the girls have been broken up into several groups, and that some may have been carried across borders into Cameroon and Chad.

The government had said it had negotiated with two Boko Haram leaders in Chad, with talks hosted by President Idriss Deby, and that it was confident the girls would be freed soon. But Boko Haram has many factions.

Shekau's announcement further discredits the government of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who on Thursday formally announced his candidacy for elections on Feb. 14, 2015, in Africa's most populous nation. Nigeria, with some 160 million people, is divided almost equally between Muslims who dominate the north and Christians in the south. The West African nation is the biggest oil producer on the continent and has its biggest economy.

Jonathan's failure to curtail the insurgency and many corruption scandals are not expected to dim his chances of success. The election, though, is expected to be the most hotly contested since his People's Democratic Party took power after decades of military dictatorship ended in 1994.

Dozens of ruling party legislators have defected to the coalition All Progressives Congress, losing the PDP its majority in the lower house of Parliament. But the coalition is weakened by its inability to choose a presidential candidate, and primaries in December will be contested by three powerful northerners who all are Muslim.

Jonathan, a Christian from a minority southern tribe, has been criticized for ignoring an unwritten party rule to alternate power between Christian and Muslim leaders, adding a religious and ethnic dimension to the election.

836,Biological Warfare on the Horizon? ISIS Soldiers May Be Infected With Ebola,"An Israeli-Canadian woman who traveled to Iraq to fight alongside the Kurds there earlier this month has been abducted by Islamic State fighters, Hebrew media reported Sunday, citing Syrian jihadist-linked media.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, was captured by jihadists near the flashpoint city of Kobani in the past few days, reports said. The former IDF soldier and Canada native was taken after the jihadists launched three suicide bombings in the area, and her condition is unknown.


The reports were not initially confirmed by the Islamic State group. In Israel, the Foreign Ministry said it was looking into the reports while stressing that the websites that carried the information were “of dubious credibility.”

Two Kurdish fighters quoted by Israel Radio cast doubt on the reports. One, an American fighter, said Rosenberg was never in Kobani. Another soldier on the ground said that he had heard nothing of her alleged abduction.

In her last Facebook post to date, Rosenberg wrote on November 20 that someone would be managing her profile for two weeks, and asked that people not message her “as this is not me.”

IS launched an attack Saturday on the Syrian border town of Kobani from Turkey, a Kurdish official and activists said, although Turkey denied that the fighters had used its territory for the raid.

The assault began when a suicide bomber driving an armored vehicle detonated an explosive device on the border crossing between Kobani and Turkey, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria’s powerful Kurdish Democratic Union Party.

The Islamic State group “used to attack the town from three sides,” Khalil said. “Today, they are attacking from four sides.”

The Islamic State group claimed three suicide attacks in Kobani’s border crossing point, the SITE Intelligence Group reported. The group, quoting Twitter accounts linked to the militants, said the suicide attacks were carried out by a Saudi and a Turkmen, adding that one of them was driving a Humvee.

The first foreign woman to join the Kurdish forces, Rosenberg set out from her home in Tel Aviv on November 2, stopping in Amman before flying to Erbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

Rosenberg told Israel Radio that she wanted to do her part for the Kurdish national struggle, and that she was hopeful her experience in the Israel Defense Forces would be useful to the Kurds.

According to Rosenberg’s Facebook page, she served in the IDF’s Home Front Command.

Rosenberg has posted pictures of herself in mountains of Iraq and Syrian Kurdistan.

“In the IDF, we say Aharai – After Me. Let’s show ISIS what that means,” she wrote, using an alternate acronym for Islamic State.

In 2009, Rosenberg was arrested in a joint Israeli police and FBI operation on suspicion that she had been part of a ring that cheated elderly American citizens out of their money by posing as lottery officials and convincing the unsuspecting seniors to pay for fictive services, according to the Walla news site. The members of the ring, which included 11 other Israeli citizens aside from Rosenberg, were said to have stolen up to $25 million.

Rosenberg was later convicted of the crime and sentenced to four years in a US prison, though her term was eventually shortened and she was deported to Israel instead, Channel 10 reported.

The Islamic State group began its Kobani offensive in mid-September, capturing parts of the town as well as dozens of nearby villages. The town later became the focus of airstrikes by the US-led coalition against the militants.

Kurdish fighters slowly have been advancing in Kobani since late October, when dozens of well-armed Iraqi peshmerga fighters joined fellow Syrian Kurds in the battles. The fighting has killed hundreds of fighters on both sides over the past two months.

If confirmed, Rosenberg would be the second Israeli captive held by the jihadist group. Israeli-American journalist Steven Sotloff was beheaded by the Islamic State group in early September. Sotloff went missing in Syria in August 2013, and the jihadists were reportedly unaware of his Jewish heritage and Israeli citizenship until after his death.

837,Senator: Detainees swapped for Bergdahl have contacted militants,"Amazon has warehouses — hundreds of them, miles of them. It has lockers and pop-up shipping containers. But it's never had a true, physical retail store, at least not until now. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Amazon plans to open its first physical store, and that it will be located in midtown Manhattan, right in the heart of New York City. It'll be located on 34th Street, right between the flagship Macy's store and the Empire State Building.

In a way, the store will reportedly be just an extension of what Amazon already does in its physical spaces. Amazon will accept returns at the location, and will use it as a mini-warehouse particularly tuned for same-day delivery of products in New York. You'll also be able to pick up online orders at the store, meaning you'll be able to buy online and get items even faster. Amazon may also use the store to show off its Kindle and Fire products, which seems like a spectacularly obvious thing to do but is evidently still only being considered.

Of course, there's potential to do much more. Amazon's been building to this: the company launched a tool for identifying products, a card-reader for buying them, and much more that suggests it could quickly build a full-fledged physical retail space. It's been rumored for years that Amazon would do this, and even now Amazon tells the Journal that this is just an experiment.

The store is apparently slated to be open in time for the holidays, and could be the beginning of an entirely new branch of competition between Amazon and its biggest brick-and-mortar competitors.",unrelated
838,Missing American journalist reportedly beheaded by Islamic State ,"Islamist militants claim to have beheaded a man identified as James Foley, an American journalist kidnapped in Syria in late 2012, in a graphic video posted on the internet.
A spokeswoman for the White House said the intelligence community was trying to determine the video’s authenticity. “If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American

The video entitled “Message to #America (from the #IslamicState)” purporting to show “James Wright Foley” on his knees ahead of his execution by a man whose identity is disguised and who speaks with a distinct British accent.


At the end of the video, the same person holds up a second person, who is identified with a caption on the screen as Steven Sotloff, a journalist kidnapped in 2013, and says: “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.”
Last week, social media accounts controlled by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or Isis, uploaded videos showing dozens of beheadings of individuals they accused of being sympathisers of the regime of Bashar al-Assad, President of Syria, in the northern Syrian town of Deir Ezzor.
The posting of the latest video by Isis comes days after President Barack Obama ordered an intensifying series of air strikes on the militants in northern Iraq.
The immediate aim of the strikes was to back Kurdish and Iraqi forces in their efforts to retake Mosul Dam, a strategic asset which the militants had gained control of in their recent military surge.
Mr Obama has said that Washington will not send troops to Iraq to engage Isis in combat but administration officials have expanded the US military mission there over the last week to halt and push back the militant’s advance.
“We believe that Isis needs to be taken out,” Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said this week.
An estimated 500 Britons have travelled to fight with extremist groups in Syria – most from London – and almost all have joined Isis, according to UK security officials.
British intelligence believes that several have travelled into Iraq and that some have almost certainly been involved in the worst of Isis’ atrocities.
The apparent murder of Mr Foley is a violent reminder of some of the most graphic crimes committed by Isis’s predecessor organisation, al-Qaeda in Iraq, which gruesomely beheaded dozens of Iraqis and foreigners, uploading videos of the acts to the internet, under the command of the militant group’s then leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, nearly a decade ago.
The beheading of American citizen Nicholas Berg in 2004 by Mr Zarqawi himself propelled AQI to the forefront of the war on terror and marked the beginning of a new particularly bloody phase in the Iraqi extremist insurgency in the wake of the US-led invasion.
AQI’s other high profile victims included Americans Jack Hensley and Eugene Armstrong, Briton Kenneth Bigley and South Korean Kim Sun Il.
Mr Zarqawi was killed in northern Iraq in 2006 in a US air strike, and AQI was subsequently driven underground by a surge in American troops in Iraq and a groundswell of Sunni support – financed by the West – in fighting the jihadi group.
The core of AQI’s ideological and operational beliefs and practices has survived in Isis however. The group has inherited many of the hallmarks of AQI, and has been posting videos of beheadings of Assad-regime soldiers and Iraqi Shia and Kurds online for months.
Early assessments by many in the Western intelligence community concluded that Isis was primarily a group focused on a violent regional and sectarian struggle.
With Isis’ declaration of a “caliphate” in June, however, and with it a direct challenge to what remains of al-Qaeda, many European and American security officials have grown more worried about its international ambitions.
Since air strikes against the group by the US began, intelligence officials have grown more worried over Isis’ attack planning against the West.
Of the estimated 3,000 Europeans who travelled to Syria to fight against Mr Assad’s regime, the majority have become Isis members and represent a potential terrorist risk to Western states.",discuss
839,"Pizza delivery man gets $2,000 tip","FEARS have been raised that Islamic State could target Britain with an EBOLA attack after two of the terror group's fighters reportedly contracted the deadly virus.

Sources at a hospital in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul say they have seen suspected cases involving two IS fighters.

They are believed to have unknowingly travelled from their African homelands with Ebola.

The news will spark fears that the jihadists could use the killer virus to hit Britain with so-called ""human-bug bombs"".

Intelligence experts have already urged authorities to be ready for members of the extremist outfit deliberately trying to spread Ebola in the West.

Even if a calculated plot does not emerge, experts fear Ebola could be accidentally spread by IS — also known as ISIS and ISIL — should it tear through the group's ranks.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) was last night scrambling to uncover more information about the Iraqi infection claims.

WHO officials have offered to assist the Iraqi government in investigating any potential outbreak.

However, experts are concerned that the lack of resources and doctors — caused by IS's bloody campaign in Syria and Iraq — could make cases impossible to probe and treat.

IS fighters have reportedly killed more than a dozen doctors, who may have been able to confirm the diagnoses, in Mosul.

Meanwhile Western medics, who would normally travel to the Middle East to help, face terrifying risks of kidnap and beheading by IS.

Ebola's potential appearance in Mosul was reported by three separate media outlets yesterday.

Mosul is 250 miles north of Baghdad and has been controlled by IS since June, 2014.

Al-Sabaah, an Iraqi newspaper, said two cases of Ebola and 26 of AIDS were reported in the city.

Citing medical sources, it claimed the virus had been transported from ""terrorists"" who came ""from several countries"" in Africa.

WHO director of communications Christy Feig said there has been ""no official notification"" from the Iraqi government that Ebola has been confirmed.

The organisation is trying to contact Iraqi officials to see if help can provided to investigate any suspected cases in rebel-controlled areas of the country.

Meanwhile a Kurdish official told media outlet Xendan the fighters’ symptoms were similar to those experienced by Ebola sufferers.

However, the effects of Ebola can resemble those caused by a number of illnesses, including malaria and Lassa and Yellow Fever.

They include nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, bleeding and bruising.

Middle East-based intelligence analyst Benjamin Decker said IS's killing of medics and its decision to ban Westerners from its territory could allow Ebola to spread rapidly.

He said: ""United Nations workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria.

""In this context the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.""

Hundreds of Britons are believed to have to travelled to join IS forces, with some already heading home.

Security and intelligence services monitor those who come back to see if they have renounced the terror network’s barbaric regime or whether they remain suspected terrorists plotting UK atrocities.

However, the current system may not equip security services for motoring symptoms of the Ebola, according to the WHO, has killed around 8,000 people in West Africa and affected areas so far.

IS is a hardline jihadist group, which formerly had ties to al-Qaeda.

It seized vest swathes of Iraq and Syria in August in a bid to create a so-called caliphate.

845,Durex Is Not Making Pumpkin Spice Condoms After All: A Hoax Debunked,"President Obama declared that the entire world was “appalled” by the beheading of an American journalist by militants in Syria, but vowed that America would not change course in Iraq, where the United States has been conducting airstrikes against terrorists, despite threats by the group to kill another reporter in the days ahead.

“The United States of America will continue to do what we must do to protect our people,” Mr. Obama said in a brief statement from Martha’s Vineyard, where he was vacationing. “We will be vigilant and we will be relentless.”

Before speaking to reporters, Mr. Obama said he placed a phone call to the parents of James Foley, the slain reporter, telling them that Americans were “are all heartbroken at their loss.” He described Mr. Foley as a “journalist, a son, a brother and a friend who was “taken from us in an act of violence that shocked the conscience of the entire world.”

But the president’s harshest and most emotional words were reserved for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the militants who released a video of the killing of Mr. Foley on Tuesday. American intelligence agencies on Wednesday verified the authenticity of the video, which shows a masked man decapitating James Foley, an American journalist who was kidnapped in Syria nearly two years ago. It also shows another American captive, the journalist Steven Sotloff, and warns that he would be the next to die.

The president called ISIS a “cancer” in the region and accused them of having “rampaged across cities and villages, killing unarmed civilians in cowardly acts of violence.” He said it had committed torture and rape against innocent women and children and continued to enslave those they did not kill.

“No faith teaches people to massacre innocents,” Mr. Obama said. “No just God would stand for what they did yesterday and what they do every single day. People like this ultimately fail. They fail because the future is won by people who build and not destroy.”

The killing of Mr. Foley triggered a fierce response. The New York Daily News and The New York Post both used the same banner headline on their front pages: “Savages.” Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain released a statement saying “the brutal murder of James Foley is shocking and depraved.”

At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement condemning ISIS for “the horrific murder of journalist James Foley, an abominable crime.” Mr. Ban said “the perpetrators of this and other such horrific crimes must be brought to justice.”

The four-minute, 40-second video was posted on YouTube but the website later took it down. Titled “A Message to America,” it shows Mr. Foley kneeling in a desert landscape, clad in an orange jumpsuit in an apparent reference to the uniforms worn by prisoners at the American military detention camp in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Standing to his left is a masked ISIS fighter who begins speaking in English, with what sounds like an East London accent. Pulling out a knife, he says that Mr. Foley’s execution is in retaliation for the recent American airstrikes ordered by Mr. Obama against the extremist group in Iraq.",unrelated
846,Macaulay Culkin Victim of Another Online Death Hoax,"WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon says U.S. officials have confirmed the death of the leader of the al-Shabaab terror group in a U.S. airstrike on Monday.

The Pentagon's press secretary confirmed the death of Ahmed Abdi Godane in a brief written statement Friday.
""Godane's removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al Qaeda affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals,"" the White House said in a statement.

U.S. officials had said after the strike on Monday that U.S. special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions. But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday.

Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is the group's spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al Qaeda.

The U.S. has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia recent years.

A U.S. missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabaab, and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a U.S. strike that killed al-Shabaab's top explosives expert.

Al-Shabaab gained international notoriety a year ago this month when it attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people. The U.S. strike on Monday targeted Godane and other planners of the bloody assault on the mall, officials said.",unrelated
847,"Apple Watch Stainless Steel variant reportedly priced at $500, $4,000 for the gold variant","Years ago, I had a job in China where I evaluated the spoken English of college students. One bright young woman introduced herself to me with her Chinese name. Then she added: ""You can call me 'Easy.' That's my English name.""

I paused, thought for a moment, and then decided to say something. ""You might want to consider changing your name,"" I said, explaining—as delicately as possible—that ""easy"" was an unfortunate name for a woman. Mortified, she thanked me for the tip. ""I'm going to go and change my name now,"" she said.

People in China have adopted English names for decades. Many choose ones that resemble their birth names: Chinese boys named ""Da Wei,"" a common name, almost invariably become ""David."" Others find inspiration from singers, athletes, politicians, or movie stars. In my first year in China, I taught five different boys called ""Tom Hanks,"" thanks in part to Castaway's success.

Most of the ""English"" names I encountered were conventional, though others—like the aforementioned ""Easy""—were less than appropriate. (I also taught a boy named ""Fish"" who, perhaps inspired by a certain musical artist, preferred to render his name by drawing it.)

Sweets-inspired names are ""typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.""
CCTV, China's state-run broadcaster, wants to solve this problem. In an article published by its English-language channel, the network laid out a series of guidelines for how not to name yourself. For example, avoid naming yourself after a food item (""Candy""), a famous person (""Obama""), or a very old person (""Gertrude""). If you name yourself ""Satan,"" says CCTV, people might think you're anti-Christian, or worse, a ""member of a heavy metal band."" Proper and traditional names, like ""Michael,"" ""William,"" and ""Elizabeth,"" on the other hand, imply you're from a fancy and conservative family. Sweets-inspired names are ""typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.""

One wonders if certain American celebrities might not also benefit from these guidelines. For instance, here's what CCTV has to say about using food as a name:

""Food is very hit or miss. And usually miss. One of the issues here is that food names can be 'very' suggestive.""

An official told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants’ symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus. Although the symptoms of Ebola, which include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, can easily be mistaken for many other illnesses such as malaria.

Christy Feig, WHO’s director of communications told Mashable they were in the process of reaching out to government officials in Iraq to see if help was needed investigating the cases.

850,Macaulay Culkin Dead? Another Death Hoax Circulates On Facebook,"When Tim Cook finally announced the long-awaited Apple Watch on September 9, the company promised an “early 2015” release. Since then, it’s really been anybody’s guess as to when, exactly, that might end up being. A few new rumors, however, suggest that we’ll get the Apple Watch sometime in February…but it’s likely that it’ll be later than that.

Today, a post on 9to5Mac points the way back to a report from Chinese site Feng, which itself cites “Taiwanese media” as saying that the Apple Watch is likely to hit sometime in February, though not without a fair bit of challenges to overcome. The reports say that the supply of sapphire crystal – which will compose the displays of the highest-end Apple Watch units – has led to some difficulties in manufacturing.

However, it should be noted that if sapphire is the biggest problem facing the Apple Watch, then Apple’s in good shape. The software itself is still in development, and as the 9to5Mac post points out, the company has yet to release the WatchKit SDK for developers to start making all the cool apps that’ll run on the device.

Another report from Asia this week claims that production on the Apple Watch isn’t set to start at manufacturing partner Quanta until sometime in January – and with only a month of actual production, it seems doubtful that Apple would truly be ready to sell the Watch by February. And last week, an unnamed Apple insider was quoted as saying that the company would be “lucky to ship it by Valentine’s Day.” If that quote is true, then February seems like a tall order.

That said, March doesn’t seem too out of the question. Nor does April. In fact, considering that Motorola promised the Moto 360 smartwatch by “summer 2014,” and didn’t launch it until early September, it would seem that OEMs are pretty loose about their definitions for launch windows. “Early 2015” is simply anything before the very last day in June. And barring any major disasters, we should start to see Apple Watches on consumers’ wrists long before then.

The main question, though, is what cool stuff will the competition cook up between then and now…",unrelated
851,"Jess Smith, 19, Claims She Was Teletubbies' Giggling Baby: What Did She Get Paid?","Amazon is reportedly planning to launch an ad-supported media streaming service for music and videos, the New York Post reports.

The service would exist in addition to its $99 Prime membership subscription, which includes free, two-day shipping on thousands of items alongside music, TV, and movie streaming options.

The Wall Street Journal reported similar plans in March, pegging the service as being free. At the time, Amazon denied that it had plans to offer a free streaming-media service.

The Post, however, doesn't say that the service would be free, and instead suggests that the new service would likely compete with Netflix and Hulu, while under-cutting them on price (Netflix costs and Hulu Plus cost $7.99 a month).

Amazon's Sally Fouts sent the following via email: ""We currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our First Episode Free feature on Amazon Instant Video, and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers. We’re often experimenting with new offers and experiences for customers, but we have not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service.""

At its core, the idea of this service makes sense.

Amazon could use this new, cheaper streaming service as a way to ease people into its ecosystem so they'll be more likely to eventually make the jump to Prime, while also giving it a way to entice potential customers who don't care about Prime's free shipping but want a Netflix alternative.

852,Shots Heard In Alleged Brown Shooting Recording [AUDIO],"TEXAS CITY — A local plumber is being flooded with phone calls — and some threats — after a picture of one of his old company vehicles being used by Islamist militants in Syria was posted on Twitter.
The picture was posted online by the Islamic extremist brigade Ansar al-Deen Front, according to a CBS News report. It shows a black pick-up truck with a Mark-1 Plumbing decal on the door and an anti-aircraft gun in the bed.
Mark Oberholtzer, who has owned and operated Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City for the past 32 years, confirmed it was his pickup truck in the picture. He said he no longer owned the vehicle and had no idea how it ended up in Syria.
Oberholtzer said he traded in the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago. He usually takes the decals off his vehicles when he sells them but he left it on this truck with the expectation that AutoNation would remove it.
“They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it,” Oberholtzer said. “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.”
He began receiving calls about the truck and the picture on Monday afternoon, Oberholtzer said. By Tuesday he said his business had received a thousand calls and faxes about the image.
“A few of the people are really ugly,” he said.
Derek Duckett, emergency management coordinator for Texas City, said he was unaware of any threats but was checking with local police to reach out to Mark 1 to see whether it needed assistance.
Oberholtzer said he didn’t know what to do about all the attention he was getting from the picture. He just wanted the public to know that the vehicle was no longer his.

853,God Is A Woman – Resurrected Father Narated,"Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, who went by the rap name L. Jinny or Lyricist Jinn, is a suspect in the beheading of journalist James Foley this week.

Bary, 24, is said to have left home last year to join rebels in Syria. According to TMZ, he had music played on the BBC.

The Independent newspaper reported that he tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head earlier in August. ”Chillin’ with my homie or what’s left of him,” he tweeted.

Ex-ISIS hostages have said that he has the nickname “John the Beatle” because of his British accent. Some analysts have said that the killer in the Foley video had a British accent.

Bary had lived in Maida Vale, located in west London, reported the Independent.

His father was Adel Abdul Bary, an Egyptian refugee who is said to have been an aide to Osama bin Laden.

In tracks he uploaded to YouTube in 2012, Bary talks about violence and drug use. ”It’s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,” he said in one of his tracks. ”I’m trying to change my ways but there’s blood on my hands and I can’t change my ways until there’s funds in the bank.

He added: “I can’t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart’s disintegrating. I ain’t got normal feelings.”

The Associated Press update: Obama again faces tug of military action in Syria WASHINGTON (AP) — For three years, President Barack Obama has resisted the pull of potential U.S. military action in Syria.

He has held firm even as the civil war’s death toll climbed toward 200,000, the Syrian government used chemical weapons against civilians and Islamic State militants strengthened amid the chaos.

Now Obama must decide whether the extremist group’s murder of American journalist James Foley, as well as the broader threat the group could pose to U.S. interests, should change his cautious calculus.

Pressure is coming from his own military leaders to go after the Islamic State inside Syria. But he must weigh that against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the United States into a country torn apart by an intractable internal conflict.

White House officials have suggested that airstrikes in Syria are an option, though the officials say specific military proposals has not yet been presented to the president.

“We’re actively considering what’s going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and we’re not going to be restricted by borders,” said Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser. “We’ve shown time and again that if there’s a counterterrorism threat, we’ll take direct action against that threat, if necessary.”

Even before Foley’s murder, Obama found himself on far different footing in the Middle East than he probably expected in the sixth year of his presidency.

After running for the White House on a pledge to end the Iraq war and then making good on that promise in late 2011, Obama thrust the U.S. military back into Iraq this month with a limited airstrike campaign against Islamic State targets.

Obama has said he will not send U.S. combat troops to another ground war in the Mideast. But expanding the airstrikes in Iraq and broadening them to include Syria could mean a lengthy American military commitment in the region that could consume much of Obama’s remaining time in office.

“What we should have learned over the past dozen years in that part of the world is that the use of military power is very unpredictable,” said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.

That may be particularly true in Syria, where President Bashar Assad’s government is warring with opposition forces. Unlike in Iraq, the battle lines are more clearly drawn. Syria has a host of military players in close proximity to each other, including the Islamic State, the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, mainstream Western-backed rebels and pro-government forces.

The Islamic State is among the groups fighting Assad, meaning a U.S. campaign to weaken the extremists could actually strengthen a leader the White House has sought to push from office.

Obama could try to counteract that uncomfortable dynamic by also taking strikes against Assad, though that could put the U.S. on the hook for the kind of long-term commitment to rebuilding Syria that he has tried to avoid.

The risks are no less troubling if Obama allows the Islamic State to continue having unfettered access to a safe haven in Syria. Politically, it could bolster the argument from his critics that he is overseeing an American retreat on the world stage. It also could give the militants space to strengthen and become a threat not just to U.S. interests in the region, but also to the U.S. at home.

Obama’s own military leadership made clear in recent days that the threat from the Islamic State cannot be fully eliminated without going after the group in Syria, as well as Iraq.

“This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,” said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in Syria? The answer is no. That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.”

To White House critics, the unappetizing options are the result of Obama’s own foreign policy missteps. They argue that he gave extremists an opening in Iraq by not doing more to reach an agreement with the Iraqi government to leave U.S. forces in the country after 2011. They say his decision to not provide heavy weaponry to more moderate rebel groups in Syria also helped facilitate the Islamic State’s rise.

Without a course correction, Obama’s critics argue, the U.S. will be at greater risk.

“If we do not do more to assist our Iraqi partners and those moderate Syrians who are fighting ISIL and directly target ISIL’s leadership and networks in Iraq and Syria, I fear that James Foley will not be the only American to die at their hands,” said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State.

Obama’s advisers say the responsibility for stemming the rise of the Islamic State does not rest solely with the United States. The White House has been imploring Sunni states in the region — Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates in particular — to wield their influence with tribal leaders in Iraq and get them to push the Islamic State out of areas they have occupied.

The U.S. also has been discussing ways that allies such as Britain, France, Australia and Canada can become involved through intelligence sharing, military assistance for Kurdish forces in Iraq and moderate opposition forces in Syria, and if necessary, joining the U.S. in military action.",unrelated

North Korean citizens hoping to name themselves after Kim Jong-Un in the near future are out of luck, because the leader has banned the use of his moniker, and ordered those who already have it to be “trained” to change it.

According to the Daily Mail, South Korean television obtained a leaked internal document from the state that included an “administrative order” to army, police and government officials to establish the new legislation.

“All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-Un... and train them to voluntarily change their names,” it reportedly reads.

Those caught with the name Kim Jong-Un, it continued, would have their identity cards, school diplomas and official documents briskly adjusted.

Birth certificates baring the dictator’s name would also be rejected.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip... regarding this project,” the Mail further quotes the document as reading.

A spokesperson from the North Korean Embassy in London declined to comment on the authenticity of the report.

However, a South Korean official claimed that the two previous presidents of the secret state, Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, similarly banned the sharing of their names.

“There is a possibility that it would continue to do so now,” he added.

The document was first obtained by Park Jin-Hee, a North Korean defector working for the KBS, who left the state in 2008.

“There is no one in the North named Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-Un,” she said.

The 12-inch laptop would be substantially smaller and lighter than the 13-inch model, and even slightly smaller than the 11-inch version. This is thanks to slimmer bezels and a slightly more compact keyboard with less separate between keys. 9to5Mac doesn’t have details on exactly how high the resolution will be, but the current Airs are sitting at 1366 x 768 (11-inch) and 1440 x 900 (13-inch).

Performed the ultrasound, the truth was immediately clear and the nun, Sunday, was transferred in obstetrics, where a few hours after she gave birth to a child.

And for those that might claim any type of police cover-up in regards to the theft of the Batmobile, the Detroit Free Press also confirmed with sources close to the production that the Ben Affleck’s ride had not been stolen.

862,David Haines beheading video confirmed genuine; UK PM Cameron vows to hunt down ISIS 'monsters',"The North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has not been seen in public for more than a month, leading to rumors his sister has taken over while the Supreme Leader fights an illness or sits under house arrest.

Where is Kim Jong Un?

The saber-rattling North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month, spurring rumors he is ill and leading to speculation over who — if anyone — has filled the power vacuum in Pyongyang.

But there's one atom bomb of a theory being mentioned by Korea watchers that's quickly gaining currency.

Analysts believe 27-year-old Kim Yo Jong, the seventh and youngest of Kim Jong Il's children with four women, has risen rapidly within the regime and may be secretly running the Hermit Kingdom — for now.

Little Kim reportedly went to the same Swiss boarding school with Kim Jong Un and has held positions within the North Korean government since her father was in power.

""If in fact she is running the country — as someone in their early- to mid-20s — to me that is quite alarming,"" Center for Strategic and International Studies analyst Victor Cha told CNN. ""It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.""

State TV showed Kim Jong Un uncharacteristically walking with a noticeable limp in July at the 20th anniversary memorial commemorating the death of his grandfather, the nation's founder.

After the Supreme Leader's recent vanishing act, health theories have abounded. Kim is ill with everything from gout and a cheese addiction to ankle problems and diabetes. State media called what ails Kim ""discomfort"" in a Sept. 26 report.

He may even be under house arrest, according to Remco Breuker, professor of Korean studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

""We're not sure where he is, or what's happening,"" Breuker told the ABC News. ""We don't know whether he's in the hospital or whether he's been put under house arrest.""

Kim Jong Un, whose pal Dennis Rodman said is 31, saw his waistline balloon since he ascended to power in late 2011, analysts note.

Sis Kim Yo Jong is a senior official in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. But her role might have expanded dramatically if Kim Jong Un is incapacitated.

""She is one of the only people in (North Korea) that we know has unfettered direct access to KJU. At the present time I would not be surprised if she is sole gatekeeper,"" North Korea Leadership Watch blog's Michael Madden told NBC News.

Korea watchers point to Friday's anniversary of the founding of the Ruling Workers Party. If Kim Jong Un doesn't show, expect speculation to reach fever pitch.

868,"It's 'rubbish' that Robert Plant turned down £500m Led Zeppelin reformation offer, says publicist","Sorry to disappoint, fans of Led Zeppelin, but it doesn’t look like a reunion will be happening any time soon.

According to a report from UK publication The Mirror, the group’s famed lead singer Robert Plant literally tore up a contract to reunite the band worth almost $800 million, saying the timing just wasn’t right for a reunion tour.

Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin brand fame was apparently behind the entire thing, offering the band an obscene amount of money just to reunite for a few dozen shows. The contract was reportedly for 35 shows in three cities: London, Berlin, and an unnamed location in New Jersey. Each of the three remaining original members would have earned somewhere over $200 million each just for performing, while another $100 million in merchandising profits was to be shared between the group members.

English: Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin

Branson was reportedly also ready to supply the group with their own private jet for the tour. The mogul was prepared to take one of his airline’s planes and rebrand it “The Starship”. The contract also had an extension option to add 45 more shows in additional venues should the band agree.

The other two original members of the group apparently signed on immediately, and Jason Bonham, the son of late drummer John Bonham, was set to step in for his father. Plant apparently met with conert promoters to discuss the deal, and during the meeting actually ripped the contract in two, ending any chance of a regrouping.


While $800 million is certainly a lot of money, it’s not like Robert Plant (or any of the other members for that matter) really need it. Led Zeppelin are one of the most successful groups of all time, having sold around 112 million records in the United States alone (that figure is three or four times that when the entire planet is counted). In fact, they are the fourth best-selling music act in American history, right behind The Beatles, Elvis Presley, and Garth Brooks.

Robert Plant has also had an incredibly successful career outside of Led Zeppelin. He has released fourteen albums, selling additional millions and making his chart history that much more impressive. His collaborative album Raising Sand with bluegrass/country singer Alison Krauss may not have been his most commercially successful, but it was adored universally by critics, and won he, Alison, and producer T-Bone Burnett five Grammys back in 2009, including Record of the Year and Album of the Year.

While the band’s last album of original music, Coda, was released back in 1982, the band has continued to sell well throughout the years, making millions in repackagings, reissues and live album releases. The group’s last show together was in London back in December of 2007, which was a tribute to legendary music executive Ahmet Ertegün. The concert is thought to have had the most-desired tickets of any show in history, as when it was announced, 20 million requests were submitted online for passes.",discuss

Rogen's role in the highly anticipated Sony production was revealed on Thursday by film industry publication Variety. Rogen will star opposite Christian Bale, who will play the role of Steve Jobs.

The project has attracted top-level talent, as it will be directed by Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for Best Director in 2008 for the film ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Sorkin won his Academy Award in 2011 for ""The Social Network,"" while Bale won Best Supporting Actor in 2011 for his performance in ""The Fighter.""

Sorkin's script is expected to be loosely based on Walter Isaacson's official Jobs biography. The screenwriter has said the movie will consist of scenes that take place before the unveilings of three key products: the original Mac, NeXT and the iPod.

Wozniak left Apple in early 1987, which would put him at the company for just the launch of the original Mac. But Sorkin's films are not known to stick closely to historical facts, as seen in his depiction of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in ""The Social Network.""

Twenty years ago, opening statements in the OJ Simpson trial were being heard, a company called AOL rolled out Internet service, and two Aussie blokes purchased a hamburger from a local McD's. Two of those three things changed dramatically; one didn't, and in another 20 years that burger offering will no doubt still be going strong in all its wrinkled, uber-preserved glory.

According to 9News.com out of Australia, friends Casey Dean and Eduard Nitz, only 13 and 14 years old at the time, bought some burgers at an Adelaide McDonald's two decades ago. They ate their burgers, but a quarter pounder with cheese they bought for a friend went uneaten.

No worries -- the friend asked the boys to hold onto the burger until the next time he was in the city. Either the friend never returned, or the burger turned into a bit of an inside joke; either way, the teens turned into adults, but the burger refused to age.

""We're pretty sure it's the oldest burger in the world,"" Dean said. ""It started off as a joke, you know. We told our friend we would hold his burger for him but he never showed up, and before we knew it six months had passed.""

Those months turned into years and now, 20 years later, the burger ""looks the same as the day we bought it, perfectly preserved it its original packaging,"" Dean said.

The pair were featured on Australia's Channel 10 news, threatening to finally take a nosh. Even though it was for charity, the trustees of the burger just couldn't bring themselves to bite into it. Can you blame them? All of which begs the question: Exactly what is in a McDonald's burger that keeps it looking the same, 20 year later?",unrelated

In the video, which was temporarily available on YouTube but has since been removed, the terrorists remind the audience Obama authorized military action against IS and replayed Obama’s press conference when he announced the airstrikes. To them the declaration is a “slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims.”
Foley then appears on his knees in an orange jumpsuit. He relays a message that the US government is his true killer. He addresses his family as well. The message is choppy, which gives the appearance that he is reading off cards placed in front of the camera.
His executioner speaks with what appears to be a British accent, saying many Muslims worldwide accepted IS and a war against IS is, in essence, a war against Muslims. The UK has been one of the Islamic State's most active targets of recruitment.
After he beheads Foley, he presents to the camera another journalist, Steven Joel Soltoff, who worked for Time and The National Interest. Soltoff was reported missing in the middle of last year. The executioner said America’s next move will determine IS’s next move in what appears to be a threat against the second journalist.
Foley was an independent journalist in the Middle East. In 2011, he was one of four journalists kidnapped by Qaddafi’s forces in Libya, of which he said in an interview with the Boston Globe, “You don’t want to be defined as that guy who got captured in 2011... believe that front-line journalism is important.” He spoke at Northwestern University about his experience in Libya.

875,Would-be rapist has penis severed by angry mob,"The Apple Watch reveal back in September was big on excitement, but short on details. Among those things that Apple failed to mention was whether or not Cupertino’s new smartwatch will be able to withstand liquids — making it suitable for, say, swimming or washing the dishes.

While we still don’t have a final, definitive answer on what is and is not advisable with the Apple Watch, Tim Cook shed a bit of light on the mystery during a Q&A session with staff at the Kurfürstendamm Apple Store in Berlin, Germany, where he is currently visiting. Cook said that that he wears his Apple Watch “even in the shower.”

This is in contrast with what we had previously heard, courtesy of tech journalist David Pogue, who after a private briefing with Apple advised readers that, “Sweating [while wearing the Apple Watch], wearing it in the rain, washing your hands, or cooking with it is fine. Take it off before the swim or get in the shower, though.”

As much as we respect Pogue, you’d have to say that — when it comes to Apple advice — Cook trumps Pogue!

The Apple CEO also answered a few other questions in what sounds like an interesting session. Among them was a bit more clarification on the Apple Watch’s battery life, with Cook saying he removes the device to recharge overnight — something we’ve suspected based on previous reports.

Cook talked about some of the possible applications of the Apple Watch, including monitoring auctions on eBay — or else accessing hotel rooms in a way similar to existing apps for the iPhone.

Answering a question from a visually impaired employee, he said that the Apple Watch will have more accessibility features added over time, although it sounds like these features will be limited at first.

No price tariff was given for the device, but Cook confirmed that Apple will begin marketing the device in April. In what sounds like an amusing moment, Cook sidestepped the question of whether retail staff could have all have an Apple Watch to more easily show customers, by saying that it is a “good idea” and that he would “consider it.”

Cook also spoke about his efforts to improve working conditions in China, and lamented the fact that the media often choose to paint Apple in a bad light in this regard. Cook said that Apple is trying to ensure that there is no abuse of employees on the supply chain, and that they work fairer numbers of hours.

""It should be noted that there is no independent confirmation regarding the authenticity of the clip which was posted on YouTube showing the boy dressed in military fatigues and carrying weapons,"" the Post reported.

Those who've watched the clip have expressed ""disgust over the use of children in warfare,"" it continued.

ISIS was formed last year from the group al-Qaida in Iraq and is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. They have garnered international attention for their atrocities in Northern Iraq and civil war torn Syria.

Known as the ""Cub of Baghdadi,"" the 10-year-old al-Abassi was a native of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

For its part, Saudi Arabia's top religious official has denounced ISIS, calling them in recent statements enemies of Islam and civilization.

Saudi Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh issued the statement in August via the Saudi Press Agency.

""Extremist and militant ideas and terrorism which spread decay on earth, destroying human civilization,"" said al-Sheikh, ""are not in any way part of Islam, but are enemy number one of Islam, and Muslims are their first victims.""

877,Does ISIS Have Ebola? Probably Not! Media Reports It Anyway,"The two biggest news stories of 2014 collided Wednesday when Iraqi media outlets reported that members of the Islamic State group -- also known as ISIS -- had contracted the deadly virus Ebola. But later updates from the World Health Organization and Iraq's Ministry of Health indicate the stories may be just rumors.

""We have no official notification ... that it is Ebola,"" Christy Feig, director of communications for WHO, told Mashable, though WHO has contacted Iraqi officials to offer help.

Iraq's Ministry of Health also denied that anyone in Mosul had contracted the Ebola virus, which broke out in March in West Africa. Spokesman Ahmed Rudaini told news site Al-Maalomah that Mosul doesn't even have the technological capability to diagnose Ebola cases -- only Baghdad does. Therefore, he said, the reports that Ebola has infected anyone in Mosul are ""incorrect"" and ""unfounded.""

The discussion started with an article in Iraq's official newspaper, Al-Sabah, that said ""terrorists"" brought Ebola to Mosul. ""Many diseases and epidemics have spread among residents of the city of Mosul,"" it read. ""Two Ebola and 26 HIV/AIDS cases were registered.""

Ebola is primarily a threat in West Africa, where its latest outbreak has killed nearly 8,000 people. Mashable reported ISIS has not recruited fighters from any countries severely affected by the disease. Its African members are primarily from Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia.

In the event ISIS does have Ebola, the militants could use it as a biological terror technique, Forbes reported in October. Members could contract the virus on purpose and then go to foreign countries to infect others. “The individual exposed to the Ebola virus would be the carrier,” national security professor Al Shimkus told Forbes. “In the context of terrorist activity, it doesn’t take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier.”

ISIS, a body of militants labeled a terrorist group by the United States and European Union (among others), has controlled Mosul since June. Iraq's second-largest city is also ISIS' largest stronghold. The group began spreading across the Middle East last summer, taking over large swaths of Iraq and Syria through brutal tactics.",agree
878,One of 'Taliban Five' in Bowe Bergdahl swap allegedly returned to militancy,"A Guantanamo Bay prisoner released last year as part of an exchange for captured US serviceman Bowe Bergdahl has resumed contact with the Taliban, according to reports.

The former detainee - one of five men released in a controversial deal which saw the return of the US PoW from Afghanistan - is said to have been in touch with members of the al-Qaeda linked Haqqani network.

This is the first suggestion that any of the detainees involved in the swap may be trying to engage again in militant activity.

The five, who mostly held mid- to high-level positions within the Taliban before their capture during the early days of the US-led war in Afghanistan, were detained because of their association with the terror group.

Since their release they have been living in Qatar, which promised to monitor the men on behalf of the US.

The Pentagon said Thursday that it is working with Qatar and is confident that any threat posed by the former detainees can be mitigated.

US Sen Lindsey Graham, who recently visited Qatar, said he had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country, but said he was assured during his visit that all five remain in the small Gulf nation.

Qatar gained public praise from President Barack Obama for brokering the controversial deal in May 2014 that freed Army Sgt. Bergdahl from Taliban captivity in exchange for the release of the five senior Taliban officials who had been imprisoned for years at the US-run Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.

Qatar promised Mr Obama it would keep the five under watch for one year, although they would then be free to leave.

""It's just a year deal,"" Mr Graham told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ""Just as sure as we're sitting here, they're going back to the fight.""

""They've had some Haqqani people come to meet with them. ... They're reaching out. The Taliban five are communicating with people inside Afghanistan.""

However, Mr Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a leading Capitol Hill voice on foreign policy, said all five are still in Qatar.

""I was afraid one had left, but they told me they're all still there,"" he said.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it would not comment on specific cases involving the detainees.

""However, we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously, and we work in close coordination through military, intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary,"" the statement said. ""The Defense Department has a close security partnership with the government of Qatar.

879,"IS Beheads Briton David Cawthorne Haines, Threatens to Execute Another Briton, Alan Henning","Brian Williams took a moment during Monday’s edition of NBC Nightly News to address a very important issue. As the anchor said, social media, as well as a few news websites, owes meteorologist Mike Seidel an “apology” after some “wild misinformation” circulated about what he was doing during a live appearance with Lester Holt over the weekend.

Williams explained that Seidel has lost communication with the NBC station and couldn’t hear Holt through his earpiece so he turned his back to the camera, took off his gloves and redialed his phone to connect for the segment.

“That’s when the rumors hit the web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow,” Williams said. “It was just Mike working to make it right, which is why we all love working with Mike Seidel.”

But, of course, that explanation is far less hilarious and would likely generate almost zero clicks.

881,Give a homeless man $100 and see what he does with it [Video],"Militants from Islamic State (Isis) claimed to have killed an American journalist long held captive in Syria in retaliation for ongoing US airstrikes against its forces in Iraq.

A propaganda video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man dressed in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Wright Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012.

The masked executioner spoke in English, with what sounded like a British accent, and said that the slaying came in response to the airstrikes ordered by President Barack Obama against Isis 12 days ago.

Isis, whose chief spokesman came under State Department sanctions on Monday, warned of further revenge – including on another man purported to be a captured US journalist, Steven Sotloff – and in the video, the victim was made to read a statement blaming the US for his own murder.

Foley has been missing in Syria since November 2012, where he went to report on the bloody struggle to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. He was initially thought to have been captured by forces loyal to the Assad regime.

A Facebook message from a support group, Free James Foley, urged patience “until we all have more information,” and asked that readers “keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

YouTube took down the gruesome video, but not before it sparked a debate on social media about the ethics of sharing it, adding a metatextual debate to a depiction of a man’s violent death.

Foley, 40, a former Stars and Stripes reporter, was captured in November 2012 near the Syrian town of Taftanaz. It was not his first detention while reporting: in 2011, he was taken while reporting on the uprising against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi’s forces ultimately released him after six weeks in captivity.

A friend of Foley’s and his fellow captive in Libya, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote in a 2013 essay that captivity was “the state most violently opposite his nature.” Gillis described Foley as gentle, friendly, courageous and impatient with “anything that slows his forward momentum.”

In a January 2013 interview with local television news near her Rochester, New Hampshire home, Foley’s mother Diane said her son was “passionate about covering the story in Syria, passionate about the people there.”

Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said US intelligence was working to determine the authenticity of the video.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said in a statement.

Messages left with the Foley family were not returned.

A day after Obama declared that Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US warplanes had broken Isis’ hold on the critical Mosul Dam, US Central Command announced two strikes near it on Monday, to “further expand control of the area.” One strike was said to have destroyed an Isis checkpoint while the other was “not successful.”

Obama has offered no timeframe for the length of his campaign against Isis. The US military has bombed over 90 targets attributed to Isis, including vehicle convoys, mobile artillery and fixed positions, since 8 August. Most of the strikes have come in the past few days, near the dam. The other strikes have occurred either to blunt an Isis advance on the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil or to lift an Isis siege on Mount Sinjar, where it chased thousands of Iraqi Yazidis whom it threatened to kill unless they converted to Islam.

The British Isis militant known as Jihadi John has been identified in reports today as Mohammed Emwazi, from London.

In a lengthy article by The Washington Post, identifying the man suspected of appearing in videos showing the beheading of US and UK hostages, a 2010 report in The Independent is cited, which details claims that Emwazi was detained for 'days' and illegally interrogated by MI5 while on a safari holiday in Africa, before being let go.

It has now been claimed Emwazi started to become radicalised following the events on this trip.

Below is the full report, in which Emwazi is identified as Muhammad ibn Muazzam, from The Independent on Saturday, 01 May, 2010.

British Muslims on safari 'stopped by MI5' (from The Independent on 01/05/2010)

MI5 agents illegally interrogated British Muslims who were detained while on safari holidays in Africa, it was claimed yesterday.

The new allegations mirror cases first raised by The Independent last year in which the security service was accused of harassing and intimidating north London community workers who had returned from Somalia.

Now two British men from west London who visited Tanzania for a week-long safari in May last year say they were arrested and held for “days” in inhumane detention on the orders of MI5.

Abu Talib and Muhammad ibn Muazzam, both in their mid-20s, and a German friend travelling with them, allege they were threatened with beatings by members of Tanzania's security forces. After being refused entry to Tanzania they were returned to the Netherlands, where they say they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists.

On their return to the UK the next day, the men allege they were harassed by MI5, who warned them they were now on a terror watch list which prevented them travelling to any Muslim country. Another British citizen, Abu Omar, 19, says that in April 2009 his safari holiday to Kenya was interrupted when the house in which he was staying was raided by local security officers.

Mr Omar claims he was held and questioned for four days, also on the basis of intelligence supplied by MI5. He alleges that his interrogators threw a mobile phone at him which they said had his fingerprints on and was linked to phone calls made to Osama bin Laden. Back in London Mr Omar was further questioned by MI5, who took his fingerprints and photographs.

He told the human rights group Cageprisoners: ""I was left in the airport without money, barefoot and my clothes in bin liners.""

The new cases bear striking similarities to allegations made by six youth workers from Kentish Town who allege that they too were harassed and unlawfully interrogated after holidays abroad in 2008. Cageprisoners' executive director, Asim Qureshi, said: ""The last seven years of the 'War on Terror' have seen the profiling and criminalisation of the Arab and Pakistani communities by UK authorities around the world. The policies implemented through counter-terrorism legislation and Prevent [the Government's strategy for combating extremism in the Muslim community] have been counter-productive as Muslim communities feel marginalised. Many Muslims feel besieged and the policies of Government have done nothing to temper that.""

883,Audio recording allegedly captures moment Michael Brown was shot,"At least 25 suspected Boko Haram insurgents were killed in clashes between soldiers and the Islamist militants in northeast Nigeria and five civilians were killed in fighting elsewhere in the region, a military source and residents said on Monday.

A ceasefire agreement between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government was expected to lead to the liberation of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the militants six months ago, and talks were due to continue in neighbouring Chad on Monday.

Boko Haram has not confirmed the truce and there have been at least six attacks over the weekend – blamed by security sources on the insurgents – that have killed several dozen people since the announcement of the ceasefire.

A government spokesman has said that the fighting on Sunday may be the work of criminal gangs in the lawless region.

An army officer, who requested anonymity, said the militants tried to enter the town of Damboa late on Sunday through Alagarno, a Boko Haram hideout, but soldiers fought them off. “Our men gunned down 25 of the insurgents because they would have entered Damboa and unleashed more terror on the town that is just picking up from its ruins,” the officer said.

He said an armoured vehicle and some arms were recovered from the insurgents.

Damboa, a garrison town near the border with Cameroon, has been the site of fierce fighting between the militants and Nigerian forces for months. The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive.

A member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, “Two of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.”

Separately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa.

Tada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain.

“My brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children,” he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone.

“They [the militants] came yesterday [Sunday] while people were scouting for food at the foot of the mountain. When the insurgents sighted our people, they pursued them and slaughtered five,” Tada said.",unrelated
884,"Meteorite Strikes Nicaraguan Capital, Creates 16-Foot-Deep Crater","A meteorite landed ""like a bomb"" just missing Nicaragua's main airport and raising concerns over scientists' ability to track space objects on potential collision courses with Earth.

Officials said they ""thanked God"" there were no injuries as the rock landed in Managua, a sprawling city of 1.2 million people where it left a crater 12 metres (40ft) wide and five metres (16ft) deep.

The object was believed to have been a small part of the asteroid 2014 RC, nicknamed ""Pitbull,"" which astronomers had been monitoring as it passed the planet.

Nasa currently tracks more than 11,000 asteroids that come relatively close to Earth but 2014 RC, which is the size of a large house, was only discovered on Aug 31.

It moved within 25,000 miles of the Earth's surface and had been projected to be at its nearest point over New Zealand on Sunday.

The meteorite that apparently originated from 2014 RC landed in a wooded area just before midnight on Saturday.

Its impact registered on instruments used to detect earthquakes, which regularly hit Nicaragua.

People living nearby head an an explosion and described seeing liquid, sand and dust blowing thought the air, and the smell of burning.

Jorge Santamaria, who lives near the airport, said: ""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave.""

Jose Millan, of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies, said: ""We need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population.

""All the evidence that we've confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event.""

Nicaragua said it would be asking for assistance from international scientists, including those from the United States, to investigate.

The composition of the meteorite has yet to be determined and it was not clear if it had disintegrated on hitting the ground or been buried under the ground.

Wilfredo Strauss of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies, said: ""We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact.

""You can see two waves on the seismic equipment). First, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit Earth, and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound.""

Rosario Murillo, Nicaragua's First Lady and Government spokeswoman, said the object ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.""

In February 2013 a meteor that had not previously been detected by scientists exploded over Chelyabinsk in Central Russia, injuring more than 1,000 people.

Dr Dan Brown, an astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, said: ""The possible meteorite impact in Nicaragua, linked with the asteroid 2014 RC which flew by Earth raises some interesting questions.

""Although the impact occurred roughly 12 hours before the asteroid passed Earth, that part of the planet was facing in the right direction for it to have been a fragment associated with it.

""If it was an unrelated object, however, then it further demonstrates how we don't really monitor all the potentially dangerous rocks out there.""",agree
885,"Nigeria, Boko Haram reach ceasefire deal, kidnapped girls to go free, official says","More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in April, sparking the #BringBackOurGirls campaign

A top military official in Nigeria was reported Friday to have announced a cease-fire between the government and the military group Boko Haram, igniting both skepticism and hopes that more than 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped in April would be released.

The truce was said to be announced by Air Marshall Alex Badeh, Nigeria’s chief of defense, the Associated Press reports. The release of the girls is still being negotiated, Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade added, but the cease-fire would begin immediately and could take take several days to reach the groups of militants.

“Already, the terrorists have announced a cease-fire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a cease-fire,” said Mike Omeri, a government spokesman on Boko Haram, at a news conference. The AP adds that Omeri confirmed negotiations about the girls’ potential release were held throughout the week.

Reports of the deal were met with hesitation by those who have followed the saga since the girls were abducted from their school in Chibok on April 14. There was neither an official statement quickly released by the government, nor an announcement made by the insurgent group, the New York Times reports.

Boko Haram, which released a video in May that claimed responsibility for the girls’ abductions and vowed to “sell them on the market, by Allah,” has previously demanded the release of rebel prisoners in exchange for their freedom. But Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who has faced intense global pressure to free the students, said that’s a trade he will not make. The Nigerian government has in the past misled the public about the girls’ status; its fight against Boko Haram has been fraught with challenges since the militant group rose up in 2009, from inefficiency and corruption in the military to lax local support in the northern communities that are threatened most.

In August, the Wall Street Journal reported that American surveillance planes spotted groups that appeared to be the missing girls, suggesting that not all of them had been sold into marriage or slavery — as feared — and that some were perhaps being kept as a bargaining tactic.",discuss
886,ISIS chlorine attack on security forces confirmed – Iraq officials,"A McDonald's burger bought 20 years ago has an uncanny resemblance to its modern day counterpart. Twenty years ago, opening statements in the OJ Simpson trial were being heard, a company called AOL rolled out Internet service, and two Aussie blokes purchased a hamburger from a local McD's. Two of those three things changed dramatically; one didn't, and in another 20 years that burger offering will no doubt still be going strong in all its wrinkled, uber-preserved glory.

According to 9News.com out of Australia, friends Casey Dean and Eduard Nitz, only 13 and 14 years old at the time, bought some burgers at an Adelaide McDonald's two decades ago. They ate their burgers, but a quarter pounder with cheese they bought for a friend went uneaten.

No worries -- the friend asked the boys to hold onto the burger until the next time he was in the city. Either the friend never returned, or the burger turned into a bit of an inside joke; either way, the teens turned into adults, but the burger refused to age.

""We're pretty sure it's the oldest burger in the world,"" Dean said. ""It started off as a joke, you know. We told our friend we would hold his burger for him but he never showed up, and before we knew it six months had passed.""

Those months turned into years and now, 20 years later, the burger ""looks the same as the day we bought it, perfectly preserved it its original packaging,"" Dean said.

The pair were featured on Australia's Channel 10 news, threatening to finally take a nosh. Even though it was for charity, the trustees of the burger just couldn't bring themselves to bite into it. Can you blame them? All of which begs the question: Exactly what is in a McDonald's burger that keeps it looking the same, 20 year later?",unrelated
887,Oscar winner Christian Bale to play Steve Jobs in upcoming biopic,"Cristian Bale is eyeing — or i-ing, if you prefer — the role of Apple founder Steve Jobs.

The 40-year-old English actor is in talks to play the charismatic tech genius who gave the world the iMac, the iPod and the iPhone in Sony's upcoming biopic, The Times has confirmed. The Hollywood Reporter broke the news.

Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire,"" ""Trainspotting"") is directing the film, which may be called ""Jobs,"" from a script by Aaron Sorkin, who won a screenwriting Oscar for the Facebook drama ""The Social Network"" (released by Sony in 2010). Sorkin's screenplay is based on Walter Isaacson's bestselling biography ""Steve Jobs,"" acquired by Sony around the time of Jobs' death in October 2011.

The film has had a few twists and turns: Leonardo DiCaprio previously circled the Jobs role but ultimately passed, and ""Gone Girl"" director David Fincher was in talks to helm the film at one point.

Even with Bale, the Jobs biopic still faces questions, particularly over whether audiences will continue to be fascinated by Jobs. While no doubt a towering, relevant figure in both technology and culture, those two areas are characterized by swiftly moving currents, and it remains to be seen where mass interest lies when the film eventually comes out.

Rather than take a traditional cradle-to-grave approach, Sorkin said at a 2012 Newsweek and Daily Beast event that the ""entire movie is going to be three scenes, and three scenes only, that all take place in real time."" He added, ""Each of these three scenes is going to take place before a product launch — backstage before a product launch. The first one being the Mac; and the second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple; and the third one being the iPod.""",discuss
888,"Nun gives birth, intends to keep baby","He’s being called a hero for shooting a rampaging gunman dead on Parliament Hill — and it may mark the first time Sergeant-At-Arms Kevin Vickers has ever fired a gun in the line of duty.

“This the first time in his career that he’s shot anyone,” said Erin, Vickers’ niece.

A retired RCMP officer who once served in Calgary, 58-year-old Vickers is known to most Canadians as the symbol of order at the House of Commons: a grey-haired man in a black hat and robes, often carrying the ceremonial sceptre of Canada over his shoulder.

On Tuesday, Vickers reportedly showed just how serious his role really is, the head of security for Canada’s government killing a gunman who charged into the Centre Block on Parliament Hill.

“To all in Ottawa, stay safe & strong. Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes…” Tweeted Minister Peter MacKay.

Julian Fantino, Canada’s Minister of Veterans Affairs, added his own Tweet of gratitude.

“I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.”

After the shooting, Vickers immediately contacted his family in New Brunswick to tell them he is safe — “I’m doing okay,” he said — but that hasn’t stopped them worrying about the emotional trauma that will follow, having being forced to pull the trigger for the first time.

“We’re always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him — he had to make a very serious decision today,” said Mary, Vicker’s older sister.

“He’s always a natural leader — he would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can’t stress that enough — but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.”

Raw footage of the Centre Block attack show officers and guards moving cautiously down the hall, before gunfire suddenly erupts, with dozens of shots echoing in the distance.

Various witnesses have credited Vickers with leading the security response and killing the infiltrator, a man who may have been the same cold-blooded murderer who gunned down an unarmed solider outside the national cenotaph moments before.

Anyone who thought Canada’s Sergeant-At-Arms role was an archaic novelty now understands the man holding the sceptre has a deadly serious job.

“It’s not ceremonial at all, and he has tremendous responsibility — and he wears it well,” said Mary.

In an RCMP career spanning 29 years, Vickers rose up the ranks from a constable in the Northwest Territories to serving ten years in Alberta, and then to chief superintendent in Ottawa.

After retiring from the force, he took the Sergeant-At-Arms job on Parliament Hill, and was once famously photographed escorting a protestor masquerading as a page from the House of Commons.

His niece Erin says her uncle is a calm, gentle man — but someone who handles pressure with utmost calm.

“He’s a thoughtful and considerate person — he’s halfway to a saint in my opinion,” she said.

“He’s a very capable human being.”

The troubled actor, who at one point was reportedly entrenched in heroin addiction that friends feared he had only months to live, is once again the subject of a hoax claiming that he was found dead in his Manhattan apartment.

News that Macaulay Culkin had allegedly died spread quickly on Facebook and Twitter, with users linking to a story on something called MSNBC.website.com (which is entirely separate from the real MSNBC). The report read:

Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.

Multiple unconfirmed reports say Culkin was found dead Friday afternoon in his Manhattan apartment after police responded to a wellness check requested by a family member.

At least one occupant of the Manhattan apartment confirmed the apartment belongs to Culkin but police have not confirmed the man’s identity at this time.

“The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today,” said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department.

Officer Wilson claims he felt his life was threatened on August 9

Witnesses and a friend of Brown, 18, claim he had surrendered

Brown was buried on Monday in a ceremony attended by thousands

The FBI has been handed a potentially crucial recording that allegedly contains audio of the moment that Officer Darren Wilson opened fire and killed unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.

Revealed by CNN's Don Lemon on Monday, at least ten shots are heard to ring out during the background of the recording, with a brief but significant pause between the first seven shots and the last volley of four.

The unidentified man who has given the unverified tape to authorities claims to have coincidentally recorded the fatal shots that killed Brown in broad daylight on August 9, and experts who have listened to the audio have said it could prove damning for Officer Wilson.

Scroll Down for Audio

Attorney: Lopa Blumenthal is legally representing the man who claims to have coincidentally recorded the shooting of Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9

'There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern,' said retired Chief Deputy US Marshall Matthew Fog after listening on CNN.

'It is very significant, because if you have a pause there it means somebody had time to think and then fire again.'

In the audio, the unidentified man is heard telling someone, 'You’re so pretty' then 11 gunshots can be heard to cackle in the background — seven in one volley, followed a pause and then a final burst of four.

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.

'He was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat,' said Blumenthal.

'He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.'

Lemon cautioned that 'CNN cannot independent verify the authenticity of this tape' but did say that the FBI have interviewed both Blumenthal and her client.

'We had been told that at least six shots were fired at Michael Brown. In the tape that you have, which is alleged to be of the shooting—we can't independently authorize it, as CNN, because we did not shoot it, but there were more than six shots,' Lemon said.

Grief: Dorian Johnson, who is one of the key witnesses in the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, leaves Brown's funeral at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, on Monday, 25, August

If indeed the audio is genuine it calls into question the version of events that Officer Wilson and the Ferguson police force have claimed occurred on that Saturday afternoon.

At least two autopsies performed on Michael Brown have concluded he died after being shot six times by Wilson after being pulled over by the officer, including a fatal 'kill shot' to the top of his head.

Numerous witnesses, including Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, claim that Wilson opened fire after bungling opening his squad car door, causing the teen to run before turning back to face the officer with his hands raised saying 'don't shoot'.

Johnson then alleges that Wilson continued to fire.

Ferguson police and friends of Officer Wilson contend that Brown engaged in a scuffle with Wilson when the officer pulled him and Johnson over, tried to grab his weapon and then run towards him, leaving him no choice but to fire.

Indeed in recent days reports had emerged stating that Wilson, 28, was badly beaten and left with serious facial injuries following the fatal shooting in the St Louis suburb, including an eye socket fracture.

On Tuesday, The Gateway Pundit reported that the officer had suffered an 'orbital blowout fracture'.

But CNN reported on Thursday that although the officer was taken to a hospital with a badly swollen face following the shooting on August 9, x-rays came back negative for any serious injury.

Earlier reports had claimed that the officer was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows, according to the source.

A police source told Fox: 'The Assistant (Police) Chief took him to the hospital, his face all swollen on one side. He was beaten very severely.'

The source continued: 'They ignored him [Wilson] and the officer started to get out of the car to tell them to move. They shoved him right back in, that’s when Michael Brown leans in and starts beating Officer Wilson in the head and the face.'

A police source has confirmed to MailOnline that Wilson was taken to hospital and treated for facial injuries sustained during the Brown incident but would not elaborate on the severity or nature of those injuries.

Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries.

Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record, has not been arrested or charged with any crime.

He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and is under 24-hour guard after death threats were aimed at him.

Wilson is 'traumatized, scared for his life and his family' along with being deeply concerned that a grand jury, which met for the first time on Wednesday, will make an example out of him, the source told Fox.

Earlier reports had claimed that Officer Wilson was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has come under fire after calling for the 'vigorous prosecution' of Wilson despite the fact that the officer has not yet been charged with any crime.

His deputy, Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder said: 'It's really heartbreaking to see a man elected to an office that high in our state government... come out with a statement like that, that does prejudge the case.'

St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said on Wednesday he estimated it would be the middle of October before the grand jury reached a decision on whether Officer Wilson will face charges over Michael Brown's death.

Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday ordered the Missouri National Guard to begin withdrawing from Ferguson.

Since the guard's arrival Monday, flare-ups in the small section of town that had been the center of nightly unrest have begun to subside.

About 100 people gathered Thursday evening, walking in laps near the spot where Michael Brown was shot. Some were in organized groups, such as clergy members.

More signs reflected calls by protesters to remove the prosecutor from the case.",unrelated
893,NBC's Tom Brokaw reportedly wants Brian Williams fired over fabricated Iraq helicopter story,"According the latest in a string of scoops from 9to5Mac, battery life has been a pressing concern for Apple throughout the development of the Apple Watch. And for the first time, ""sources familiar with the Watch's development"" have provided some early figures on what consumers can expect when the device ships sometime this year. In short, Apple Watch will exhibit similar longevity to what we've seen from many Android Wear devices on the market today.

Apple was originally shooting to eke out an entire day of battery life from Apple Watch. Obviously that's not all active use; in fact, the company is said to be shooting for 2.5 to 4 hours of active application use with the screen turned on. That'll vary depending on how heavily you use it, of course. But since the wearable's display will often be turned off throughout the day — and because the iPhone handles a lot of computing tasks — Apple is apparently hopeful that the watch can make it from morning until you place it back on the wireless charger at night. 19 hours of combined active and passive use seems to be the bar as of right now.

THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE TO EXTEND A SMARTWATCH'S BATTERY LIFE

This isn't unlike what you'd get from the current field of Android smartwatches; use them constantly and they won't last a day. But that changes with more average use. Notably, the Pebble smartwatch continues to blow away the field in terms of battery life, but it's a very different device when compared against a Moto 360 or the Apple Watch. In standby and low-power modes, 9to5Mac's sources say Apple Watch can last through two or three days. And if for some reason you want to use it strictly as a timepiece and leave the screen on at all times, it'll die out after three or so hours. Using it as a workout companion? Your gym routine shouldn't last more than four hours.

Apple is reportedly testing Apple Watch's battery life aggressively — and in large numbers. 9to5Mac claims the company has distributed over 3,000 units as the development process continues. And while the iPhone is a critical companion to Apple Watch, the device itself may be more powerful than some expected. 9to5Mac says the CPU inside is more or less equally as powerful as the A5 chip that powered the iPhone 4S and iPad 2, and remains in the current-generation iPod touch. Considering the tiny form factor, we're expecting the same fluidity and responsiveness that have become hallmarks of iOS. But as for the battery, Apple can only do so much. The simple fact is that battery technology doesn't evolve at nearly the same rate as the smartphones in our pockets and wearables on our wrists. The company will undoubtedly keep pushing for improvements as Apple Watch's launch nears; it's expected to ship beginning in March.",unrelated

895,"UNIVERSITY DROPS TERM ‘FRESHMAN,’ REPLACES IT WITH ‘FIRST-YEAR’","Dramatic footage from an Afghanistan battlefield shows the moment a U.S. Marine survived a bullet to his head, thanks to his kevlar helmet.

According to Sam Arnold, who posted the video on YouTube, the footage was recorded on a helmet camera during a “joint helicopter raid” in the Now Zad district of Helmand Province in 2013.

At the start of the incredible three-minute video, gunfire is heard in the background, and three Marines decide to try to find out where the shots came from. They pass through a tunnel stocked with barrels and wood, and peek through a doorway on the south side of the compound. Then, a bullet strikes one of the Marine’s helmets, knocking his head back. The three marines turn around and run back to their original position.

“Dude, you got shot,” says the Marine who caught the dramatic event on camera. “I saw it hit your kevlar.”

“I did get shot,” the other Marine replies. He seems remarkably calm, but a little dazed. His only complaint is that his ears are ringing.

“Lucky son of a b—h,” says the one with the camera.

The three Marines join other members of their unit and head off to track down the “Taliban sniper” before the video ends. The footage was uploaded two weeks ago and has been viewed more than 610,000 times.",unrelated
896,The Story Of The High School Trader Who Made $72 Million Is A Rumor Spun Out Of Control,"DC Toy Collector is the “highest paid performer” on YouTube making nearly $5 million last year unboxing Disney toys. However, little has been known about the woman-behind-the-hands of the popular YouTube channel. In fact, her face is never shown in the video, only her voice, toys and hands. However, a recent report reveals the true identity of the YouTube hit and the identity is somewhat shocking. A former Brazilian porn star is behind the wholesome Disney videos and it is noted that during the early years of “Disney Collector,” the woman was filming both Disney unboxing videos and porn in the same Florida home.

The Daily Mail reports that Brazilian Daiane DeJeus, also known as Sandy Summers in the porn industry, is the woman behind the hit Disney Collector Youtube videos. Reporters tracked down information on DeJeus that aligns with public records information regarding the widely popular DC Toy Collector YouTube channel. After tracking down DeJeus, the reporters spoke with family and friends who confirmed that Daiane was behind the million dollar videos.

DeJeus has went to unfathomable measures to ensure her identity remained secret and for good reason. The target market of the YouTube channel, which caters to Disney lovers such as children and families, may not remain viewers if they knew the owner’s secret. DeJeus was not only a Disney fanatic, but also a porn star. Going by the name Sandy Summers, Dejeus filmed numerous x-rated videos for the adult film industry in the same home that she filmed some of her early DC Toy Collector features.

Family and friends have identified DeJeus as the mystery unboxer and note that certain physical features on the woman’s hands and arms can be seen in many of the YouTube videos.

“They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.”

Aside from the physical similarities, former neighbors say DeJeus has an unmistakable voice and say that many people on the street knew what she was up to.

‘That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere. Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.”

Would you have ever imagined that the popular DC Toy Collector videos were being filmed in the same house as adult films by a porn star?

897,Resetting iOS 8 Preferences May Wipe iCloud Files,"There may be yet another bug in iOS 8, Apple's latest version of its mobile operating system for iPhone and iPad. This time, some users are reporting that anybody trying to reset the settings on their iPhone could accidentally delete all of their documents saved in iCloud, Apple's online backup service.

MacRumors reports that multiple users of its forums have reported an issue when attempting to reset all settings on their iPhone. Apple informs you as you reset your phone settings that ""no data or media will be deleted,"" but people are claiming that the reset wipes all of their iCloud Drive documents.

The existence of the bug is not yet confirmed. We asked Apple for comment but have not yet heard back.

iCloud Drive is Apple's online file storage solution for documents. According to the official Apple site, iCloud Drive can be used to ""safely store all your presentations, spreadsheets, PDFs, images and any other kind of document in iCloud."" It competes with DropBox and other cloud storage apps.

Forum posts claim that after they complained that a settings reset deleted their files as well, Apple told them the company is waiting on engineers to fix the issue. Another reported that his account was placed in troubleshooting mode as Apple investigated.
One poster on the MacRumors forums has this to say about the problem:

"" Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud. I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox. They seem gone forever.""

The launch of iOS 8 has been a PR nightmare for Apple. One update managed to stop iPhone 6 users from making calls, and Apple was forced to pull the update and quickly work on a fix.",discuss
898,Magic mushrooms found at Buckingham Palace,"LONDON — The world knows him as “Jihadi John,” the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online.

But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolize.

“I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,” said one of Emwazi’s close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. “He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him.”

[View: The atrocities of the Islamic State]

A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held.

“There was an extremely strong resemblance,” Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said after watching one of the videos. “This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.”

Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John. James B. Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September — only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley — that officials believed they had succeeded.

Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foley’s killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded.

[Read: The tactics of Islamic State beheadings]

In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm.

A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: “Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues.” ISIL is another name for the Islamic State.

U.S. officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazi’s family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice.

The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said.

He was raised in a middle-class neighborhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich.

The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalize after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster.

Emwazi and two friends — a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib — never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. It’s unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported.

Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britain’s domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post.

Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda.

The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam.

Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. “Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,” Qureshi said.

Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalize his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait.

In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again — this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so.

“I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,” he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now “I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait.”

Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had “heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!!”

In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice.

“This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation,” Qureshi said. In the end, he felt “actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions.”

Close friends of Emwazi’s also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. It’s unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how.

One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone.

“He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere,” one of the friends said. “He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out.”

Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. It’s unclear what he told them about his activities there.

A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility “the box.” Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed “George.” A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages.

Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. “He was the most deliberate,” a former hostage said.

Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic State’s de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State.

About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi.

“I was wondering if you could send me your number,” he wrote. “Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up.”

There was no response.

900,Pull the other Un! North Korean dictator has not been seen for weeks because he 'pulled tendon while doing drill with his generals',"Reasons cited for his mysterious disappearance range from ill health through an addiction to cheese to him being placed under house arrest.
Now the latest explanation for Kim Jong Un's conspicuous absence is that he has simply injured his leg.  
A source with access to the secretive North's leadership today insisted the leader is in firm control of his government, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's health and grip on power.
North Korea's state media, which usually chronicles Kim's whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on September 3. 
The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.
He IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship has said, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's grip on power after claims he had been placed under house arrest

He IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship has said, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's grip on power after claims he had been placed under house arrest
'He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. 
'They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,' the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
'He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. 
He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,' the source said.

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.
Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified.
'Kim Jong Un is in total control,' said the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing.

Friday is the 69th anniversary of the founding of North Korea's Workers' Party, an event Kim has marked in the past two years with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred.
If Kim does not turn up, it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle, experts said.
'The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,' said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. 
North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble.
It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.

In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.
He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.
Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from 'discomfort'.
Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.
Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang.
The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumours of a coup were 'rubbish'.
'It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,' said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a programme for North Koreans in Southeast Asia.
North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye.
Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.
However, Kim's name has not disappeared from state propaganda.
Thursday's edition of the Workers' Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked 'the Marshal' for his support during the competition.
Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped.
'Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing,' he said.",discuss

Libyan terrorists have posted pictures of themselves online posing with some of the aeroplanes taken from Tripoli airport after fighters seized it last month.

Soldiers from the group Libyan Dawn can be seen climbing on to the wings of commercial jets while smiling and waving for the camera.

U.S. officials fear that these aeroplanes could now be used to carry out 9/11-style attacks in the region on the anniversary of the tragedy this month.

A total of 11 commercial jets from state-owned carriers Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways went missing in August after militants from the so-called 'masked men brigade' overran the airport.

Tripoli airport was left as little more than a smouldering ruin after rebels seized control of it in August

Officials have been warning for some time about the deteriorating situation in Libya, which was controlled by dictator Muammar Gaddaffi until he was killed in October 2011.

'There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,' one official told the Washington Free-Beacon. 'We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.'

September 11 not only marks the anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center but it will also be the second anniversary of the raid of the U.S. Ambassador's compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Four Americans were killed in the attack, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

Ansar al-Shariah, the group Washington holds responsible for the attack, have also seized parts of the Libyan capital and are known to work with terrorists from ISIS.

However they are not thought to be working with fighters from Libyan Dawn, as they are an Al-Qaeda affiliated group.

Libyan Dawn, an Al-Qaeda affiliated group, are now in control of part of Tripoli, as are Ansar al-Shariah, the group held responsible for the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Libya

Tripoli International Airport was being run by two anti-Islamist militias and had been closed since mid-July when it was taken over at the end of August by the group Libyan Dawn.

Pictures show the aftermath of the firefight, with planes completely or partially blasted and several littered with bullet holes.

Tripoli is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gaddaffi left power. The militias, many of which originate from rebel forces that fought Gaddaffi, became powerful players in post-war Libya, filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army.

Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order, but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped-for transition to democracy.

On Sunday, the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital.

Ansar al-Sharia has ties to the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), the Syrian group which today released the filmed beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff - the second recorded execution of a U.S. hostage by the group.

Fears: Nearly a dozen commercial planes are missing in Libya after a radical Islamic group overtook the international airport in the capital of Tripoli late last month.

Aftermath: Tripoli International Airport was overtaken by the group Libyan Dawn last month and now 11 aircraft for Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways are missing

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui told Al Jazeera television after the airport attack that the planes had been taken by another Islamic group, the Masked Men Brigade.

Mekkaoui said there is 'credible intelligence' that the Masked Men Brigade 'is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the Maghreb state' on the 9/11 anniversary.

Sebastian Gorka, a counterterrorism expert, told the Free-Beacon that the planes could be used in two ways to strike North Africa or even as far as the oil fields of Saudi Arabia.

'The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,' Gorka, the Maj Gen Charles Horner chair at the Marine Corps University, said.

'The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,' he added.

U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the eleven planes' disappearance, but are reportedly working to track them down.

Since the overthrow of previous dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya has descended into turmoil and officials fear it may become another safe haven for terrorists, like Syria.

902,Wife and son of Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 'detained at Lebanon border',"update

An Iraqi official today denied that a woman detained in Lebanon yesterday is the wife of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as confusion continues to reign over the identity of a woman and child captured by the Lebanese army near the border with Syria, AP reported.

Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maan Ibrahim told AP that the woman in question was indeed called Saja al-Dumani, as reported yesterday. However, Ibrahim said she is not al-Baghdadi’s wife, as Lebanese officials had claimed. Instead, she is the sister of Omar Abdul Hamid al-Dumani, an Iraqi terror suspect being held by authorities in the country, Ibrahim said.

Although their identities have not officially been made public, Reuters is reporting that the woman in question is an Iraqi named Saja al-Dulaimi, citing a security official and a senior political source. She is one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail as part of a prisoner swap for 13 nuns held by al-Qaeda–linked Syrian militants in March.

The al-Safir newspaper said that Baghdadi’s wife was currently being interrogated by Lebanon’s Defense Ministry, the BBC reported.

There have been conflicting reports as to whether the child is Baghdadi’s daughter or son. The security official cited by Reuters said it is his daughter, and that DNA tests have been carried out to confirm she is Baghdadi’s child. However, the BBC is reporting that the child is his son.

It is also unclear when the pair were detained by Lebanese authorities, with Reuters saying it occurred “in recent days,” while a source told AFP they were taken near Arsal 10 days ago.

Speaking to CNN, terror expert and Director at the Asia Pacific Foundation Sajjan M. Cohel said, “It’s certainly a new dynamic because we’ve never seen anybody connected so close to al-Baghdadi being detained.”

However, Cohel questioned what the pair were doing in Lebanon: “Is he estranged from them? Has he fallen out with them? Were they escaping from him?”

Very little is known about al-Baghdadi. He has not been seen in public since June, and last month ISIS denied reports that he had been injured or killed by an air strike by U.S.–lead forces near Mosul.",discuss
903,Eyewitness Says Viral Video of Homeless Man Was Staged,"Militants from Islamic State (Isis) claimed to have killed an American journalist long held captive in Syria in retaliation for ongoing US airstrikes against its forces in Iraq.

A propaganda video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man dressed in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Wright Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012.

The masked executioner spoke in English, with what sounded like a British accent, and said that the slaying came in response to the airstrikes ordered by President Barack Obama against Isis 12 days ago.

Isis, whose chief spokesman came under State Department sanctions on Monday, warned of further revenge – including on another man purported to be a captured US journalist, Steven Sotloff – and in the video, the victim was made to read a statement blaming the US for his own murder.

Foley has been missing in Syria since November 2012, where he went to report on the bloody struggle to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. He was initially thought to have been captured by forces loyal to the Assad regime.

A Facebook message from a support group, Free James Foley, urged patience “until we all have more information,” and asked that readers “keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

YouTube took down the gruesome video, but not before it sparked a debate on social media about the ethics of sharing it, adding a metatextual debate to a depiction of a man’s violent death.

Foley, 40, a former Stars and Stripes reporter, was captured in November 2012 near the Syrian town of Taftanaz. It was not his first detention while reporting: in 2011, he was taken while reporting on the uprising against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi’s forces ultimately released him after six weeks in captivity.

A friend of Foley’s and his fellow captive in Libya, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote in a 2013 essay that captivity was “the state most violently opposite his nature.” Gillis described Foley as gentle, friendly, courageous and impatient with “anything that slows his forward momentum.”

In a January 2013 interview with local television news near her Rochester, New Hampshire home, Foley’s mother Diane said her son was “passionate about covering the story in Syria, passionate about the people there.”

Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said US intelligence was working to determine the authenticity of the video.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said in a statement.

Messages left with the Foley family were not returned.

A day after Obama declared that Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US warplanes had broken Isis’ hold on the critical Mosul Dam, US Central Command announced two strikes near it on Monday, to “further expand control of the area.” One strike was said to have destroyed an Isis checkpoint while the other was “not successful.”

Obama has offered no timeframe for the length of his campaign against Isis. The US military has bombed over 90 targets attributed to Isis, including vehicle convoys, mobile artillery and fixed positions, since 8 August. Most of the strikes have come in the past few days, near the dam. The other strikes have occurred either to blunt an Isis advance on the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil or to lift an Isis siege on Mount Sinjar, where it chased thousands of Iraqi Yazidis whom it threatened to kill unless they converted to Islam. The US considers the siege broken.",unrelated

Gill Rosenberg's kidnapping was reported by The Jerusalem Post as well as ynetnews.com, the English-language edition of Ynet, Israel's largest and most popular news website.

""The reports began surfacing on jihadi and Palestinian social media and forums, and claim Rosenberg was taken while fighting with the Peshmerga forces in Kobani, Syria,"" ynetnews.com said on its site.

The Post said that in an interview with Israel Radio in early November, Rosenberg said she had decided to join the fighters for humanitarian and ideological reasons and “because they are our brothers” who are fighting Islamic State.

Friends of Rosenberg posted messsages on her Facebook page shortly after the news of her possible kidnapping broke.

""Hope this is wrong and you come back safely. Gila bat Avraham,"" Ed-Malki Dvir wrote.

And Chris Levy posted: ""I hope this isn't true but if it is then I am praying for you and your other captured hevals in your darkest hours."" Heval means friend in Kurdish.

Haaretz.com, the online edition of Israel's oldest daily newspaper, said ""the pro-Islamic State blog Samoach al-Islam reported that several female fighters who fought alongside the Kurds have been captured, among them Gill Rosenberg.

""According to the report, prior to their capture, Islamic State fighters made three suicide bombing attacks against Kurdish outposts, killing some and capturing many others.""

Haaretz says, Samoach al-Islam is considered to be one of the media arms of ISIS.

Dylan Thomas, 21, was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach

Doctors at Bali International Medical Centre initially thought he had just been bitten by a small insect and gave him an antihistamine. When it started to blister the next day, he knew some was wrong

So imagine his surprise when doctors discovered a tropical spider burrowing just below his skin a day later.

Mr Thomas, who recently returned to his Bunbury home in Western Australia, was initially given an antihistamine cream to treat the mark.

But the next morning when he found it had started to blister, Mr Thomas went to see a dermatologist.

Doctors retrieved the spider from his abdomen, which had burrowed its way through a small scar from a previous operation where he had his appendix removed

The 21-year-old has since returned to his Bunbury home in WA but is yet to find out what kind of spider it was

Doctors retrieved the spider from his abdomen, which had burrowed its way through a small scar from a previous operation where he had his appendix removed.

'It was a bit bigger than the size of a match head,' Mr Thomas told the newspaper.

'It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated. It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days.'

908,Surreal Photos of Fisherman’s Jaw-Dropping Catch Will Likely Have People Wondering If It’s Real,"The North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has not been seen in public for more than a month, leading to rumors his sister has taken over while the Supreme Leader fights an illness or sits under house arrest.

Where is Kim Jong Un?

The saber-rattling North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month, spurring rumors he is ill and leading to speculation over who — if anyone — has filled the power vacuum in Pyongyang.

But there's one atom bomb of a theory being mentioned by Korea watchers that's quickly gaining currency.

Analysts believe 27-year-old Kim Yo Jong, the seventh and youngest of Kim Jong Il's children with four women, has risen rapidly within the regime and may be secretly running the Hermit Kingdom — for now.

Little Kim reportedly went to the same Swiss boarding school with Kim Jong Un and has held positions within the North Korean government since her father was in power.

""If in fact she is running the country — as someone in their early- to mid-20s — to me that is quite alarming,"" Center for Strategic and International Studies analyst Victor Cha told CNN. ""It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.""

State TV showed Kim Jong Un uncharacteristically walking with a noticeable limp in July at the 20th anniversary memorial commemorating the death of his grandfather, the nation's founder.

After the Supreme Leader's recent vanishing act, health theories have abounded. Kim is ill with everything from gout and a cheese addiction to ankle problems and diabetes. State media called what ails Kim ""discomfort"" in a Sept. 26 report.

He may even be under house arrest, according to Remco Breuker, professor of Korean studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

""We're not sure where he is, or what's happening,"" Breuker told the ABC News. ""We don't know whether he's in the hospital or whether he's been put under house arrest.""

Kim Jong Un, whose pal Dennis Rodman said is 31, saw his waistline balloon since he ascended to power in late 2011, analysts note.

Sis Kim Yo Jong is a senior official in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. But her role might have expanded dramatically if Kim Jong Un is incapacitated.

""She is one of the only people in (North Korea) that we know has unfettered direct access to KJU. At the present time I would not be surprised if she is sole gatekeeper,"" North Korea Leadership Watch blog's Michael Madden told NBC News.

Korea watchers point to Friday's anniversary of the founding of the Ruling Workers Party. If Kim Jong Un doesn't show, expect speculation to reach fever pitch.

909,Video: Islamic State Claims to Have Captured US Weapons Airdrop Near Kobane,"In a new video posted online, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claims it has captured weapons and ammunition dropped by the U.S. military that was intended for Kurdish forces defending an embattled Syrian city near the Turkish border.

The airdrops Sunday were the first of their kind and followed weeks of U.S. and coalition airstrikes in and near Kobani.

In the video, ISIS claims some of the weapons and ammunition was air-dropped by mistake on its positions in Kobani.



A senior administration official told CBS News on Sunday that the majority - but not necessarily all - of the bundles dropped by U.S. forces appeared to ‎make it to their intended targets.

""We are still assessing the completion of the mission but every indication that we have is that the vast majority of those bundles were successfully delivered to Kurdish forces,"" the official said. ""We're still working through a complete assessment right now.‎""

Because the drops were made overnight, the Pentagon could not say with 100 certainty that they reached their intended destinations.

Idris Nassan, a senior Kurdish official from Kobani who is now in the Turkish town of Mursitpinar, confirmed the Kurdish fighters received the airdrop and asked for more weapons.

""We are not in need of fighters. We are able to defeat the terrorists of ISIS if we have weaponry - enough weaponry and enough ammunition,"" he told The Associated Press.

Kurdish fighters tweeted messages of appreciation along with photos that apparently show that some of the air-dropped cargo - including M-16 guns and medical supplies - did reach its intended recipients.",discuss

ISIS sympathisers took to social media to identify the 'cub fighter' by his alleged nom de guerre Abu Ubaidah, adding that both he and his father were killed during clashes in Syria in recent weeks, but not specifying exactly where they died or who they had been fighting against.

Several images, which have not been independently verified, emerged on social media this week after a video reporting the deaths of the boy and his father was uploaded to YouTube in September.

The original video - distributed by the pro-Isis media group Al-A'amaq - is understood to have since been removed, but a number of photographs of the boy have since been widely shared by ISIS militants and their sympathisers on social media.

One image shows the boy standing inside a house, grinning as he struggles to hold an assault rifle so large that it threatens to topple him over.

Another picture shows him smiling sweetly while wearing an ammunition vest as he stands next to a van that has been converted into an armoured vehicle with a large plank of wood and bull bars.

Other images show him posing with a man understood to be his father, who militants named as 'Baghdadi'. In those images the boy identified as Abu Ubaidah is seen calmly holding another large rifle while surrounded by bearded men wearing military clothing.

Last week a 24-year-old Muslim convert admitted taking her infant son to live among Islamic State terrorists in the Syrian city of Raqqa because she believes he will lead a 'better life' under their brutal regime.

Asiya Ummi Abdullah denied that children are unhappy living under the oppressive rule of ISIS' religious fanatics and explained that she felt her three-year-old son's spiritual well-being was better served in the group's de facto capital, where public crucifixions and beheadings are commonplace.

Ummi Abduallah - who had lived in Turkey since her teens but was born in Kyrgyzstan - said moving to the militant stronghold in Syria was in part to shield the young boy from the sex, crime, drugs and alcohol she sees as rampant in her home town Istanbul.

'Who says children here are unhappy?... He will know God and live under his rules,' she said.

Dramatic footage has emerged from inside Kobane showing brave Kurdish fighters battling against militants from the Islamic State.

The clip, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, shows resistance forces from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) firing assault rifles and machine guns mounted on the back of a car at militants hiding behind buildings in the Kobane suburbs.

The terrorists launched a renewed assault on Kobane last night, killing dozens of Kurds who have resisted ISIS' advances into the city's suburbs over the last three weeks.

Islamic State militants are now in control of one third of the besieged Syrian city of Kobane despite three days of American airstrikes, a group monitoring violence in the country said today.

This morning the chilling sight of the group's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes.

While the airstrikes appear to have slowed the militants advance in some areas of the city, ISIS fighters appear to be creeping ever closer to the centre of Kobane, where thousands of civilians unable or unwilling to flee their homes face rape and massacre.

News of ISIS' gains came as the Pentagon admitted airstrikes alone will not be enough to prevent the fall of Kobane, raising serious questions over the U.S.'s wider campaign against the terror group.

Dramatic: The escalation in Kobane has seen the U.S. and Arab coalition carry out the most sustained period of bombing raids since their campaign to destroy the Islamic State in northern Syria started two weeks ago

Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said airstrikes are 'not going to be enough to save that city', amid growing concern that without Western ground troops being sent into Syria, the defeat of ISIS will prove a near impossible task.

Heavily outgunned Kurdish defenders said Islamic State militants had pushed into two districts of Kobane - a mainly Kurdish border city with 40,000 residents - by late last night.

There’s several pieces of the news, with some indicating that the dictator Jong-Un may no longer be in control of the country.

Jang Jin-sung, formerly a key member of Kim Jong-il’s propaganda machine, said recently that a powerful group of officials that once reported only to Jong-il have stopped taking orders from Jong-Un and now effectively run the country.

The group is called the Organization and Guidance Department, and some of them want to keep the status quo while others want to open up the market.

“On one hand, it’s people who want to maintain a regime monopoly,” Jang told VICE News through a translator.

“On the other hand, it’s not like people are fighting against the regime, but in a policy sense they want to take advantage to get influence. It’s not actually consciously civil war, but there are these two incompatible forces at play.”

The insight comes as Seoul-based think tank North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity says that Kim Yo Jong may be leading the country instead of her brother.

The NKIS says that Jong-Un is getting medical treatment for an unspecified illness, and that the extended treatment was actually decided upon at a high-level meeting in early September that was held at Yo Jong’s suggestion.

She’s now charged with handling important government decisions in his absence, according to the Diplomat, citing the report.

“All the important matters related to government administration should be reported to Kim Yo-jong, so that Kim Jong-un can concentrate on getting better,” the people at the meeting decided.

Yo Jong is the daughter of Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, and his wife Kim Yong-hui, and was first spotted in public in September 2010. She was officially mentioned for the first time on March 9, 2014, being identified as a “senior official” in the government.

Then again, perhaps Yo Kong is not in total control, according to Kim Heung-gwang, the head of NKIS.

“Some say Hwang Byong-so, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,” he said.

The possible leadership change comes amid reports of an attempted coup.

(RNS) When Pope Francis recently sought to comfort a distraught boy whose dog had died, the pontiff took the sort of pastoral approach he is famous for — telling the youngster not to worry, that he would one day see his pet in heaven.

“Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures,” Francis said reassuringly.

 This image is available for Web and print publication. For questions, contact Sally Morrow.

It was a sparkling moment on a rainy November day, and the setting in St. Peter’s Square only burnished Francis’ reputation as a kindly “people’s pope.” The story naturally lit up social media, became instant promotional material for vegetarians and animal rights groups, and on Friday even made it to the front page of The New York Times.

There’s only one problem: apparently none of it ever happened.

Yes, a version of that quotation was uttered by a pope, but it was said decades ago by Paul VI, who died in 1978. There is no evidence that Francis repeated the words during his public audience on Nov. 26, as has been widely reported, nor was there was a boy mourning his dead dog.

So how could such a fable so quickly become taken as fact?

Part of the answer may be the topic of the pope’s talk to the crowd that day, which centered on the End Times and the transformation of all creation into a “new heaven” and a “new earth.” Citing St. Paul in the New Testament, Francis said that is not “the annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us, but the bringing of all things into the fullness of being.”

The trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an Italian news report that extended Francis’ discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to heaven.

“One day we will see our pets in the eternity of Christ,” the report quoted Paul VI as telling a disconsolate boy years ago.

The story was titled, somewhat misleadingly: “Paradise for animals? The Pope doesn’t rule it out.” It wasn’t clear which pope the writer meant, however.

The next day, Nov. 27, a story in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera by veteran Vaticanista Gian Guido Vecchi pushed the headline further: “The Pope and pets: “Paradise is open to all creatures.”

Vecchi faithfully recounted the pope’s talk about a new creation, and also cited Paul VI’s remark.

But the headline put those words in Francis’ mouth, and that became the story.

The Italian version of the Huffington Post picked it up next and ran an article quoting Francis as saying “We will go to heaven with the animals” and contending that the pope was quoting St. Paul – not Pope Paul – as making that statement to console a boy who lost his dog. (That story, by the way, is nowhere in the Bible.)

The urban legend became unstoppable a week later when it was translated into English and picked up by the British press, which cited St. Paul as saying that “One day we will see our animals again in (the) eternity of Christ,” while it has Francis adding the phrase: “Paradise is open to all God’s creatures.”

Fueling the meme was the fact that Francis was photographed accepting a gift of two donkeys from a company promoting the use of donkey milk for infants allergic to cow’s milk – and Francis said his own mother gave him donkey’s milk as a baby.

Social media and other media outlets then picked up the story, further conflating the statements and the chronology. It became a hot mess of a story that was also sparking another theological debate by a pope who was known for prompting controversy.

The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets, paradise, and Pope Francis.

The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets, paradise, and Pope Francis.
When The New York Times went with the story, along with input from ethicists and theologians, it became gospel truth.

Television programs discussed the pope’s theological breakthrough, news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals, and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the afterlife. At America magazine, the Rev. James Martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of Francis’ statements and what level of authority they may have. It was all very interesting and illuminating, but based on a misunderstanding.

A number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train wreck:

The story had so much going for it: Francis took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and sisters.
Pope Francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment, and almost since the day he was elected in 2013 he has stressed the Christian duty to care for creation.
Francis also blessed a blind man’s guide dog shortly after he was elected, an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for animals.
Moreover, the media and the public are so primed for Francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out; it fit with the pattern.
In most accounts, Francis’ comments were also set against statements by his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who insisted that animals did not have souls. That apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative Benedict against the ostensibly liberal Francis.

That may be true in some areas, but probably not when it comes to animals.

Adding insult to injury, the Times article cited St. John Paul II as saying in 1990 that animals have souls and are “as near to God as men are.” But that, too, was a misquote, as media critic Dawn Eden explained at the website GetReligion.

On the other hand, there should have been warnings signs: Francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people, and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go hungry.

In addition, the pope’s huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of myth-making: news reports last year said that Francis was sneaking out of the Vatican at night to feed the homeless around Rome.

The pope personally debunked that rumor in an interview last March, saying the idea “has never crossed my mind” and that “depicting the pope to be a sort of superman, a type of star, seems offensive to me.”

Maybe he’ll have to give another interview to deflate this latest story, and to offer his real thoughts on pets and paradise.

918,Judd Nelson Death Hoax: FOX News Impersonator Claims Actor Found Dead In Los Angeles Condo,"Apple may be planning to hold a special event during the month of February, according to French Apple-focused website iGen [Google Translate] (via iDownloadBlog). The site's sources, which are often reliable, suggest that the event might take place during the last week of February, potentially on Tuesday, February 24.

The event may see Apple once again showcasing the Apple Watch, which is set to debut in April, and it may also see the launch of the 12-inch MacBook Air. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently predicted that the upcoming notebook will debut in March, which is in line with a late-February unveiling.

Rendering of the 12-inch MacBook Air by Martin Hajek
Apple's 12-inch MacBook Air is rumored to feature a new ultrathin design that does away with fans and introduces a revamped trackpad. It may include a low-power Core-M processor and it may be the first device to take advantage of the new reversible USB Type-C connector, which is much smaller and allows a USB cable to be inserted into a notebook in any orientation.

Apple may also use the event to unveil additional details on the Apple Watch, such as pricing and battery life. An event showing off the Apple Watch could explain why Apple has been asking some developers to have their apps ready to launch in the App Store in mid-February, as we reported last week. It's possible that Apple will use apps from these developers to demonstrate additional capabilities of the watch.

Though rumored, a February event is by no means confirmed at this point, and it is unclear what else Apple might cover in addition to the Apple Watch and the 12-inch MacBook Air.

Update 12:23 PM: Sources speaking to 9to5Mac have indicated Apple will not be holding a late February media event.

919,"Six months after abducting Nigerian schoolgirls, Boko Haram reportedly wants to free them","Young North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s health is just fine, his government said Thursday evening, so his sister is probably not running the country. It was said Kim Yo Jong had taken over while her brother underwent medical treatment, but So Se Pyong, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told Reuters Kim was not in bad health.

The ambassador sat down for an interview where he discussed a variety of matters, including North Korea's nuclear program, possibly negotiations to free three detained Americans and, of course, Kim’s health.

It has been rumored Kim, 31, might have had ankle surgery, but So said that is incorrect. The story emerged after Kim did not appear at the Supreme People's Assembly last month and reports said he suffered from ""discomfort.” He was also seen walking with a limp in July. ""That is rumors, fabricated rumors,"" So said about Kim's alleged ailment.

Questions about Kim’s health rose after an article from the Diplomat, a magazine based in Tokyo, claimed his sister was making important government decisions while Kim was being treated at Bonghwa Clinic in North Korea's capital Pyongyang.

""Some say Hwang Byong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo Jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,"" Kim Heung Gwang, the head of North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, reportedly said.

Even if So denies any health problems, Kim has not been seen by his people since Sept. 3. The leader also gained a significant amount of weight, which could contribute to ailments like gout, diabetes or high blood pressure, sources told the Associated Press. If he were suffering from gout, his cheese eating and smoking would worsen the condition.

“The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,” Woody said.

921,US hostage Luke Somers dies after rescue bid,"SANA, Yemen — An American journalist held for more than a year by Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen was killed during a rescue attempt by United States commandos late Friday, a senior United States official said.

Early reports of the overnight raid were sketchy. The official said that the journalist, Luke Somers, 33, was apparently shot by his captors as the raid unfolded and was badly wounded when the commandos reached him. By the time Mr. Somers was flown to a United States naval ship in the region, he had died from his injuries, the official said Saturday.

There was no immediate comment from the Obama administration about the raid, which took place in the southern Yemeni province of Shabwa. When asked about the operation at a security conference in Bahrain, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, the head of United States Central Command, declined to comment.

Mr. Somers’ sister, Lucy Somers, told The Associated Press on Saturday that she had been notified by the FBI of her brother’s death. “We ask that all of Luke’s family members be allowed to mourn in peace,” she said.

Mr. Somers, a freelance journalist, was abducted in the Yemeni capital, Sana, in September 2013. Last month, United States commandos and Yemeni counterterrorism troops made an unsuccessful attempt to rescue him in a remote Yemeni province.

On Wednesday, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemeni extremist group that was holding Mr. Somers, threatened to kill him by the end of the week if its demands were not met.

922,That Boko Haram Ceasefire in Nigeria Isn’t A Ceasefire,"Boko Haram has reportedly agreed to a cease-fire with the Nigerian military as well as the release of hundreds of schoolgirls who were abducted by the terrorist group earlier this year, officials said Friday. The jihadist militia has not yet made a public statement about the decision, which could confirm the arrangement, according to the BBC.

""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told the BBC. ""I am cautiously optimistic."" The announcement of the release and cease-fire comes after a month of negotiations between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram, which has killed more than 2,000 civilians in 2014 alone.

The little-known al Qaeda offshoot gained national attention in April when they abducted some 300 schoolgirls from a school in Chibok, northern Nigeria, to be sold as slaves. The abduction sparked international outrage and the social media campaign #BringBackOurGirls that enlisted the likes of U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and countless celebrities. Human rights organizations are watching the ongoing deals closely for any developments.

In August, Boko Haram declared an “Islamic state” in northeastern Nigeria, the Washington Post reported. Authorities believe the group is hiding the girls somewhere in that area. Jennifer Cook, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the longer the girls stay in captivity, the harder it would be to bring them home.

“With hostage situations with this many people, to bring one set back without endangering another set is very difficult,” Cooke told Time. “In some cases, there’s a pretty good idea of where they are, but extricating them from a group of armed criminals who have so little respect for life is a difficult negotiation process. And the longer they’re there, the greater likelihood they become dispersed, and the more difficult they are to track down.”

It's unclear how the girls have been treated during their captivity, raising questions about their health. “These girls are being held under absolutely horrific circumstances, subjected to sexual violence and rape, forced into servitude,” Cooke said. “There are reports that some have become pregnant.”",discuss

The Watch’s ability to survive in water isn’t surprising, since it’s designed as a workout accessory in addition to something people wear around town.

Apple hasn’t claimed that it’s fully waterproof, which may make it less appealing to swimmers, divers and other people who want their timepieces to survive an extended dip in the water. There’s also the matter of the Watch’s battery life: Cook said that he has to take it off every night to charge.

925,Pure Evil: Islamic State Beheads American Journalist James Wright Foley,"DC Toy Collector is the “highest paid performer” on YouTube making nearly $5 million last year unboxing Disney toys. However, little has been known about the woman-behind-the-hands of the popular YouTube channel. In fact, her face is never shown in the video, only her voice, toys and hands. However, a recent report reveals the true identity of the YouTube hit and the identity is somewhat shocking. A former Brazilian porn star is behind the wholesome Disney videos and it is noted that during the early years of “Disney Collector,” the woman was filming both Disney unboxing videos and porn in the same Florida home.

The Daily Mail reports that Brazilian Daiane DeJeus, also known as Sandy Summers in the porn industry, is the woman behind the hit Disney Collector Youtube videos. Reporters tracked down information on DeJeus that aligns with public records information regarding the widely popular DC Toy Collector YouTube channel. After tracking down DeJeus, the reporters spoke with family and friends who confirmed that Daiane was behind the million dollar videos.

DeJeus has went to unfathomable measures to ensure her identity remained secret and for good reason. The target market of the YouTube channel, which caters to Disney lovers such as children and families, may not remain viewers if they knew the owner’s secret. DeJeus was not only a Disney fanatic, but also a porn star. Going by the name Sandy Summers, Dejeus filmed numerous x-rated videos for the adult film industry in the same home that she filmed some of her early DC Toy Collector features.

Family and friends have identified DeJeus as the mystery unboxer and note that certain physical features on the woman’s hands and arms can be seen in many of the YouTube videos.

“They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.”

Aside from the physical similarities, former neighbors say DeJeus has an unmistakable voice and say that many people on the street knew what she was up to.

‘That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere. Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.”

Would you have ever imagined that the popular DC Toy Collector videos were being filmed in the same house as adult films by a porn star?

926,British rapper a suspect in ISIS beheading,"A British rapper whose father is awaiting trial in Manhattan for a pair of US embassy bombings is a leading suspect in the barbaric beheading of American journalist James Foley, it was revealed on Friday.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary — who recently tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head — was among three Brits identified as possibly being the masked killer known as “John the Beatle.” Bary, 24, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on terror charges tied to the deadly 1998 bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Also under investigation are the brother of a British doctor once charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents, and a former gang member who converted to Islam and traveled to Syria, Britain’s Telegraph newspaper reported.

A dozen American counterterrorism experts are expected to fly to the UK “within days” to help identify Foley’s killer, Britain’s Daily Mail reported.

Former hostages held by ISIS have said he is one of several jihadists they nicknamed “the Beatles” due to their British accents, with two of his cronies referred to as “George” and “Ringo.”

Bary, who went to Syria last year to fight in its bloody civil war, has a build, skin tone and ­accent all similar to those of “John,” according to The Telegraph.

Before becoming a jihadist, he was an aspiring rapper from West London known as “L Jinny,” whose music was played on BBC Radio 1.

Bary also appeared in music videos posted on YouTube for songs titled “Overdose,” “Flying High” and “Dreamer.”

But he was reportedly radicalized by followers of firebrand ­Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and walked out of his family’s plush home in the Maida Vale district of London last year, saying he was “leaving everything for the sake of Allah.”

Earlier this month, he was seen in a photo posted to Twitter wearing camouflage clothing and a black balaclava while holding a severed head with his left hand — the same hand “John” is seen using to draw a knife across Foley’s throat in his execution video.

According to The Telegraph, Bary is on an official list of British jihadists who may be “John.”

Also on the list is Razul Islam, 21, the paper says.

In 2012, Islam’s two older brothers — including Dr. Shajul Islam, a suspended physician with England’s National Health Service — were charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents near the Syrian border with Turkey.

But the brothers were released last year after neither British journalist John Cantile nor Dutch photographer Jeroen Oerlmans appeared to testify against them.

Another suspect is Aine Davis, 30, a former drug dealer and gang member who The Telegraph said converted to Islam and flew to Syria to wage jihad.",discuss
927,Abdel Majed Abdel Bary Emerges as Suspect in Foley Beheading,"THE beheading of American journalist, James Foley, at the hands of ISIS militants shocked the world but forensic experts have revealed the video was probably staged, with the murder happening off camera.

The UK Times reported that an international forensic science company, which has worked for police forces across Britain, said there is no question Foley was beheaded but that camera trickery and post-production techniques look to have been used.

“I think it has been staged,” said one expert in visual forensics, after he was commissioned by The UK Times to examine the footage.

“My feeling is that the execution may have happened after the camera was stopped.”

Aymenn al-Tamimi, a fellow at the Middle East Forum think-tank, said over the years ISIS militants have improved the production quality of their videos.

The analysis by experts has highlighted a number of inconsistencies that could suggest that the beheading of Foley, which was seen on the video, was not his actual death.

Firstly, no blood can be seen, even though the knife is drawn across the neck area at least six times. Secondly, sounds allegedly made by Foley do not appear consistent with what may be expected.

The forensic analysis expert said that no incision could be seen on Foley’s neck, though the right hand of the jihadist partially blocked the shot.

While the forensics company, which asked to remain anonymous, did not reach a definitive answer they did conclude that at some point an execution of Foley did take place.

This comes as a heartbreaking last letter from Foley to his family has been revealed on the Free James Foley Facebook tribute page.

While Foley was not permitted to send the letter, a fellow hostage, Danish photographer Daniel Rye Ottosen, memorised it word for word.

The 25-year-old spent 13 months imprisoned with Foley and when released in June his first call was to Foley’s mother, Diane, where he dictated every word.

Foley describes fond memories with his family and how he and the eighteen other hostages being held with him are coping.

“I know you are thinking of me and praying for me. And I am so thankful. I feel you all especially when I pray. I pray for you to stay strong and to believe. I really feel I can touch you even in this darkness when I pray,” Foley said in the letter.

“I have had weak and strong days. We are so grateful when anyone is freed; but of course, yearn for our own freedom. We try to encourage each other and share strength. We are being fed better now and daily. We have tea, occasional coffee. I have regained most of my weight lost last year.”

Foley goes on to describe his hopes of attending his sisters wedding and his plans to take his grandmother out when he returns home.

“Grammy, please take your medicine, take walks and keep dancing. I plan to take you out to Margarita’s when I get home. Stay strong because I am going to need your help to reclaim my life.”

The full letter can be read here.

Yesterday, British security services MI5 and MI6 reportedly identified a British hip-hop artist as the key suspect in the hunt for the killer who beheaded American journalist James Foley.

The Sunday Times newspaper said Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, from Maida Vale in West London, had become a crucial part of the investigation.

The paper attributed the information to “senior government sources.”

Bary, 23, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on terror charges in New York tied to the deadly 1998 bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Former hostages held by ISIS have said he is one of several jihadists they nicknamed “the Beatles” due to their British accents, with two of his cronies referred to as “George” and “Ringo.”

Bary — who recently tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head — was among three Brits identified as possibly being the masked killer known as “John”.

In June, The Sunday Times revealed a threat made by Bary on Twitter. “The lions are coming for you soon you filthy kuffs (infidels),” he wrote. “Beheadings in your own backyard soon.”

Bary, who went to Syria last year to fight in its bloody civil war, has a build, skin tone and ­accent all similar to those of “John,” according to The Telegraph.

Before becoming a jihadist, he was an aspiring rapper known as “L Jinny,” whose music was played on BBC Radio 1.

Also under investigation are Abu Hussain Al-Britani, 20, a computer hacker from Birmingham, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, in his 20s, from Portsmouth, the MailOnline reported.

Mail Online reported that al-Britani was jailed in 2012 for stealing personal information from former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Since joining ISIS’ brutal campaign in Syria al-Britani, real name Junaid Hussian, has worked to fund the ISIS war chest by mounting jihadist cyber attacks on British banks and celebrities.

Abu Abdullah Al-Britani, meanwhile, is active on social media using Twitter to post pro-ISIS propaganda. According to Mail Online, he is believed to be behind an account on the ask.fm social media site giving young people advice on how to travel to Syria and Iraq and encouraging them to join the jihad.

Other possible identities for “John” include the brother of a British doctor once charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents, and a former gang member who converted to Islam and travelled to Syria, Britain’s Telegraph newspaper reported.

Islamic State militants on Tuesday released a video that purported to show the beheading of James Foley, an American freelance journalist who has been missing since he was kidnapped in Syria in November 2012.

The authenticity of the video could not be immediately verified.

When contacted by Mashable, NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said, “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

The video opens with a clip of President Barack Obama's remarks announcing the launch of airstrikes on Islamic State positions near Erbil in northern Iraq. A black screen then shows the text, ""A message to America,"" and then Foley appears kneeling in a desert landscape, wearing an orange jumpsuit with a microphone attached. A hooded man wearing all-black clothes and tan military boots is standing behind him with a gun in a leather holster.

""I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,"" Foley says, among other things, in remarks seemingly prepared for him by his captors.

The video then switches to the man in black, who is now holding a serrated knife.

""This is James Wright Foley — an American citizen of your country,"" the man says in British-accented English. ""As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards Islamic State.... Effectively, any aggression towards the Islamic State is an aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership. So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the safety of Muslims living under the safety of the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""

The man then beheads Foley, using the knife as the video fades to black. After a shot of Foley's lifeless body and decapitated head, the video switches to the executioner now standing behind another man in an orange jumpsuit, identified in text on the screen as Steven Joel Sotloff.

""The life of this American prisoner, Obama, depends on your next decision.""

Sotloff, an American freelance journalist who had been working for Time magazine among other publications, was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border on Aug. 4, 2013.

The video then goes black.

The video was first reported by Zaid Benjamin, a reporter for the Arabic-language Radio Sawa, who said that it came from Furqan Media, the official outlet for the Islamic State. (Twitter suspended — then reinstated — the account.)

The video appeared to surface first on the Twitter account @mujahid4life, belonging to someone who described himself in his Twitter bio as 19 years old, ""anti-democracy. Loyal to the Caliphate. Harsh on kuffar. #Revert""

It didn't take long before people who had worked with Foley began reacting on Twitter.

Pour water on their flame,"" said a Tumblr blogger known as LibyaLiberty on Twitter in what appeared to be the first mention of the hashtag. ""From here on out, I won't share any photo or video of violence intentionally recorded & released by ISIS for propaganda,"" she tweeted. Many others, promptly, joined her pledge.

A statement from a group called Free James Foley said: ""We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.""

Foley's parents appeared on the Today show last year, pleading for his release.

""On behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jim’s possible execution first broke. We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic,"" Balboni said.

“Although GlobalPost’s investigation at one point led us to believe that James was being held by the Syrian government, we later were given strong reason to believe he was being held by Islamic rebels in Syria,"" he added. ""We withheld this information at the request of the family and on the advice of authorities cooperating in the effort to protect Jim. GlobalPost, working with a private security company, has amassed an enormous amount of information that has not been made public.”

Foley reported in Syria for GlobalPost as a freelancer.

929,"Man cuts off manhood, throws it in the bin, after girlfriend leaves over small penis","LONDON — The world knows him as “Jihadi John,” the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online.

But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolize.

“I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,” said one of Emwazi’s close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. “He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him.”

[View: The atrocities of the Islamic State]

A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held.

“There was an extremely strong resemblance,” Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said after watching one of the videos. “This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.”

Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John. James B. Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September — only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley — that officials believed they had succeeded.

Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foley’s killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded.

In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm.

A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: “Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues.” ISIL is another name for the Islamic State.

U.S. officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazi’s family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice.

The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said.

He was raised in a middle-class neighborhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich.

The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalize after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster.

Emwazi and two friends — a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib — never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. It’s unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported.

Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britain’s domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post.

Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda.

The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam.

Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. “Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,” Qureshi said.

Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalize his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait.

In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again — this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so.

“I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,” he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now “I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait.”

Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had “heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!!”

In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice.

“This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation,” Qureshi said. In the end, he felt “actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions.”

Close friends of Emwazi’s also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. It’s unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how.

One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone.

“He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere,” one of the friends said. “He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out.”

Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. It’s unclear what he told them about his activities there.

A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility “the box.” Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed “George.” A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages.

Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. “He was the most deliberate,” a former hostage said.

Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic State’s de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State.

About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi.

“I was wondering if you could send me your number,” he wrote. “Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up.”

There was no response.

930,This Woman Exposed Her Cheating Boyfriend With A Brilliant Christmas Gift,"India is going through some serious public sector reforms under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. So not turning up for work for a quarter of a century is now not OK, as one civil servant found out recently.

India's Central Public Works Department (CPWD), in a press release dated Jan. 8, 2015, announced the dismissal of a senior electrical engineer employed by the department for 35 years. He only worked the first 10.

It sounds like the CPWD could use a bit of reorganisation. The employee stopped turning up for work in 1990, and an inquiry was launched in 1992. The department then seems to have forgotten about it for 13 years:

Charges were clearly established six years ago, but Verma apparently remained in employment for another eight years until he was sacked today. It's not clear from the press release whether he was paid over the whole period. In 2014, a German civil servant admitted he hadn't done any work in the last 14 years, but Verma beats him by a decade.",unrelated
931,"Google to buy big chunk of Pacific Shores, iconic Redwood City office park","Google Inc. plans to buy about half of Redwood City's mammoth Pacific Shores Center office campus in a stunning deal that could reshuffle the Peninsula real estate scene.

Even by the standards of Google’s relentless real-estate acquisition spree, this is a big one. The world's biggest search-engine company is buying six office buildings totaling nearly a million square feet, according to several industry sources who were not willing to talk about the deal publicly. The project is owned by the Blackstone Group and Starwood Capital and managed by Equity Office.

The purchase — which could close later this month — would be Mountain View-based Google’s most dramatic real estate move this year. It opens up another front in the search giant’s rapid Peninsula expansion after big deals in Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. And it provides a potential seaborne solution to increasingly gridlocked highways: Pacific Shores is spitting distance from the Port of Redwood City, where Google has been experimenting with commuter ferries as a way to reduce the demands on its extensive bus network.

Google declined to comment. Blackstone didn’t respond to a request for comment. I’m told the sale is close to being finalized, though it’s still possible the deal could still fall through. Google's deposit isn't yet non-refundable, a customary marker for a deal headed toward the finish line, a person familiar with the transaction said.

“If any deal is done by anyone, we’d welcome them to Redwood City,” Mayor Jeffrey Gee told me in a phone call on Friday, adding that he’d wait to comment on Google’s potential arrival until a deal is complete.

Brokers said the impact of the acquisition, if completed, would ripple through the commercial real estate market. Assuming Google intends to occupy the space, tenants currently in the buildings — which are more than 90 percent leased — would have to find new space as their leases end. And Google tends to grow wherever it puts down roots.

“It adds fuel to the fire for more spec buildings to start coming out of the ground, because there’s going to be that much more pressure on space demand,” said Tim Grant, a veteran Bay Area office broker with Avison Young in Foster City.

The deal would mark another sign of tech companies taking a shine to the north Peninsula, coming just weeks after Box Inc. agreed to lease a major office project in downtown Redwood City.

“This is one more thing,” Grant said. “We’ve always been thought of as, ‘Maybe, but I’d rather be in San Francisco or (southern) Silicon Valley.’ Suddenly, the middle maybe isn’t a bad place to be.”

Google is expected to buy Blackstone and Starwood’s buildings at 1200, 1300, 1600, 1700, 1800 and 1900 Seaport Blvd., which total 934,000 square feet and are home to tenants such as Zazzle Inc. and Rocket Fuel. Google is not buying 2000 and 2100 Seaport Blvd., the owner-occupied headquarters of Informatica Corp. Nor is Google buying 1400 and 1500 Seaport Blvd., which includes DreamWorks. Those buildings are owned by Shorenstein, which has been in contract for a while to sell them to San Francisco-based investor DivcoWest, according to sources and public records.

The price Google will pay was not immediately clear, but an observer estimated it at “substantially more” than the $525 per square foot that Informatica paid for the two buildings it bought in 2012.

One of the Valley’s marquee campuses, Pacific Shores was built by Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s and broke new ground for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools, a rock-climbing wall, day spa and baseball diamonds. It was one of the first major developments that showed multiple tech companies would share the same campus, and rose taller than the one- and two-story buildings that were the standard for tech. Starwood bought the campus in 2006 for about $833 million, and immediately sold Shorenstein its two buildings. Blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years ago.

A new owner could build even more office space there, city officials said. The entire campus contains about 1.7 million square feet of office space, and new zoning approved about a year ago could allow total build-out of up to 3 million square feet.

“All things considered, there's still quite a bit of room to put more structures out there,” said Sailesh Mehra, associate city planner for the city. “You could essentially double that entire office park, if you can you could park it.”

Google — which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom — may be eyeing transit options beyond freeways. Pacific Shores is a half mile from the Port of Redwood City, where a Google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from San Francisco and Alameda to the port. The Water Emergency Transportation Authority, which administers the San Francisco Bay Ferry routes, has studied regular public ferry service to Redwood City, with a potential public terminal practically next door to Pacific Shores.

""I know they really liked the ferry and the concept. Their challenge was getting people off a boat and putting them on a bus to Mountain View, and that was taking 25 minutes,"" said Kevin Connolly, director of planning and development for WETA. ""This might be one way to address it.""

San Mateo County has about $22 million left in a sales-tax funded pot for ferry services in the county. A Redwood City terminal would cost about $15 million. But the county doesn't have ongoing operational funding, Connolly said.

A major built-in user such as Google could help make service pencil out, he said.

""If they're serious about doing it, we could do something, and there are lots of options,"" Connolly said. ""We could be very creative about working this out.""

If the deal is completed, it would probably take several years for Google to truly put its stamp on Redwood City. Tenants are in the buildings long term, and Google’s continued expansion elsewhere in Silicon Valley — it just leased another 424,000 square feet in Sunnyvale— means it’s probably not under immediate pressure to occupy the campus.

The current and future Google growth ""(is) going to impact the face of the Valley,"" Mark Bodie, a senior vice president with JLL who represents landlords, said on a market update call with media earlier this week,. ""It's really going to change the dynamics of what's available for lease.""

932,"Calm down everyone, Banksy hasn't been arrested: 9 clues that it's a hoax","Banksy has not been arrested. Let's not bury the lede here, people. The news of his incarceration is, yet again, a hoax.

If you woke up this morning to a Twitter feed filled with recycled ""OMG BANKSY WAS ARRESTED/WTF BANKSY WAS NOT ARRESTED"" exclamations, here's why.

This week's fickle rumor started with The National Report, which for those unaware, is an American satire site. A satirical post on the site reported, in a joking fashion lost on many an Internet surfer, that a 35-year-old man had been apprehended by authorities in the London suburb of Watford early Monday morning. It claimed that a press conference had validated that the man was indeed Banksy, that the BBC confirmed the information in their report, and that five men in total had been snagged with counterfeit money and ""future projects of vandalism.""

So illicit! So false.

Just to be extra clear, here are a few things that did not happen today: The anonymous British street artist was not caught by a ""24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force."" Police did not raid his studio in the middle of the night like a carefully plotted drug bust. His name is not and never will be Paul Horner.

We do appreciate the fact that someone out there is trying her hardest to make the name ""Paul Horner"" a thing. Remember last year, when some trolly press release tried to convince the masses that a Banksy arrest happened? The name of the apprehended: Paul Horner.

Pope Francis, talking to a distraught boy whose pet had died, declared there was a place in heaven for the creatures we share our lives with. His comment was reported this week by many news media outside Italy, with dozens of articles in the United States. It was veritable catnip to social media.

However, it turned out the pope had not made the comment.

Misreading of remarks

The news stories were apparently based on a misreading of remarks Pope Francis made at his weekly general audience at the Vatican on Nov. 26 and on a comment that a past pope did make several decades ago.

Pope Paul VI, who died in 1978, once said, reportedly while comforting a child whose dog had died, ""one day we will see our animals in the eternity of Christ.""

'There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done.'
- Vatican's deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini
""There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done,"" the Vatican's deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini, said on Saturday, when asked about how the media ran with the story.

The spokesman said he received a number of calls on the story from outside Italy on Friday and was taken by surprise because he did not recall the pope saying anything like that.

Religion News Service was among the first media to put the record straight. It said in an article published late on Friday that the error appeared to have stemmed from a piece in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Nov. 27, whose headline was misleading.

The article recounted the pope's words from his general audience on Nov. 26, when the topic was the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth. It cited the remark about animals and attributed it to Paul VI, but its headline said ""The pope and animals. 'paradise is open to all creatures.'""

The New York Times, which ran a story on Thursday about the purported comment by Francis, acknowledged its mistake, saying in a correction on Friday that it had misattributed the remark by Paul VI to the current pope.

A spokeswoman for the New York Times did not immediately have any comment.

On its website, CNN also corrected its story, noting the misattribution and saying it was unclear what Francis believes about pets going to heaven. A spokeswoman for CNN had no immediate comment.

Reuters did not publish a story on the remarks erroneously attributed to Francis.

What does Pope Francis think about pets?

As for what Francis does think about animals, he has not spoken much about them in public, but Benedettini said that from the general tone of his speeches and gestures ""it is clear that he is in spiritual harmony with all of creation.""

The spokesman said the pope was preparing an encyclical that will deal in part with the environment and recalled that a group that looks after stray dogs once brought the animals to his general audience and the pope was pleased.

When he made a Christmas season visit to a Rome parish last year, Francis willingly let a young girl place a lamb on his shoulders as a shepherd would carry it. The pope once told priests that a good pastor should know not only the names of his parishioners but also the names of their dogs, Benedettini said.

Recent popes have said different things about the possible spiritual side of animals.

In 1990, Pope John Paul implied that animals had souls because they too were created from the breath of God. In 2008, former Pope Benedict upset some animal lovers when he said only humans were ""called to eternity.""",unrelated
935,Animal lovers abuzz over pope’s comments that 'paradise is open to all of God’s creatures',"Brian Williams took a moment during Monday’s edition of NBC Nightly News to address a very important issue. As the anchor said, social media, as well as a few news websites, owes meteorologist Mike Seidel an “apology” after some “wild misinformation” circulated about what he was doing during a live appearance with Lester Holt over the weekend.

Williams explained that Seidel has lost communication with the NBC station and couldn’t hear Holt through his earpiece so he turned his back to the camera, took off his gloves and redialed his phone to connect for the segment.

“That’s when the rumors hit the web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow,” Williams said. “It was just Mike working to make it right, which is why we all love working with Mike Seidel.”

But, of course, that explanation is far less hilarious and would likely generate almost zero clicks.

936,Who Is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau? Ottawa Shooter Suspect Identified By Canadian Officials ,"Since sexually active girls aged between 13 and 15 have increased significantly in recent years, the case has sparked nationwide discussions about sex education in Bosnia.

""That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,"" Senad Mehmedbasic, a gynecologist from Sarajevo, said, describing the growing trend as ""worrying.""

937,Accountant Claims Comcast Got Him Fired From His Job for Reporting a Customer Service Issue,"Two of the nation’s leading experts on the use of deadly force by the police are warning against overreaction to an audio recording that purportedly captures the sound of the gunshots that killed Michael Brown.

The newly surfaced recording, which has not been publicly verified by investigators, was first broadcast by CNN.

On the 12-second clip, it is possible to hear a series of what appears to be quick pops, followed by a brief pause and then another succession of rapid shots. St. Louis attorney Lopa Blumenthal and her client, who wishes to remain anonymous to the public, took the recording to the FBI on Monday. Blumenthal says she counted 11 shots fired.

“There's that pause, which is what gave me pause, when I first saw it,” Blumenthal told Yahoo News. “It was a pause so there was time to think about it and deliberate. That doesn't mean that I'm saying it helps one side or the other. But I do know that in a 12-second tape, where eight seconds of it is a shooting, a three-second delay is a significant period of time.”

Ron Martinelli and Michael Levine, both longtime criminal justice consultants, told Yahoo News that the audio needs to be authenticated and considered with other evidence before its importance can be evaluated.

“Pauses may or may not be anything of tremendous significance,” said Martinelli, a retired officer and criminologist specializing in police practices. “The answer is: It depends. In the end, this is about a forensic reconciliation of statements and forensic facts and evidence.”

Levine, a retired DEA agent and law enforcement trainer, said that anyone willing to put a value on a recording before it has been corroborated is discrediting themselves.

“If they gave that opinion on a witness stand, they would be chewed up and spit out by any defense attorney, even a defense attorney that got his degree at Sears & Roebuck School of Law,” Levine said.

Blumenthal told Yahoo News that she has no qualms about bringing the recording forward.

“There's no bad evidence, there's just evidence,” Blumenthal said. “It doesn't take sides. It helps lead to where you are going and discover the truth. Every little bit helps.”

The potential new discovery comes to light more than two weeks after Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, in broad daylight in the middle of a residential street.

The audio was unwittingly captured by a man taping  an online web chat inside his apartment near the shooting scene.

On the recording, the unidentified Ferguson resident is heard complimenting a friend’s looks during a video chat, when two bursts of loud pops erupt in the background.

Blumenthal said her client heard the noise, but paid it no attention because gunshots are common in the neighborhood. The unidenitifed man, she said, had to be persuaded to come forward.

“Even after I talked to them about it, they were very dubious that it had any type of value,” Blumenthal said. “My client nor I are seeking any publicity or attention at all. There's no motivation to say it is what it's not.""

Blumenthal said she and her client were interviewed by FBI agents about the recording late Monday.

Federal and state investigators are conducting separate criminal and civil rights investigations into the controversial shooting.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has said Wilson was attempting to tell Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, to stop walking in the middle of the road, when the officer realized that the pair fit the description of suspects being sought in the theft of cigars from a nearby convenience store.

Chief Jackson said a scuffle ensued after the teen struck Wilson in the face and that a shot was fired inside the officer’s squad car as Brown attempted to grab the officer’s gun. But Johnson has told reporters that it was Wilson who was the aggressor, and that Brown never went for the weapon. Instead, Johnson says, the officer shot his friend while Brown was trying to flee but had stopped and put his hands up in surrender.

Wilson, 28, is on paid leave and has not spoken publicly about the shooting.

Blumenthal said her client gave a copy of the recording to federal investigators.

“(The FBI) thought this would be an important piece of the investigation,” she told CNN.

An FBI spokesperson declined to address the issue of the recording when contacted by Yahoo News on Tuesday.

FBI audio engineers are reportedly planning to analyze the recording for authenticity.

Mark O’Mara, the Florida attorney who successfully defended shooting suspect George Zimmerman, told CNN that while it may be too early judge the audio’s significance, the scientific review could unearth new evidence.

“I look forward to hearing if that tape has Mike Brown’s or Darren Wilson’s voice on it saying stop,” O’Mara said.

Separate autopsies performed on Brown revealed that he was struck at least six times, including by what was likely a fatal shot to the top of his head. Authorities have not disclosed how many times Wilson fired his weapon.
Veteran forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg listened to the recording on Tuesday.

“The gunshots are unmistakable,"" Ginsberg told Yahoo News.

By Ginsberg’s count, he said, there are 10 shots on the recording, but he said he could understand why an untrained ear might hear more.

“I can confidently say that I heard at least 10 shots,” said Ginsberg, who has worked on such major investigations as the Sandy Hook school shooting. “I'm hearing six shots, followed by very close to three seconds of pause, followed by four more shots.”

Messages sent to Ferguson police seeking information on the type of service weapon that it assigns to officers went unanswered on Tuesday. Levine said officers across the country commonly carry semi-automatic pistols with a capacity of 15 to 17 bullets.

Any potential pause in Wilson’s shooting would have to be weighed against statements given to investigators, Levine said.

Levine said the pause “would raise an alarm if I had qualified witness statements and the officer’s statement that conflicts with that.” He added, “But I don’t know what this officer’s official statement is here. I don’t think anyone does.”

939,Brian Williams slams social media for speculation weatherman Mike Seidel relieved himself on air,"NBC's lead anchor defended the meteorologist and explained that he had lost contact with the control room and was trying to call them with his cellphone. Seidel was unknowingly placed on live television Saturday night while his back was turned to the camera, fueling the incorrect rumors.

After hundreds of mentions on social media the past two days, NBC News anchor Brian Williams slammed those who speculated they caught meteorologist Mike Seidel relieving himself live on air and said they owe him an apology.

The anchor for the network's “Nightly News” program chose to squash the Internet rumors on Monday's broadcast that Seidel was caught ""writing his name on the snow"" when reporting from a major snowstorm in North Carolina Saturday.

""Social media owes our friend Mike Seidel an apology,” Williams declared.

On Saturday’s broadcast, anchor Lester Holt said they were going to the station's No. 1 meteorologist for a report.

Seidel appeared to be, well, a wee bit busy, as his back was turned to the camera and he was slightly hunched forward. A few seconds after he was introduced he could be heard asking ""Why?"" and then turned around and put on his gloves.

The strange television blooper from Sugar Mountain, N.C., fueled speculation that he was relieving himself behind some trees.

The segment also led to some teasing for the weather professional.

""Oh, to pee on Sugar Mountain With the barometers and the weather balloons @MikeSeidel peed on Sugar Mountain But @NBCNews cut away too soon,"" tweeted the fake Brian Williams account.

The social media analytics site Topsy reports Seidel had more than 250 mentions since Saturday's broadcast.

But the speculation was incorrect and Williams wanted to make sure his audience of about 8 million nightly viewers knew the real story.

""The intrepid and fearless Weather Channel meteorologist was the victim of some wild misinformation,"" he said on the telecast.

He then explained Seidel had lost cellphone contact with the control room and couldn't hear through his attached earpiece, he didn't know he was on the air and took off his gloves so he could call them with his phone that was tethered to his ear. His phone had lost its signal, a network spokesman told the Daily News.

""That's when the rumors hit the Web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow,"" Williams said. ""It was just Mike working to make it right, which is why we all love working with Mike Seidel.""

940,Michael Phelps’ alleged girlfriend says she was born intersex,"You want a gold Apple Watch, you say? Then it's going to cost you... a lot. 

The vanilla variant of Apple's newest wrist-worn wearable device only costs $349. However, if you're willing to spend big cash on something that has the Apple logo on it, the company would be more than willing to accommodate. 

According to analyst John Gruber, the gold version of the upcoming device may cost about as much as the monthly salary of a middle-class worker in the United States. Gruber predicts that the gold Apple Watch would cost $5,000. The figure is basically just a guess. However, it's not an uneducated one. 

""Most people think I'm joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000. I couldn't be more serious,"" Gruber wrote in a blog post. ""The lowest conceivable price I could see for the Edition models is $1,999 -- but the gold alone, just as scrap metal, might in fact be worth more than that.""

Gruber claims that Apple told him that the gold version of the Apple Watch is made of solid 18-karat gold. It is not gold-plated. This caused him to revise his guess on the price of the device.  

He based his estimate on the going rate for solid gold watches from other manufacturers. Challenging people to find a solid gold watch that costs less than $20,000, he cited a leaked price list for Rolex from 2012. Luxury watch companies don't set prices for their products; they leave that to their authorized dealers. This means that the products on the price list may have ended up being sold for a higher price. In the list, an 18-karat gold Rolex had a price tag of $34,250.


Gruber suspects that the reason Apple has been mostly silent about the specs for the device is that they don't know what the capabilities of the finished product would be. 

""What does Apple Watch actually do? Or, rather, what does WatchKit allow? We don't know. And Apple is not talking, even off the record. One factor is that the software (and perhaps the hardware internals remain a work in progress). It is far from a finished product,"" he said. 

Aside from the gold version, Gruber also predicts a stainless steel version of the device that costs $999. It's not clear whether fancier variants of the device would be available with the sport version at launch. Nonetheless, the Apple Watch is expected to ship in early 2015.",unrelated

He pleaded guilty in February of 2012 to the lesser charge of uttering threats, for which he was sentenced to one day in jail in addition to 66 days credit for time served.

Court records indicate he was seen by a psychiatrist while in jail and found fit for trial.

The Vancouver police and the B.C. RCMP have confirmed they are working with the municipal police and Mounties in Ottawa, though they have declined to provide any more information.

As of 2004, Zehaf-Bibeau’s address was located in Montreal’s Villeray neighbourhood along St. Dominique.

The Ottawa Citizen reported that a Zehaf-Bibeau listed an Aylmer, Quebec address when he was charged with breaching release conditions from a previous charge.

942,"Gill Rosenberg, Canadian-Israeli Woman Feared Kidnapped By ISIS, Says She's Safe","Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured. Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page. The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story ""mere propaganda"". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible. Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting. Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north. Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg's status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet.

943,Reports of missing Libyan planes raise 9/11 terror fears,"A small meteorite landed near the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, on Saturday night, government officials say.

Residents reported hearing a loud bang and feeling the impact, which left a crater 12m (40ft) wide and 5m deep.

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said the meteorite seemed to have broken off an asteroid which was passing close to Earth.

She said international experts had been called in to investigate further.

No-one was hurt when it hit the wooded area near the international airport and an air force base.

'Like a bomb'

An adviser to Nicaragua's Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter), Wilfried Strauch, said he was ""convinced it was a meteorite"" which caused the impact.

Experts studying the crater said it was not clear whether the meteorite had disintegrated upon impact or had been blasted into soil.

Locals said they heard a large blast just before midnight local time and reported a burning smell.

""We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria told Associated Press news agency.

Asteroid link?

Ineter scientist Jose Millan said that ""we need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population"".

Managua, which has more than a million inhabitants is densely populated.

""All the evidence that we've confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event,"" he said.

""We have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact,"" he added.

Astronomer Humberto Saballos said the meteorite could have broken off from the 2014RC asteroid which passed Earth at the same time.

2014RC, which is the size of a house, came closest to earth at 18:18 GMT on Sunday, when it passed over New Zealand at a distance of about 40,000km (25,000 miles).

The asteroid was first discovered on 31 August and, at its closest approach, was about one-tenth of the distance from the centre of Earth to the Moon, Nasa said in a statement.

It is expected to orbit near Earth again in the future.

In February 2013, a meteorite exploded over Chelyabinsk in Central Russia, injuring more than 1,000 people.

Nasa currently tracks more than 11,000 asteroids in orbits that pass relatively close to Earth.",unrelated
944,Batmobile Rumored To Have Been Stolen From Batman V. Superman: Dawn Of Justice Set,"A baseball cap and a portrait of Michael Brown is shown alongside his casket inside Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church before the start of funeral services in St. Louis, Missouri. Photo: Reuters

Ferguson: An audio recording released on Tuesday morning may shed light on the death of a Missouri teenager fatally shot by a police officer August 9, which have sparked protests that resumed this week.

The tape, provided to CNN, allegedly contains audio captured during a Ferguson resident's video chat at the time of the shooting. CNN says the authenticity of the tape has yet to be verified, but what appears to be gunfire can be heard in the background of the call.

As many as 10 shot-like sounds can be heard. Several shots are fired in what appears to be fairly quick succession. There is a brief pause, then more shots are fired.

An autopsy concluded that Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times, with two fatal shots to the head. The Ferguson officer involved has been identified as Darren Wilson, 28.

Law enforcement officials and bystanders have provided differing accounts of what led to the fatal encounter. Police say Mr Wilson stopped Brown and a friend for walking in the street, asking the two to move to the sidewalk, and words were exchanged. According to Mr Wilson's account, he was attacked by Brown as he attempted to exit his cruiser and the two scuffled for the officer's gun inside the car.

Both Mr Wilson and witnesses concede Brown took off running. The witnesses say the officer fired on the unarmed teen as he had his hands up to surrender. Wilson supporters say Brown was bull-rushing Wilson, who shot Brown in self-defense.

The shooting ignited racial tensions, sparking several days and nights of protests, riots, looting and unrest, which have resumed.

More than 100 demonstrators marched in St. Louis on Tuesday demanding the arrest of a white police officer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.

The protesters, who called for Mr Wilson's arrest and the removal of Ferguson police leaders, were blocked from walking up the courthouse steps by a group of officers, most on bicycles.

Few signs were visible at what has been the centre of the protests along West Florissant in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb.

A man under a gazebo sold T-shirts that read ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" the chant favoured by demonstrators, as the temperature reached 34 Celsius at midday.

People gathered in small groups at the impromptu memorial set up where Brown died and two women handed out food from a folding table.

""This community has had a story to tell for a long time and this has just been the catalyst,"" said Chelsea Warlick, 29, a photographer from Savannah, Georgia. The majority of people in Ferguson are black, while most of its elected officials and police force are white.

Ms Warlick, who laid white roses by the memorial, said she was about to sign a six-month lease on an apartment in the complex where Brown lived to support the community.

""The verdict is everything. If he doesn't go to jail for what he did this place is going to burn,"" she said of Mr Wilson.

The Missouri National Guard, which began a gradual pullout from Ferguson on Friday, was absent from a spot on West Florissant they had occupied late on Monday.

Brown's funeral service was Monday, and the case is currently being presented to a grand jury. Attorney General Eric Holder has promised a thorough investigation.

The organisation Black Lawyers for Justice plans to file a $US200 million class action lawsuit against Ferguson authorities Tuesday, KDSK-TV reported. According to the organisation's website, the group's mission is to fight police brutality.

945,Star Wars 7: JJ Abrams want to move release to summer 2015,"In quite recent news, J J Abrams has reportedly said at the Visual Effects Society Awards (2015) that he may release his extremely anticipated film, Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens. instead of winter he may move his film down the line for a summer release! This is an extremely brave move (if true) as it puts Star Wars up against films like Avengers 2: Age Of Ultron, Ant-Man and the long awaited Jurassic World but who would win at the summer box office if it were to happen? In my opinion Star Wars has got the strongest chance at the box office if moved to a summer release but why would he do it? All the big films come out in the summer and I mean there's no Hobbit to compete with in December so why move it down to Summer?

Box office championship.
Box office championship.
J J's biggest reason was reported to be that all of the Star Wars plot leaks and pictures of characters had sent him on a little scare that more and more would be leaked therefore making the film predictable and not worth watching. For example just one photo can give away a lot for instance: (If you don't want spoilers look away!)

Sorry J J!
Sorry J J!
For instance these 5 figures reveal the character's Kylo Ren, Rey, Fin, BB-8 and shows us what Kylo Ren (ol' crossguard) will look like with his outer cloak removed. I do see that if more of these pictures are leaked we could be seeing what Han, Leia, Luke, C3PO etc. will be like in the film before seeing a company made trailer, which would ruin the surprise. Disney, being the owners of the new Star Wars franchise, have taken J J's thoughts into consideration and deep thought which could get the film released a lot earlier than we thought we were going to see it! There are some bad things about this though... If we do get what we all wish for and we get to see Star Wars 7 about 6 months before we thought we were going to, won't Disney be in a panic? If they thought that their blockbuster was coming in December would they have ordered toy designs, trailers etc. for later on in the year? Perhaps this is just paranoia but Disney and J J will have a lot of work to get done if they want their merchandise etc. to come alongside Star Wars in summer.

946,Turkish Leader Says U.S. Airdrop Aided ISIS Militants,"Online retail giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.98%  plans to open its first brick-and-mortar store, according to people familiar with the plans.

The site, set to open in time for the holiday-shopping season on Manhattan’s busy 34th Street, would mark an experiment by Amazon to connect with customers in the physical world. Amazon has built its business on competitive pricing and fast shipping. Until now, though, it couldn’t compete with the immediacy of a traditional store.

Amazon’s space at 7 West 34th St., across from the Empire State Building in Midtown, would function as a mini-warehouse, with limited inventory for same-day delivery within New York, product returns and exchanges, and pickups of online orders.

Opening a physical location is “about marketing the Amazon brand,” said Matt Nemer, a Wells Fargo analyst. “Same-day delivery, ordering online and picking up in store are ideas that are really catching on. Amazon needs to be at the center of that.”

Amazon also may consider using the space to showcase inventory, particularly its devices like the Kindle e-readers, Fire smartphone or Fire TV set-top box, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking.

Operating stores also carries risks. Until now, Amazon has largely avoided some costs associated with retailing, including leases, paying employees and managing inventory in hundreds of stores. Those expenses could imperil the company’s already thin profit margins.

Some details about the New York store couldn't be learned immediately, including the size, length of the lease or amount of inventory that would be housed there. People familiar with the matter cautioned that Amazon’s plans could change, and that the store is an experiment and could be deemed unsuccessful.

If it is successful, however, the New York location could presage a rollout to other U.S. cities, according to the people familiar with the company’s thinking.

Amazon has studied opening a brick-and-mortar outlet for years, even scouting locations in its hometown Seattle about two years ago before scrapping the idea, said another person familiar with the effort. Amazon once sold Kindles in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. outlets, but those retailers pulled the devices from shelves two years ago in an apparent nod to Amazon’s growing power in retailing.

The 12-story building on 34th Street, owned by Vornado Realty Trust, once housed an Ohrbach’s department store and now has Mango and Express stores at street level. There are two loading docks at the back of the building.

The Amazon store will be in the shadow of the Empire State Building, which last year attracted 4.3 million visitors to its observatory. It is a block east of Herald Square, where Macy’s Inc. flagship store draws more than 20 million annual visitors, according to the 34th Street Partnership, a business-improvement district.

“Foot traffic on 34th Street is unparalleled,” said Chase Welles, executive vice president at SCG Retail, a real-estate service company.

The streetscape of 34th Street has changed dramatically since the 1990s, when it was populated by low-end retailers. Since then, the business-improvement district and area companies have spent about $2 billion on upgrades to the neighborhood and individual properties, according to the 34th Street Partnership. Global and national retailers such as Zara, Uniqlo and Vince Camuto have opened stores on the street.

Vornado Chief Financial Officer Stephen Theriot hailed the 34th Street building on a recent conference call with analysts. “As a former department store, it’s got very high ceilings, it is got big, open floor plates, and that’s the type of property that a lot of the creative class tenants” favor, he said.


Amazon has studied opening a brick-and-mortar outlet for years, even scouting locations in its hometown Seattle about two years ago before scrapping the idea. Bloomberg
Ordering online with the option to pick up in stores has proved popular; retailers including Wal-Mart, Home Depot Inc. and Macy’s, offer the service. Others employ delivery services such as Google Inc., eBay Inc. or startup Deliv Inc. to fetch orders from stores, rather than warehouses, and bring them to customers.

Amazon has experimented with physical stores before, including pop-up shops and locations run by subsidiaries. Last November, Kindle-brand pop-ups appeared in U.S. malls, selling e-readers and tablets from vending machines. Its Zappos unit has a store near its Kentucky distribution center and once operated a few outlets in its hometown Las Vegas; and its Quidsi unit runs a cosmetics store in Manhasset, N.Y.

Amazon also has set up large metal lockers in convenience stores and parking garages around the country, to accommodate deliveries and returns. The lockers don’t offer same-day delivery, however. The lockers have been a popular option and Amazon has expanded them to a number of cities, including overseas, after initially just offering them in Seattle.

Amazon took some inspiration from a trial by the U.K.’s Home Retail Group PLC, allowing customers to order eBay goods online and pick them up in its Argos stores, said one person familiar with Amazon’s thinking. By year’s end Argos expects to provide the service at 650 stores from 65,000 eBay sellers.

Other primarily online retailers have opened physical storefronts, including clothier Bonobos Inc., eyeglasses purveyor Warby Parker, and subscription beauty-products service Birchbox.

New York-based Bonobos opened its first of 10 retail stores in 2011; it plans 40 by 2016, said Chief Executive Andy Dunn. The stores offer limited inventory so customers can determine their size and choose styles and patterns; the merchandise is then shipped to their home from a warehouse, or can be collected later in-store.

Mr. Dunn said customers who order clothing from Bonobos brick-and-mortar stores spend roughly twice as much as online shoppers.",unrelated
947,Heartwarming video shows son revealing he’s paid off parent’s mortgage as a Christmas gift,"At least not anytime soon

The internet has been salivating at the prospect of getting stoned and eating fried chicken this week, after reports circulated that KFC is to become a marijuana dispensary as well as a restaurant.

A story on Racket Report claimed that with tax revenue from sales of the drug being so high in Colorado, KFC wanted a piece of the action, with the added benefit that its chicken would see a boost in sales thanks to the munchies.

It looks to be false for several reasons however:

- Racket Report has carried a lot of hoax stories in the past

- KFC hasn't mentioned marijuana on its official news page

- Marijuana sales are currently cash only which would make things tricky for the chain

- Marijuana is still in somewhat of a legal grey area and probably not crystal clear enough for a giant brand to start slinging it

- KFC doesn't even sell alcohol, so they'd really be jumping in at the deep end

While weed might not be hitting KFC any time soon, with sweeping legalisation in the US this sort of thing is inevitable.

Only yesterday, Ben & Jerry's said they'd be up for creating cannabis-infused ice-cream once it's completely legal.

948,Video Messaging App Says Audio Recording Of Michael Brown's Shooting Is Authentic,"A new rumor making the rounds today claims that on a recent trip to Germany Apple CEO Tim Cook was overheard telling a retail employee that the waterproofing of the Apple Watch has improved since it was unveiled last year, apparently it can even be worn in the shower, when this device was shown off for the first time the company didn’t say if it was waterproof enough to be worn while swimming or taking a shower.
The rumor from iGen.fr claims that Cook was speaking to employees at a retail store in Berlin where he told them that the wears his Apple Watch everywhere, “even in the shower.”
It should be kept in mind though that when the Apple Watch was unveiled last year the company had only said that the device was good for wearing in the rain, getting sweaty during a workout and washing hands. There was no mention of showers or swimming pools.
While it is possible that Apple has tweaked the watch enough that its now good for those tasks as well, one can’t discount the possibility that Cook might simply have been misheard, so we’ll really have to wait until the device arrives to find out just how resistant it is to water.
The Apple Watch will start shipping to customers in April.

950,Banksy arrest hoax: US website claims street artist caught in Watford,"If you’ve seen a story floating around on your Facebook feed about Banksy getting arrested and exposed, don’t worry because Banksy is still anonymous and well. The hoax was the work of a “satirical” news site called The National Report — which I’m not linking because f*ck those guys — that makes up fake stories that sound like they could be ostensibly true, usually without a trace of actual satire, as filthy, filthy clickbait. It’s an awful yet unfortunately effective business model.

In a story which was published early this morning, The National Report claimed that Banksy was arrested in London by a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force and revealed to be a 35-year-old man named Paul Horner. The International Business Times did some quick fact checking and exposed the story to be a hoax:

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users $2.99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15-year-old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager’s house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4.

The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics, a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who, unsurprisingly since his previous stories include ‘Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month’ and ‘Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis’, has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism.

HAHA get it? It’s funny because it’s not true! I guess there’s some logic in there somewhere.

Dan Olsen, who has made 35 career PGA Tour starts and was an exempt player for the 2004 season, made the claim Friday on radio station WVFN to host David DeMarco.

“I’ve heard that he’s on a month(-long) suspension,” Olsen said, claiming the information came from “exempt Tour players.” Olsen said Woods did not test positive for testosterone but for “something else.”

Olsen continued, “I think when it’s all said and done, he’s going to surpass Lance Armstrong in infamy.”

Woods’ agent Mark Steinberg released a statement to Golf News Net, saying, “These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false. They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.”

PGA Tour media official Joel Schuchmann released a statement on behalf of the Tour, saying, “Regarding the allegations made by Dan Olsen concerning Tiger Woods, there is no truth whatsoever to his claims and the PGA Tour categorically denies them.”

The Michigan-based pro added he believes Woods was faking the back tightness that Woods cited in withdrawing from the Farmers Insurance Open after just 11 holes.

Olsen, whose last PGA Tour start was the 2011 PGA Championship, also made several wild accusations concerning Woods’ golf ball, incorrectly identifying dates during which Woods made changes in the ball he uses. Olsen alluded to comments made by Golf Channel analyst Frank Nobilo concerning the advantage he felt Woods had in 2000 (not 1998 or 1999 as Olsen claimed) in switching to Nike’s first solid-core golf ball. After switch in May 2000, Woods went on to win the final three majors that year, just before Titleist introduced its Pro V1.

Further, Olsen claimed Rory McIlroy wanted out of his Nike contract if he couldn’t have access to the same ball as Woods.

Switching subjects, Olsen also claimed PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem personally visited Dustin Johnson’s home twice in an effort to help the pro with his “personal challenges” before a six-month leave of absence from golf that ended in February. Johnson has disputed a Golf.com report saying he was suspended for that half-year period because of a failed drug test under the Tour’s anti-doping program.",unrelated

The government and Kurdish media reported that militants were displaying symptoms similar to those of Ebola. The World Health Organization has not been able to confirm this but has offered assistance to Iraqi officials.

Iraq's official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, said Ebola arrived in Mosul from ""terrorists"" who came ""from several countries and Africa"", reports Mashable.

However, it is uncertain if any IS recruits came from the Ebola-hit regions of West Africa. Most have come from Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan and Somalia.

A number of other illnesses could be to blame for the fighters' symptoms. Malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever and the Marburg virus could all be confused with Ebola as they can also cause fever, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.

IS, a group that has been known to dismiss some aspects of science and modern medicine, recently executed a number of Iraqi doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat militants. UN workers have also been prohibited from entering their territory, an intelligence analyst who specialises in Iraq told Mashable.

955,ISIS Getting Ebola,"By Isaac Abrak ABUJA, Nov 1 (Reuters) - A man claiming to be Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said more than 200 girls kidnapped by the group six months ago had been ""married off"" to its fighters, contradicting Nigerian government claims they would soon be freed. Nigeria's military says it killed Shekau a year ago, and authorities said in September that they had also killed an imposter posting as him in videos. In the latest recording it is hard to see the man's face as he his filmed from a distance. But it is likely to raise grave doubts about whether talks between a Boko Haram faction and the government in neighboring Chad will secure the release of the girls, who were kidnapped from a secondary school in Chibok, northeast Nigeria, in April. ""We have have married them off and they are all in their husbands' houses,"" the man claiming to be Shekau says. ""The over 200 Chibok girls have converted to Islam, which they confess is the best religion. Either their parents accept this and convert too or they can die."" The majority of the kidnapped girls were Christians. The man in the video also denied there was a ceasefire, and denounced Ahmadu, who says he represents Boko Haram in Chad. ""Who says we are dialoguing or discussing with anybody? Are you talking to yourselves? We don't know anybody by the name of Danladi. If we meet him now we will cut off his head,"" the man in the video says. ""All we are doing is slaughtering people with machetes and shooting people with guns ... War is what we want."" He says also that they are holding a ""white man."" The only known hostage seized in the northeast is a German teacher kidnapped from a college in the northeastern city of Gombe in July by gunmen widely assumed to be linked to Boko Haram. Shekau's denial of the ceasefire appears supported by the violence since the government announced it two weeks ago. It also raises doubts about the actual influence of Ahmadu. The five-year-old campaign for an Islamic state by Boko Haram, which has killed thousands and whose name means ""Western education is sinful,"" has become by far the biggest menace to the security of Africa's biggest economy and top oil producer. Its fighters have attacked targets almost every day for weeks and last week seized control of Mubi, the home town of Nigeria's defense chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh. It was Badeh who announced the ceasefire. They robbed banks, burned down houses and hoisted their black flag over the Emir's palace, killing dozens of people and forcing thousands to flee, witnesses in Mubi said. A car bomb thought to have been planted by Boko Haram killed at least 10 people at a crowded bus stop in Gombe on Friday morning, emergency services said. The government has blamed the violence on Boko Haram's allied criminal networks that it cannot control. There are also thought to be several competing factions within the group.

956,BREAKING: ISIS USES CHEMICAL WEAPONS – Murders 300 Iraqi Soldiers in Chlorine Gas Attack,"BALAD, Iraq — Dizzy, vomiting and struggling to breathe, 11 Iraqi police officers were rushed to a government hospital 50 miles north of the capital last month. The diagnosis: poisoning by chlorine gas. The perpetrators, according to the officers: Islamic State extremists.

The chlorine attack appears to be the first confirmed use of chemical weapons by the Islamic State on the battlefield. An Iraqi Defense Ministry official corroborated it, and doctors said survivors’ symptoms were consistent with chlorine poisoning.

It is one of three crude chlorine attacks that Iraqi forces say have occurred since the extremists seized vast tracts of Iraqi territory this summer, although details on the other two incidents remain sketchy. The reported assaults raise concerns that the militants are attempting to hone their chemical weapons capabilities as they push to seize more ground.

The presence of a large former Iraqi chemical weapons production plant in territory seized by the Islamic State has compounded those fears, though officials and chemical weapons experts say the 2,500 degraded rockets filled with nerve agents that remain there are unlikely to be fit for use. Weapons inspectors sealed them off with concrete in a bunker more than 20 years ago.

The Islamic State’s reported chlorine attacks appear to have been largely ineffectual. The attack on the police officers last month is the only one officially documented.

Chlorine, a common component in industry, is sold legally, but its use as a weapon violates the Chemical Weapons Convention. It was widely employed in trench warfare during World War I, including infamously at Ypres in Belgium, where German forces dispersed more than 160 tons of chlorine into the breeze, killing thousands of French and Allied soldiers.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said last month that chlorine gas has been used “systematically” as a weapon in villages in northern Syria. The U.S. government has blamed those attacks on the Syrian government. But it has been years since the chemical has been used in fighting in Iraq.

It was 4:20 p.m. on Sept. 15 when the 11 police officers were rushed into the hospital emergency room in Balad. Some struggled to stand; tears streamed from their eyes.

“They were panicked; we were panicked,” said Kasim Hatim, the hospital’s director. “We initially thought it might be a more serious gas, a nerve gas or an organophosphate.”

The men had been brought in from the front lines of the nearby town of Duluiyah. Tucked into a bend of the Tigris River, the town had been under heavy assault for days, according to the accounts of three survivors. Islamic State fighters had taken territory to the north, cutting the only direct land access to the river town, and had blown up the last bridge into the town.

The police officers, all members of the Sunni Jabbour tribe, which has turned against the Islamic State, were guarding a line in the town’s north. After an exchange of fire, they said, they were surprised to see Islamic State fighters retreating from their position about 150 yards away.

Suddenly there was a boom in the area the extremists had just vacated, said Lt. Khairalla al-Jabbouri, 31, one of the survivors. “It was a strange explosion. We saw a yellow smoke in the sky,” he said. The wind carried the fog toward their lines. The men say it hung close to the ground, consistent with the properties of chlorine gas, which is heavier than air.

“I felt suffocated,” Jabbouri recalled. “I was throwing up and couldn’t breathe.”

Another officer, Ammer Jassim Mohammed, 31, who suffers from asthma, said he passed out within minutes.

The men were taken to a small clinic in Duluiyah, before being transferred by boat to the larger hospital in Balad, where they were treated with oxygen and hydrocortisone, an anti-inflammatory medication, until the symptoms began to subside. They were all discharged the following morning.

The four physicians who treated them said there was no question that chlorine gas was to blame.

One physician on the team, Hassanain Mohammed, had treated similar cases before. In 2006 and 2007, al-Qaeda in Iraq, a group that later morphed into the Islamic State, carried out a string of chlorine bombings in the country.

Mohammed was on duty at a Baghdad hospital one day during that period when dozens of victims were brought in after a bombing in Taji district, just north of the capital, in which insurgents had packed a truck with explosives and two one-ton chlorine tanks.

There have been no confirmed accounts of the use of chlorine gas as a weapon in Iraq since then.

An Iraqi Defense Ministry official confirmed this week that a bomb rigged with chlorine canisters was used in the Duluiyah attack.

“They use it just to create terror,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to provide the information publicly. “But of course we are very concerned.”

In a statement, the Defense Ministry confirmed that the Islamic State has used the gas in a “primitive and ineffective way” near water treatment plants where it has gained access to chlorine, as well as in roadside bomb attacks. It did not specify the locations of the attacks, but there are several water plants near Duluiyah on territory controlled by the Islamic State.

The extremist group aims to dent “the morale of the Iraqi people in general and our armed forces in particular,” the statement said.

It said that soldiers should be provided with gas masks as a precaution and that volunteers and civilians should place a dampened cloth over the nose and mouth to protect themselves during any attacks.

The defense official said he did not have details of any incidents other than the Sept. 15 attack, while a U.S. official said he had no reports of the use of chlorine by the Islamic State.

“We aren’t aware of any chlorine attacks against the [Iraqi security forces] but would refer you to the Iraqi government to see what they might have,” said Army Maj. Curtis Kellogg, a spokesman for Florida-based U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for U.S. security interests in the Middle East.

Chlorine bombs are an easy-to-create but inexact weapon, experts say. All that is needed is a small explosive charge to rupture containers filled with the substance.

“It’s difficult to deliver on target in combat situations,” said Jean Pascal Zanders, an independent researcher who specializes in chemical and biological weapons and disarmament. “Chlorine dissipates fast unless someone is able to concentrate it in a confined area.”

Fighters in Duluiyah say it was not the only time chlorine has been used against them. Another attack this month caused minor injuries, and the fighters were treated locally, police officials said.

Immediately after the September attack, the Balad hospital put in orders for thousands of doses of atropine, used to treat nerve-gas exposure, Hatim said. A thousand have been shipped across the river to Duluiyah.

Soldiers who escaped an Islamic State rout of a besieged army base in Saqlawiyah, where hundreds of soldiers were killed last month, also said chlorine gas was used there — though reports of where and how the gas was delivered varied and could not be confirmed.

While some officers said air-fired canisters fell short of the base, others, who claimed to have remained in the installation for a longer period, said they fell within its perimeter.

“It was chaos,” said Capt. Ahmed Hussein. He said he believed that gas canisters were fired into the camp but pointed out that the situation was highly confused. “I saw an explosion and smelled the smell; it was like bleach,” he said. “I was far enough away, but others were affected and were left behind.”

Ammar Toma, a member of parliament’s defense and security committee, said it had received photographs from officers of the projectiles used in the Saqlawiyah area.

“We aren’t sure chlorine was used,” he said. “But we believe it was either chlorine or another chemical.”

957,"Elon University has not banned the term ‘freshman,’ despite rumors","His voice served as a call to action, an echo that continues today whenever a kid bellows the word “hip hop” into a microphone. It was in Henry “Big Bank Hank” Jackson’s lyrical wobble, the way he rapped through the Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight,” the singular hit that propelled a movement when it was released in 1979.

Jackson, 57, died Tuesday morning after complications from cancer, but his influence remains.

The news was confirmed by David Mallie, the business manager for the two surviving members of the original Sugarhill Gang, Guy “Master Gee” O’Brien and “Wonder Mike” Wright.

Hank was introducing a flow that in the decades to come would move through culture one boasted rhyme at a time.
-  
“They say that miracles never cease, I’ve created a devastating masterpiece,” rapped Big Bank Hank on “Rapper’s Delight,” a boast that codified one of rap’s central themes -- self-aggrandizement. Little did he know at the time how accurate he was, and that through said devastation Hank was introducing a flow that in the decades to come would move through culture one boasted rhyme at a time.

As seen on a widely circulating YouTube clip in performance on a local dance show, Big Bank Hank performs with a violet Kangol-style hat and a too-tight T-shirt. The hearty emcee grooves as he rhymes (lip-synced though it may be), lost in music with a fluid pelvic wobble. Next to the more restrained Wonder Mike and Master Gee, he is rap-funk personified. Hank embodies his verse as he raps of out-lasting Superman with a funny line belittling the superhero’s manhood. It's no match for Hank’s “super sperm.”

“I’m here, I’m there, I’m Big Bank Hank, everywhere,” he raps. Again, he had no idea how true that was, though he witnessed the music's evolution over the following decades as the hip-hop style he helped popularize become a form as vital to the ever-evolving story of American music as jazz and country and western.

This line, from the same verse, part of a larger bit involving a sexy reporter, further underscores his import: “She said she’s heard stories and she’s heard fables/That I’m vicious on the mike and the turntables.” That little turn of phrase carved into wax rap’s ongoing love-affair with turntables and microphones.

In the formative “Apache,” the Gang harnessed the titular brass and bongo breakbeat while they shouted, “Tonto, jump on it! Kemosabe, jump on it!” Big Bank Hank then made another claim: “I’m the one who shot Jesse James!”

To call the Sugarhill Gang the “big bang” of hip-hop diminishes the contributions of an entire community that imagined the music at its inception. Big Bank Hank, after all, got his start in the business as a bouncer and managing an act that would become the Cold Crush Brothers. He landed a spot in the Sugarhill Gang when the late music executive Sylvia Robinson tapped him to be part of a pop-oriented rap trio she was putting together.

Jeff Chang’s essential history of hip hop, “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop,” describes the song as standing out amid party-oriented rap of the time due to the group’s birth as a studio creation.


Writes Chang, “Their raps on ‘Rapper’s Delight’ were the stuff that sounded good not in the parties, but on the live bootleg cassettes playing in the OJ cabs and on the boom-boxes --- the funny stories, the hookish slang, the same kind of stuff that would strike listeners around the world as both universal and new, not local and insular.”

“Rapper’s Delight” is considered the best selling 12-inch single of all time, though that’s tough to confirm in the pre-Soundscan era, which began in 1991 (and various litigation involving the track’s unapproved sampling of Chic’s “Good Times” further blurred the issue of numbers).

As happened with most first-generation rap teams (and second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-), Sugarhill Gang failed to sustain a bankable post-hit career, and didn’t receive royalty checks equal to its influence. In the years following the track's success, the style morphed in dozens of different directions, though, becoming politicized through Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, electro-fied through Afrika Bambaataa and popularized through Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys. 

Reverse engineer virtually any rap song since, and the circuitry leads back to ""Rapper's Delight,"" and by extension, Big Bank Hank. His phrasing, his fluid, funky tone, has endured, passed down from rapper to rapper, an invisible but essential presence.

958,"Rare Case: Seven Bosnian Girls, Aged 13 And 14, Fall Pregnant After Five-Day School Trip; Parents Outraged After School Cites 'Parental Neglect'","KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Kansas City health officials said a man held in isolation at a local hospital over the weekend was not infected with the Ebola virus. Officials hope to sooth nerves as fears about the deadly virus spread across the country, even though the virus itself has not.

“We have ruled out any Ebola case in Kansas City,” Kansas City Health Department Director Dr. Rex Archer told reporters on Monday. He said the man, who had recently traveled to Nigeria, did not possess the symptom profile for the deadly virus beyond a high fever and had not been in direct contact with anyone who had the disease during his travels.

No Ebola blood test was done, Dr. Archer said, because the feared symptoms never materialized.

The case marked the second known Ebola scare in the Kansas City area , as fears of the virus have built while an American fights for his life against it in Dallas.

At the White House Monday, President Barack Obama urged calm and outlined several steps the administration is taking to contain the virus in Africa and fight it there.

“The CDC is familiar with dealing with infectious diseases and viruses like this,” the president said. “We know what has to be done, and we have the medical infrastructure to do it.”

Monday morning, Kansas Senator Jerry Moran sent a letter to the CDC director , urging greater screening at U.S. ports of entry, including airports.

This afternoon, President Obama said such steps are under consideration.

“We're also going to be looking at protocols to do additional passenger screening both at the source and here in the United States,” Obama said. “All of these things make me confident that here in the United States, the chances of an outbreak-of an epidemic here- are extraordinarily low.”",unrelated

The statement, which circulated on Twitter, said an airstrike outside Raqqa, Syria killed the 26-year-old Mueller. The statement used Mueller’s full name, which had not been public.

The claim could not be immediately confirmed and ISIS did not provide photographic evidence of Mueller’s death, as the group has in the past with other hostages and its own fighters.

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said they have “not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL’s claim,” using an alternate acronym for the terror group.

A Jordanian official told ABC News ISIS's claim was ""illogical"" and was part of the terror group's public relations campaign. ""We need to be very careful not to fall in their trap,"" the official said.

Jordan's Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh, called ISIS's claim ""an old and sick trick.""

""So they behead innocent #US #UK & Japan hostages & BURN a brave #jordan pilot ALIVE & now a hostage is killed by an airstrike? Sure! Sick!"" Judeh said on Twitter, referring to previous atrocities apparently committed on camera by ISIS fighters.

The ISIS statement appeared to contain some discrepancies, including Thursday’s date on accompanying pictures purportedly showing the building that was struck, while the statement claimed the strikes occurred during Friday prayers. ISIS also claimed Mueller was the only person killed in that particular airstrike, with none of its fighters injured or killed.

Officials believe ISIS has misled the public before about the fate of hostages. The Jordanian government said ISIS killed a Jordanian pilot the terror group was holding a month ago, even though the terror group pretended he was alive during hostages negotiations last week.

Mueller, from Prescott, Ariz., was kidnapped Aug. 4, 2013 after leaving a Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, according to information provided by a family spokesperson.

She had graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009 and “has devoted her career to helping those in need in countries around the world,” the family spokesperson said.

Mueller told her town's local newspaper, The Daily Courier, she felt called to help those suffering the most in the midst of the Syrian conflict.

“For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,” she said in the May 2013 report. “[I will not let this be] something we just accept… It’s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.”

In October 2011, Mueller uploaded a video to a Syrian activist YouTube channel in which she said, “I am in solidarity with the Syrian people.”",discuss

961,Report: Nigerian Woman Quarantined in KC with Ebola-Like Symptoms (Video),"Militants with the Islamic State jihadi group have released a video that appears to show the beheading of a British hostage, David Haines, an aid worker who was captured just days after he arrived in Syria last year.

British government officials were seeking to authenticate the video which purported to show the final moments of Haines, who was 44.

In the video, entitled A Message to the Allies of America, a masked man is shown carrying out the beheading of Haines, whose life had earlier been threatened in a film showing the murder of American journalist Steven Sotloff. The video, which runs to two minutes and 28 seconds, ends with a warning that a second British hostage would be the next to die. He has been named in international media and on social media as Alan Henning, a British aid worker.

Haines is the third western hostage and the first Briton to be killed in this fashion by Isis – the first, US journalist James Foley, was murdered in a video released on 19 August.

The British prime minister, David Cameron, issued a statement denouncing the killing. “This is a despicable and appalling murder of an innocent aid worker. It is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal.

“We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.”

Cameron will gather senior representatives of the military and security services and the Foreign Office and Home Office in Whitehall to discuss the situation.

The US president, Barack Obama, also condemned the killing. “The United States strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group Isil,” he said, using his administration’s preferred acronym for Isis. “Our hearts go out to the family of Mr Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom.

“The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve. We will work with the UK and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world.”

The recording features a voiceover delivered by an Isis militant, whose voice and accent closely resembles that of the killer in both the Sotloff and Foley videos. The killer directly addresses Cameron, saying that Haines “has to pay the price for your promise” to arm Kurdish peshmerga fighters against Isis.

Speaking to the camera, the hostage, composed but clearly under duress, and wearing an orange jumpsuit, reads out a statement in which he says that Cameron is “entirely responsible for my execution” for entering into a coalition with the US.

Haines, who was in the Royal Air Force for 12 years before moving into aid work, addresses Cameron, saying: “You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State, just as your predecessor, Tony Blair, did, following a trend amongst our British prime ministers who can’t find the courage to say no to the Americans.

“Unfortunately, it is we, the British public, that will in the end pay the price for our parliament’s selfish decisions.”

The killer, swathed in black, then makes a statement in which he makes a direct reference to the British government’s aid to Kurdish fighters.

He says: “This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State. Ironically, he has spent a decade of his life serving under the same Royal Air Force that is responsible for delivering those arms.

“Your evil alliance with America which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha dam will only accelerate your destruction. And playing the role of the obedient lapdog, Cameron, will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war.”

At the end of the latest video, another hostage, Henning, is paraded.

The US carried out at least nine air strikes last week on Isis militants threatening the Haditha dam. The bombing was cited by Haines’s killer in the video.

A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office in London said: “We are aware of the video and are working urgently to verify the contents.”

Isis had threatened to kill Haines, a father of two, in a video that emerged 11 days ago in which Sotloff was murdered. Less than 24 hours before the latest video emerged, the Haines family had made a plea to the jihadis to respond to their efforts to make contact.

The family statement, which was released by the Foreign Office and addressed the militants directly, said: “We are the family of David Haines. We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.”

Haines was born in East Yorkshire but raised in Perthshire, and before his capture was living in Croatia with his second wife Dragana.

He had a 17-year-old daughter with his first wife Louise, and a four-year-old daughter with Dragana, who has described him as a “fantastic man and father”. He was kidnapped while working for the aid organisation Acted, having previously worked in Libya and South Sudan.

A meeting of the British government’s emergency committee, Cobra, is expected to be called imminently and the prime minister’s attentions will be diverted from the referendum on Scottish independence, due to take place on Thursday.

Haines had worked for aid agencies in some of the world’s worst trouble spots, including Libya and South Sudan.

He was in Libya during its civil war in 2011, working as head of mission for Handicap International, which helps disabled people in poverty and conflict zones around the world.",unrelated

963,Watch: US marine survives Taliban sniper headshot in Afghanistan,"The Department of Homeland Security has received serious and credible information indicating that an extremist splinter group of Al Qaeda, now going by the name Bhakkar Fatwa, is planning multiple attacks against American consumers as they wait in line for stores to open on November 28th: the day known as Black Friday.

Bhakkar Fatwa is a small, relatively unknown group of Islamic militants and fanatics that originated in Bhakkar Pakistan as the central leadership of Al Qaeda disintegrated under the pressures of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and drone strikes conducted around the world. The group has since branched out and begun aggressively recruiting throughout the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Within the last year the group has come under increased scrutiny by both the CIA and the Department of Homeland Security as they have begun actively recruiting on American soil.

Jeh Johnson, Director of the Department of Homeland Security, has referred to Bhakkar Fatwa as the number one growing problem on the domestic terrorism front in America. Their presence is felt in many mosques and islamic centers across the country: always quietly and out of sight, and previously without any violent operations. Officials at both the CIA and Homeland Security think that may be about to change.

Jack Phillips, agent in charge of monitoring Bhakkar Fatwa’s American operation detailed the agencies recent findings. “Working with both the CIA and the NSA we were able to access conversations and communications between members of Bhakkar Fatwa’s domestic organization and their leadership in Pakistan which indicate that several attacks are planned against American citizens at retail operations on the 28th of November”, said Phillips. “The instructions sent from Pakistan detailed a broad plan of attacks using both firearms and homemade explosives against large crowds gathered outside of stores waiting for the sales that have become the hallmark of the day. The leadership of Bhakkar Fatwa views the American religion as one worshiping money and possessions. They commanded these attacks as being against the ‘holiest temples’ that the Americans serve.”

“We have taken several actions based off of this information”, stated Phillips. “We have detained three individuals who were in active communication with Pakistani leadership regarding these planned terror attacks. All three are undergoing interrogation as we speak so that we may hopefully determine the scope and extent of attacks that have been planned. The names of those detained will not be immediately released. They have been deemed enemy combatants and releasing their identities could impact our operational ability at this point. Everything conceivable is being done to unmask and deal with this new threat.”

“If you are going out shopping early on Friday please keep your eyes open”, Phillips advised. ” At this juncture we are unsure as to how great the threat from these attacks is going to be. We are working as quickly as we can to resolve this situations, but this terrorist group is savvy. They utilize a small closed cell structure, and we may not be able to identify all of them in time. I urge all Americans to strongly consider whether the sales are worth the risk. And if you do go out take particular caution while waiting in line for the store to open. Intelligence points to the time spent waiting outside of the store as the time of greatest vulnerability. I am sure we will resolve this issue, but I still recommend taking adequate precautions.”",unrelated
964,No - a Fox News Twitter account isn't responding to tweets on the #FoxNewsFacts hashtag,"A video has emerged with claims that it shows a large, hairy figure walking swiftly through a snowy, wooded area in Russia. Key details about the incident are missing. But the visuals are remarkable.

Watch it here:

According to Mirror online, some Russian adventurers went in search of the elusive Yeti -- that's what many call Bigfoot in Russia -- after reports of creature sightings emerged from a remote region of the southwestern Adygea Republic in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. The map below shows Adygea's capital city of Maykop.

The research team spoke to local residents who said they saw the unusual animal.

The Daily Mail reports that one eyewitness, Ludmila Hristoforova, told a local television station, ""The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we've seen something big and shaggy.""

Another resident, Andrei Kazaryan (who Mysterious Universe suggests was one of the investigators), said, ""I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house. Although we didn't see anyone, we saw its huge footprints.""

The researchers claimed they captured that video footage -- seen above -- of the hairy Yeti. They also made a plaster cast of a large footprint found in the snow.

Both the video footage and the footprint cast are now reportedly in the hands of local scientists. Oddly, the names have not been revealed of those scientists or of the original researchers who say they took the video.

This story brings up other dubious questions:

Why no exact date or time of the alleged video encounter?

Why is it that, after the ""Yeti"" moves quickly through the snow from right to left, seeming to elude the research group as fast as it can, it suddenly stops its forward motion and casually turns to the right, not appearing to be in a hurry, almost as if it/he was waiting for further cinematic direction from those who were doing the videotaping?

This story is hot on the heels of two other Bigfoot tales we've reported on so far in January, including one that set off a huge controversy about a reported Skunk Ape photographed in Tampa, Florida.

There was also the one about how the Arizona Department of Transportation posted an image on its Facebook page, purporting to show ""a family of Sasquatches"" standing in snow next to a highway on Jan. 1. That turned out to be a little joke played on the public by Arizona state transportation officials.

We have a feeling 2015 hasn't seen the last of Bigfoot.

But that's what happened Thursday to one Ann Arbor driver who delivered a single pizza to a conference room full of more than 200 realtors from Michigan and northern Ohio on Thursday.

Pizza House delivery manager Brian LeFevre said he received a call Thursday morning from a man who said they wanted one pizza delivered to the Sheraton Hotel in Ann Arbor.

""They said they wanted it at 2:20 p.m. on the dot,"" LeFevre said. ""I gave it to our delivery driver and he went down there and took it to the front desk.""

A video posted on YouTube shows the deliverer being stopped as he handed over the pizza and then presented with $2,084, letters of encouragement, a Visa gift card and lottery tickets -- all to cheers from the crowd. LeFevre said the driver, who identifies himself as Rob in the video but whose last name wasn't released, has worked at the restaurant about six years.

When he came back, LeFevre said, Rob was visibly happy.

""He was clearly pretty ecstatic about something so I asked him what's going on,"" Le said. ""He said, 'I just had a life-changing delivery.' He was kind of blown away.""

LeFevre said he's never seen a driver earn such a large tip.

968,ISIS fighters 'have contracted Ebola': World Health Organisation investigating reports militants showed up at Iraqi hospital with lethal disease,"With the threat of an ISIS terror attack becoming ever more real, Iraqi media reported yesterday that some of the group’s militants have contracted the deadly Ebola virus, although World Health Organization officials have yet to confirm the reports.

An International Business Times article from today confirms that three Iraqi news outlets reported that Ebola showed up at a hospital in Mosul, a city 250 miles north of Baghdad which has been under ISIS control since June 2014.

Christy Feig, WHO’s director of communications, casted doubt on the report though, telling reporters, “We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.”

On top of that, it isn’t clear whether any disease experts or doctors in Mosul are even able to test for the Ebola virus. A Kurdish official, who was convinced the cases are Ebola, told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants’ symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus.

Nonetheless, Ebola symptoms, like nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding, are also similar to those associated with a number of other diseases, including malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever viruses, and the Marburg virus.

Iraq’s pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, reported that the disease arrived in Mosul from “terrorists” who came “from several countries” in Africa.

According to a Washington Post report, the majority of the ISIS’ African fighters came from Tunisia, while others came from Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan, and Somalia — none of which reported any Ebola cases in 2014.

Benjamin T. Decker, an intelligence analyst with the Levantine Group, said that over the past few weeks, militants affiliated with ISIS have executed more than a dozen doctors in Mosul.

“U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,” he said.

Decker added, “In this context, the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.”",discuss
969,Video Messaging App Says Audio Recording Of Michael Brown's Shooting Is Authentic,"OTTAWA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Canada is trying to confirm reports that a Canadian citizen has been captured in Syria, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Sunday. ""Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels"" to seek further information and is in touch with local authorities, the spokesman said in a statement. Israeli media reports, including Haaretz newspaper quoting a website associated with Islamic State, said a Canadian-Israeli woman, Gil Rosenberg, has been captured. The reports cited jihadist websites and have not been confirmed by Israeli officials. ""I cannot confirm that and I hope that it isn't true,"" Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon told an Israeli television channel when asked about the reports. Rosenberg, 31, told Reuters that she was in Syria in November. A source linked to the YPG, the Kurds' dominant fighting force in northern Syria, said earlier this month that she was their first female foreign recruit and had crossed into Syria to fight Islamic State militants.

970,Is Kim Jong-Un Really Opening a Restaurant in Scotland?,"A 26-year-old woman from Chengdu, in China's southwest Sichuan Province, has taken an unusual approach to mending her broken heart: spending a week inside Kentucky Fried Chicken, gorging on the food.

Tan Shen said that she was ""walking around feeling miserable"" when she passed the KFC restaurant in the city's train station.

She told local media: ""I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings. But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

""I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.""

She telephoned her employers to say that she was sick, and was unable to go to work.

And so she settled in.

After a few days employees at the chicken shop noticed that the same woman was still there.

""We work in shifts here and the restaurant is open 24 hours a day, so we get a lot of people coming through. At first no one really noticed her,"" said Jiang Li Lung, 22.

""But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar. Then I realised we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left.

""When we asked her if she was OK, she said she was and just needed time to think. And then asked for another box of chicken wings with extra large fries.""

Miss Tan decided that it was time to leave the restaurant when, after a week, local media begun to write about her.

So she telephoned her employer, said that she had decided to leave her job, and took a train to her parents home in Quingdao city in east China’s Shandong Province.

""And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore,"" she said.

Jiang Li Lung, who worked at KFC, said the staff now miss her.

This extraordinary video shows the moment a US Marine is shot in the head by a Taliban sniper in Afghanistan - and lives to tell the tale.

The three minute, 12 second clip, filmed from a helmet camera, follows three of the US Navy's elite amphibious infantrymen as they take part in a joint helicopter raid in Now Zad, Helmand Province in 2013.

After hearing insurgent gunfire, the trio go to investigate, pausing for cover in the exit of a tunnel.

It is at this moment that the marksman strikes, a bullet from his high-powered weapon ricocheting off the helmet of the second Marine in the patrol with a loud crack.

After some choice language, the men beat a hasty retreat, warning colleagues that a sharpshooter has them in his sights.

Lucky escape: The Marine's ears are left ringing by the Taliban sniper's bullet

Once they are back under cover, the Marine with the helmet camera says to his lucky colleague: ""Dude, you got shot.

""I saw it hit your Kevlar.

Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Vice founder Shane Smith recently balled out exceptionally hard on a dinner for a group of 12 at the Prime Steakhouse in Las Vegas, racking up a $300,000 check.

A source at Vice told BuzzFeed News that Smith won a sum “well north of that bill” while gambling during his week at the CES conference in Las Vegas, and paid for the dinner on his personal credit card. (A Financial Times report says Smith won $1 million; both the FT and New York Times say there were about 30 people eating on Smith’s dime.)

Smith himself hasn’t commented on the story, which is a pity, because the world needs to know the answer to a crucial question: How can you spend $300,000 on dinner?

Short of a how-to guide from the man himself, or a member of his $2.5 billion digital media empire, we’re left to speculate. So in that spirit, we checked out the menu at Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino.

Prime’s Siberian Sturgeon Caviar with traditional accompaniments was likely a must for Smith’s group. The restaurant lists the item as market price, but Eater Las Vegas has it going for up to $2,500 per pound. A couple pounds of caviar seems reasonable.

ALLEKO/ALLEKO

Mercifully for Smith, Prime doesn’t put its wine list online. But just down the strip at Mario Batali’s Carnevino in the Wynn, a few bottles of Dom Perignon (2003) will run guests $400 each.

Jay L. Clendenin/Los Angeles Times / MCT

But what are we, farmers? Any respectable internet baron is going to spring for a couple of bottles of the best champagne in the house. At Batali’s joint, a 1.5-liter bottle of Boërl & Kroff 1998 will set you back $15,000 each.

Obviously white wine accompanies any good foodie’s fish course. Smith’s crew could have grabbed a couple bottles of the $9,000 Montrachet, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti from 2007. An average year, but sometimes compromise is necessary.

Manakin/Manakin

For the reds, perhaps a couple of vintages on the more reasonable side, like the $5,000 per bottle Sine Qua Non “Just for the Love of It” 2002 Syrah.

974,IPhone 6 users are tearing their hair out,"FEARS have been raised that Islamic militants have seized a dozen commercial aircraft in an attack on a Libyan airport last week. Now, according to a report, intelligence agencies are warning the jets could be used in 9/11-style attacks.

“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” one official told The Washington Free Beacon this morning.

“We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

The report said intelligence reports distributed within the US government over the past few weeks have detailed the types of aircraft believed seized. Several have the size and range to reach deep into Europe and Africa.

The Beacon reports the analysts as issuing a specific warning — that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack on the date marking the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in the United States.

It is also the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi.

The threat warning comes as dramatic video reveals the final moments of a Libyan combat jet.

The aircraft plunged into the ground less than a kilometre from the country’s parliament during a fly-past intended to honour the pilot of another fighter jet that died in a crash a week ago.

The resulting fireball damaged several nearby buildings.

Libya is witnessing its worst violence since former dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi was toppled and killed in 2011.

The country’s divisions are deeply rooted in rivalries between Islamists and non-Islamists, as well as powerful tribal and regional allegiances between groups that quickly filled the power vacuum after Gaddafi’s was ousted. Successive transitional governments have failed to control the militias.

FIGHTING FLARES UP

Fierce clashes have erupted in recent days over Libya’s eastern city of Benghazi.

Fighting between Islamist militiamen and rival forces loyal to a renegade general killed 31 fighters on both sides, a security official said overnight.

The fighting erupted late on Monday, with forces and fighter jets belonging to General Khalifa Hifter pounding positions of Islamist militias called The Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council, said the official.

The issue of foreign military intervention is one of the most debated in the country. Earlier this month, unknown parties carried out air strikes in Tripoli, bombing Islamist-allied militias’ positions. American officials confirmed reports that Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were behind the two air strikes.

The hours-long clashes concentrated around the city’s Benina airport and the militiamen responded with artillery, added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media.

Hifter’s side lost 20 fighters while the militiamen had 11 killed, and 36 fighters in all were wounded, the official said. Several of the wounded were reported to be in critical condition.

Fighting in recent months has mostly engulfed the capital, Tripoli, and also Benghazi, the country’s second-largest city.

The militias in control of the capital, operating under an umbrella group called the Dawn of Libya, have also taken control of the US embassy compound a week after they drove out rival militias.

On Tuesday, Libya’s official news agency said calm had returned to Tripoli, with some banks resuming work and shops and bakeries reopening. Traffic also picked up in the capital and there were long lines outside gas stations. Some families who fled the fighting areas have returned to their homes, the agency said.

POLITICAL CRISIS

On Monday, Libya’s newly elected parliament asked Abdullah al-Thinni — the country’s prime minister who resigned last week — to form a new government. Al-Thinni had said after his resignation that his government had lost control of almost all state institutions and government offices to the armed Islamist militias.

The fighting forced the newly elected parliament and al-Thinni to operate in the eastern city of Tobruk.

On Tuesday, Mohammed Shouaib, the deputy head of parliament, stressed that the body did not ask for “military intervention” but for the United Nations to help Libya build its institutions, including the police and military. He was referring to an earlier decision by the parliament to call for international help in restoring order in Libya.

Shouaib was speaking in a press conference with British envoy Jonathan Powell and British ambassador Michael Aron, who were visiting Tobruk to express support to the elected parliament.

Meanwhile in Tripoli, a parallel government is in the making. Supported by Islamist allies, the so-called National Salvation government led by Omar al-Hassi and his 14-ministers won a vote of confidence. Al-Hassi was appointed by the outgoing parliament — whose mandate expired after a new parliament was elected — and assigned him to form a new government to challenge the legitimate ones in Tobruk.",unrelated

The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.

It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.

A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses.

The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.

Eyewitnesses said an armed man with long black hair emerged at the war memorial, fired about four times‎, and a guard went down. The gunman then ran toward Parliament Hill. The shooting victim was taken to hospital in an ambulance. Police have sealed off the area.

Police locked down Parliament and Ottawa Police tactical officers arrived, pointing guns at journalists and ordering them to the ground. Journalists were put into lockdown at the foyer in front of the House of Commons. Police were warning the public to stay away from Parliament Hill and the war memorial.

Reporters saw a body lying on the floor outside the Library of Parliament.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper “is safe and has left Parliament Hill,” Jason MacDonald, his director of communications, said via Twitter.

Amid the chaos, MPs were among those taking cover. Michelle Rempel, a Conservative MP from Calgary, used Twitter to communicate with the outside world: “Mom im okay Im in hiding.” She also tweeted: “is it clear people? shots were outside caucus room”.

It appears that officers were searching the building. One body was visible outside the library of parliament, roughly in the middle of Centre Block, but it was unclear if that was a suspect or a law enforcement official.

Dylan Thomas, 21, was on holiday with friends when he woke up one morning to find a red, scar-like trail on his stomach.

He was initially given antihistamine cream to treat what doctors in Bali thought was an insect bite. But the red trail spread upwards and by Monday it had started blistering so he was sent to see a dermatologist, who discovered the small tropical spider and removed it.

The doctors said the spider had burrowed through a small scar left by a previous operation to remove his appendix.

Thomas has since returned to his home in Western Australian. He told local media NT News: “It was bigger than the size of a match-head.”

“It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated. It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days” he said.

“WORLDWIDE – NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 6 days of almost complete darkness and will happen from the dates Tuesday the 16 – Monday the 22 in December. The world will remain, during these three days, without sunlight due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight,” it reads in part.

But Huzlers has a disclaimer that says it’s not real and shouldn’t ever be taken seriously.

“Huzlers.com is a combination of real shocking news and satirical entertainment to keep its visitors in a state of disbelier,” the About Us section reads on the bottom of each web page.

But Miss Smith has finally gone public and spoken for the first time about her role in the TV show which featured characters Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po.

Miss Smith only revealed her secret during a game with her university friends - where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

She then used Facebook to confirm it was her - and photos show she still has the same cheeky face.

Miss Smith said: 'I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them. My mother is really chuffed.'

She then made the news public on Facebook.

She wrote: 'So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.

'I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it.

'I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.'

Miss Smith is now a first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University

Miss Smith added: 'Everyone says they can see the likeness between my face now and me as a baby. I still have a baby face. I haven't changed much either. I am still giggly.'

Miss Smith posted a picture of a letter her parents received from Courtyard Productions in Four Elms, Kent, on June 17, 1996, on Facebook proving she was the baby - not the American TV star Jessica Smith.

She said: 'I'm not sure why the actress is claiming to be the face or why people think she is.

'She would have been 10 at the time of filming - and she doesn't even look like the baby.

'My neighbours said I should put everyone right as they would be annoyed if it was them. But I wasn't that bothered until I told my uni friends.

'I am not sure why they picked me - I assume because I was more giggly than everyone else.'

She added: 'I do remember watching the Teletubbies when I was a child.

'When I was young I used to laugh along with the sun but it was only when I got older that I understood it was me.

'My close friends and family knew, but it just never interested me before to tell everyone.

'At uni we had to tell the person sitting next to us something about ourselves so I thought I would say it.

'Then people from uni convinced me to tell everyone and they encouraged me through it all.

'I am proud. I wouldn't change it for anything.

'My family will all remember it for ever. My nan has articles about me when I was baby all over her wall.'

As no one could predict the success of Teletubbies (pictured) Jess was paid £250 and given a box of toys

Her name was put forward when her mother Anji Smith, 44, a recruitment consultant, took her to be weighed at Edenbridge Hospital, Kent.

A health visitor had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies.

Miss Smith was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun.

Her father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.

As no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home.

Delighted Mrs Smith said: 'It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.

Miss Smith (pictured left) with a friend, said she is not disappointed by her small payment of £250

'They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.'

Miss Smith said she is not disappointed by her small payment of £250.

The production company also sent the family a video of her performance and told them when the first show would be aired on TV.

She said: 'I am sure I loved the box of toys.

'No one knew how big the show was going to be so we didn't get offered royalties. '

She added: 'People told my mum that I should have gone into modeling but she thought it wasn't the right move to make as I was quite shy.'

Luckily Jess' little sister Lucy, now 17, hadn't been born when she took part in the filming so there were no arguments over who got the part.

In case you're having deja vu, the WSJ reported exactly the same thing back in March and Amazon firmly denied it. However, the Post confidently said that the offering is now a definite ""go."" One of its sources for the rumor is a potential advertiser, which said Amazon would unveil the service in order to increase its video share against arch-rival Netflix -- and ultimately tempt users into Prime memberships.

Amazon (sort of) offers limited ad-supported streaming now, by letting non-Prime users watch a limited selection of Prime shows with commercial breaks. If the Post's report proves accurate, the launch of a larger ad-supported streaming service may mean that the current version successfully enticed Amazon customers to buy Prime. Amazon recently scored a deal to stream classic HBO programs like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in a minor coup over Netflix. But it still has less than a tenth of its competitor's size -- and we imagine that ""free"" looks pretty good to a lot of users, ads or not. So far Amazon hasn't commented on the matter, but we've reached out for more information.

Update: Amazon told us it has ""not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service."" That doesn't mean that it won't, though, so let us translate that into non-PR-speak for you: ""No comment."" Its full statement is below.

988,"Woman detained in Lebanon is not al-Baghdadi's wife, Iraq says","A lot of folks are buzzing about 17-year-old Stuyvesant High School senior Mohammed ""Mo"" Islam who is rumored to have made $72 million from trading.

New York Magazine's Jessica Pressler profiled him in a recent issue.

But a number of folks who know Islam told Business Insider that they strongly believe that the $72 million figure is just a rumor - a rumor that Islam hasn't denied.

In the article, he acknowledged to Pressler over caviar and apple juice that his net worth was in the ""high eight figures.""

A source familiar with the story told Business Insider that Islam is not worth $72 million. The source believes it's a rumor started by Islam's friends or partners that was perpetuated by the New York Magazine article.

Pressler has also defended the story. She Tweeted that she saw a bank statement with the eight figures and is comfortable with what's in the piece. She also Tweeted that New York Magazine ""is not a financial publication.""

Business Insider actually featured Islam on our list of ""20 Under 20"" in finance just over a year ago. He was nominated by his peers.

In a phone interview on Monday Islam's partner Damir Tulemagabetov, who was also in the New York Magazine article, said the $72 million figure isn't necessarily completely accurate.

""Let me put it this way...it's stated as a rumor,"" Tulemaganbetov told us when we asked him if he would deny the $72 million figure. He was with Islam in a car headed to CNBC's studios in New Jersey.

""All the hype, [Islam] deserves it,"" Tulemaganbetov said. Adding that he is ""pretty sure"" Islam is a ""a great trader"" and that he's a ""genius.""

Business Insider asked for audited numbers or P&L statements to prove that Islam's networth is close to $72 million. Tulemaganbetov refused.

Islam himself did not respond to our email this morning requesting the numbers. He also would not get on the phone when Business Insider learned he was riding in the car to CNBC.

The investment club for young traders, of which Islam is a member, sent Business Insider this statement regarding the $72 million figure:

It has been brought to the attention of the Leaders Investment Club that Mohammed Islam has been rumored to have made $72,000,000 through making trades in the stock market. After performing due diligence and talking with Mohammed Islam himself, we have determined that these claims are false and simply been blown up by the media in the interests of sensationalism.

Islam's partner Tulemaganbetov, however, would not be that clear in his coversation with Business Insider.

""We can't just talk about the numbers. It's not just about the money,"" Tulemaganbetov said. ""We're on the verge of a lot of great things in our lives so we can't just focus on providing you the statements. We're on the verge of a lot of great things. We are going to talk to CNBC.""

Again, Business Insider pressed the issue of the P&L statements.

""All those statements...that's good for you. We know what we're doing. We're managing this whole hype and everything. We are trying to work with it. We were never expecting it and never denied. You have no proof.""

Tulemaganbetov told us that Islam didn't expect all the attention. He just expected a magazine article.

""The guy became famous all over the world in 24 hours. He's all over the world. The next thing we wake up and he's famous. This guy is a celebrity all over the world right now.""

Tulemaganbetov told us that they were going to ""make it clear on CNBC.""

ISIS sympathisers took to social media to identify the 'cub fighter' by his alleged nom de guerre Abu Ubaidah, adding that both he and his father were killed during clashes in Syria in recent weeks, but not specifying exactly where they died or who they had been fighting against.

Several images, which have not been independently verified, emerged on social media this week after a video reporting the deaths of the boy and his father was uploaded to YouTube in September.

The original video - distributed by the pro-Isis media group Al-A'amaq - is understood to have since been removed, but a number of photographs of the boy have since been widely shared by ISIS militants and their sympathisers on social media.

One image shows the boy standing inside a house, grinning as he struggles to hold an assault rifle so large that it threatens to topple him over.

Another picture shows him smiling sweetly while wearing an ammunition vest as he stands next to a van that has been converted into an armoured vehicle with a large plank of wood and bull bars.

Other images show him posing with a man understood to be his father, who militants named as 'Baghdadi'. In those images the boy identified as Abu Ubaidah is seen calmly holding another large rifle while surrounded by bearded men wearing military clothing.

Last week a 24-year-old Muslim convert admitted taking her infant son to live among Islamic State terrorists in the Syrian city of Raqqa because she believes he will lead a 'better life' under their brutal regime.

Asiya Ummi Abdullah denied that children are unhappy living under the oppressive rule of ISIS' religious fanatics and explained that she felt her three-year-old son's spiritual well-being was better served in the group's de facto capital, where public crucifixions and beheadings are commonplace.

Ummi Abduallah - who had lived in Turkey since her teens but was born in Kyrgyzstan - said moving to the militant stronghold in Syria was in part to shield the young boy from the sex, crime, drugs and alcohol she sees as rampant in her home town Istanbul.

'Who says children here are unhappy?... He will know God and live under his rules,' she said.

Dramatic footage has emerged from inside Kobane showing brave Kurdish fighters battling against militants from the Islamic State.

The clip, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, shows resistance forces from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) firing assault rifles and machine guns mounted on the back of a car at militants hiding behind buildings in the Kobane suburbs.

The terrorists launched a renewed assault on Kobane last night, killing dozens of Kurds who have resisted ISIS' advances into the city's suburbs over the last three weeks.

Prepared: A Kurdish fighter takes up his position to fight the Islamic State jihadists

Islamic State militants are now in control of one third of the besieged Syrian city of Kobane despite three days of American airstrikes, a group monitoring violence in the country said today.

This morning the chilling sight of the group's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes.

While the airstrikes appear to have slowed the militants advance in some areas of the city, ISIS fighters appear to be creeping ever closer to the centre of Kobane, where thousands of civilians unable or unwilling to flee their homes face rape and massacre.

News of ISIS' gains came as the Pentagon admitted airstrikes alone will not be enough to prevent the fall of Kobane, raising serious questions over the U.S.'s wider campaign against the terror group.

Still flying: This morning the chilling sight of the group's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes

Dramatic: The escalation in Kobane has seen the U.S. and Arab coalition carry out the most sustained period of bombing raids since their campaign to destroy the Islamic State in northern Syria started two weeks ago

Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said airstrikes are 'not going to be enough to save that city', amid growing concern that without Western ground troops being sent into Syria, the defeat of ISIS will prove a near impossible task.

Heavily outgunned Kurdish defenders said Islamic State militants had pushed into two districts of Kobane - a mainly Kurdish border city with 40,000 residents - by late last night.

Washington said the U.S. military and Arab partner nations responded to ISIS renewed assault by carrying out eight air strikes last night, adding that for now the city remains under Kurdish control.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights this morning said that despite overnight airstrikes, which have continued into this morning, Islamic State fighters managed to capture a police station in the east of Kobane and now control one third of the city.",unrelated
990,Newly-Found Document Holds Eyewitness Account of Jesus Performing Miracle,"A ceasefire agreement between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government was expected to lead to the liberation of more than 200 school girls kidnapped by the militants six months ago. That was not the case.
 
At least 25 suspected Boko Haram militants were killed as they battled with Nigerian soldiers on Monday, following a ceasefire between the Nigerian government and Islamists in the lawless northern region.
An army officer, speaking anonymously, said the militants tried to enter the town of Damboa late on Sunday through Alagarno, a Boko Haram hideout, but that soldiers had fought them off.
""Our men gunned down 25 of the insurgents because they would have entered Damboa and unleashed more terror on the town that is just picking up from its ruins,"" the officer said.
Damboa, near the border with Cameroon, has been the site of fierce fighting between the militants and Nigerian forces for months. The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by a military counter-offensive.
Ceasefire 'incomplete'
The Borno Elders Forum, made up of retired Nigerian civilian and military officials from the Borno state, said attacks in recent days indicated that not all Boko Haram fighters were aware of the deal.
""I don't think they would continue attacking innocent people if they are aware and they are in agreement that there is a ceasefire,"" said spokesman Bulama Mali Gubio.
The Borno Elders Forum, which last month warned that Boko Haram was preparing preparing to take over key sites in Borno, suggested the government had not negotiated with the entire group.
""If the federal government does not know who the real Boko Haram is, I think they should come here to find out from us,"" Gubio said.
""The real Boko Haram who are killing us, who are burning our towns and villages, are not the Boko Haram that a peace deal was reached with.""
The government claimed a deal was reached after talks in Chad, which included provisions for the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped from the Borno town of Chibok in April.

991,"Video showing American journalist beheaded believed real, officials and family say","THIS is the terrible moment a desperately poor young woman tries to sell her son – to fund life-saving treatment for her daughter.

Mum Meng Xiangyan faced a real-life Sophie's Choice when poverty forced her to decide between her twins.

The distraught 29-year-old said that she and her husband loved both of their children.

But with certain death awaiting their daughter unless they could get medical treatment, they were prepared to sell their son to a good home so that both would have a chance of life.

Pictures published in local media show her standing on Weihai Road in Qingdao, which is a major city in eastern Shandong Province, Eastern China, with a placard offering to sell him to the highest bidder.

He was eating what appeared to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appealed for someone to come forward and buy the boy.

She said: ""Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

""But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukaemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives. It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.""

Medics say that the child is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital.

The family have sold up their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10 square metre flat close to where the therapies are being carried out. The parents are also struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal.

So far, there have been no offers on their son, who has not been named.

Their desperation follows on from a similar recent story in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband, Zhou Xinggui, are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter.

992,"Boko Haram agrees to ceasefire, release of school girls","Claim: Eleven passenger planes are missing from an airport in Libya.

PROBABLY FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, September 2014]

Seeking truth in stir of 11 missing / stolen commercial airliners from the Libyan airport during the fall of Tripoli.

Origins: In early August 2014, some North African bloggers began to spread stories that several commercial airliners were missing from the Tripoli International Airport during or shortly after the facility was taken over by Zintan militia forces earlier in the summer. Later that month translations of the blog posts began to be picked up by news outlets in Western Europe and passed on as fact rather than gossip; by early September those tales of translations of blogs had spread to the United States under the guise of real news.

The use of airplanes as terrorist weapons in 2001 makes it all too easy for us to anticipate their being used that way again. And despite denials from all sides — the airlines who are not missing any planes, the Libyan transport ministry, and the anti-government forces in control of the airport — the tales have found a ready audience among a populace already on edge in anticipation of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

However, there have been no statements from the State Department, the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, or any other authority warning of stolen airliners. The national threat level has not been raised. Algerian and Moroccan military and air defense, already on high alert due to the unrest just across their borders with Libya, would undoubtedly have noticed multiple flights of unidentified passenger aircraft.

993,"Sorry, Fido. Pope Francis did NOT say our pets are going to heaven","14.3K 3077reddit70  32

(RNS) When Pope Francis recently sought to comfort a distraught boy whose dog had died, the pontiff took the sort of pastoral approach he is famous for — telling the youngster not to worry, that he would one day see his pet in heaven.

“Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures,” Francis said reassuringly.

It was a sparkling moment on a rainy November day, and the setting in St. Peter’s Square only burnished Francis’ reputation as a kindly “people’s pope.” The story naturally lit up social media, became instant promotional material for vegetarians and animal rights groups, and on Friday even made it to the front page of The New York Times.

There’s only one problem: apparently none of it ever happened.

Yes, a version of that quotation was uttered by a pope, but it was said decades ago by Paul VI, who died in 1978. There is no evidence that Francis repeated the words during his public audience on Nov. 26, as has been widely reported, nor was there was a boy mourning his dead dog.

So how could such a fable so quickly become taken as fact?

Part of the answer may be the topic of the pope’s talk to the crowd that day, which centered on the End Times and the transformation of all creation into a “new heaven” and a “new earth.” Citing St. Paul in the New Testament, Francis said that is not “the annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us, but the bringing of all things into the fullness of being.”

The trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an Italian news report that extended Francis’ discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to heaven.

“One day we will see our pets in the eternity of Christ,” the report quoted Paul VI as telling a disconsolate boy years ago.

The story was titled, somewhat misleadingly: “Paradise for animals? The Pope doesn’t rule it out.” It wasn’t clear which pope the writer meant, however.

The next day, Nov. 27, a story in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera by veteran Vaticanista Gian Guido Vecchi pushed the headline further: “The Pope and pets: “Paradise is open to all creatures.”

Vecchi faithfully recounted the pope’s talk about a new creation, and also cited Paul VI’s remark.

But the headline put those words in Francis’ mouth, and that became the story.

The Italian version of the Huffington Post picked it up next and ran an article quoting Francis as saying “We will go to heaven with the animals” and contending that the pope was quoting St. Paul – not Pope Paul – as making that statement to console a boy who lost his dog. (That story, by the way, is nowhere in the Bible.)

The urban legend became unstoppable a week later when it was translated into English and picked up by the British press, which cited St. Paul as saying that “One day we will see our animals again in (the) eternity of Christ,” while it has Francis adding the phrase: “Paradise is open to all God’s creatures.”

Fueling the meme was the fact that Francis was photographed accepting a gift of two donkeys from a company promoting the use of donkey milk for infants allergic to cow’s milk – and Francis said his own mother gave him donkey’s milk as a baby.

Social media and other media outlets then picked up the story, further conflating the statements and the chronology. It became a hot mess of a story that was also sparking another theological debate by a pope who was known for prompting controversy.

The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets, paradise, and Pope Francis.

The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets, paradise, and Pope Francis.
When The New York Times went with the story, along with input from ethicists and theologians, it became gospel truth.

Television programs discussed the pope’s theological breakthrough, news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals, and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the afterlife. At America magazine, the Rev. James Martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of Francis’ statements and what level of authority they may have. It was all very interesting and illuminating, but based on a misunderstanding.

A number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train wreck:

The story had so much going for it: Francis took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and sisters.
Pope Francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment, and almost since the day he was elected in 2013 he has stressed the Christian duty to care for creation.
Francis also blessed a blind man’s guide dog shortly after he was elected, an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for animals.
Moreover, the media and the public are so primed for Francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out; it fit with the pattern.
In most accounts, Francis’ comments were also set against statements by his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who insisted that animals did not have souls. That apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative Benedict against the ostensibly liberal Francis.

That may be true in some areas, but probably not when it comes to animals.

Adding insult to injury, the Times article cited St. John Paul II as saying in 1990 that animals have souls and are “as near to God as men are.” But that, too, was a misquote, as media critic Dawn Eden explained at the website GetReligion.

On the other hand, there should have been warnings signs: Francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people, and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go hungry.

In addition, the pope’s huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of myth-making: news reports last year said that Francis was sneaking out of the Vatican at night to feed the homeless around Rome.

The pope personally debunked that rumor in an interview last March, saying the idea “has never crossed my mind” and that “depicting the pope to be a sort of superman, a type of star, seems offensive to me.”

Maybe he’ll have to give another interview to deflate this latest story, and to offer his real thoughts on pets and paradise.

994,Islamic State releases video apparently showing the beheading of missing US journalist James Foley,"Following the deadly shootings at Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine with a history of lampooning religious extremism, cartoonists came out in droves to support those who were killed Wednesday in the best way they knew how: with their own set of tribute cartoons. Artists from The Independent, The Washington Post, and more published visual depictions of their reaction to the news of the attack, which took the lives of 12 people, a death toll that included four prominent cartoonists. (Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier was perhaps the most high-profile of those killed Wednesday.) And — for those who flocked to Facebook, Instagram, and other forms of social media Wednesday — it appeared that Banksy had dedicated his own cartoon to the tragedy. But, come Wednesday night, fans of the elusive street artist would be disappointed to learn that, no, Banksy likely did not draw the stunning pencil image.  

Though it at first appeared as though the artist was responsible for the cartoon after it surfaced on a Banksy Instagram account, it’s believed that the account does not belong to Banksy himself. Not only because Banksy’s official website insists that the artist keeps off social media — specifically referencing his lack of a Facebook or Twitter account (this short-lived Instagram was the only account that was ever linked to Banksy) — but also, as Business Insider notes, the cartoon image is far too low-res for an artist with Banksy’s notoriety. Writes the site:

Another clue that points to the image being fake is its file size. The image uploaded to the fake Banksy social media posts is pixelated and low-resolution. Banksy is an artist who makes a living from exhibiting his work, he wouldn’t want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad.
That said, the image itself is striking, and a fitting tribute to those who have passed on following the shootings in Paris. So, though it’s possible Banksy did not design the cartoon (and only leaves you wondering what kind of tribute Banksy would publish), it’s worth digesting, appreciating, and using it to remember that violence will never quell freedom of speech.",unrelated
995,Weather Channel’s Mike Seidel was not caught with his pants down,"New York (CNN) -- When war reporter James Foley wasn't writing for GlobalPost or recording video for AFP or appearing on the PBS ""NewsHour,"" he occasionally shared stories on his own blog, aptly titled ""A World of Troubles.""

For a subtitle, he chose the famous Carl von Clausewitz sentence ""War is fought by human beings.""

And that is exactly what Foley sought to show with his reporting: humanity amid the horror of war.

Foley was abducted while on a reporting trip in northern Syria in November 2012. He was never heard from again.

A video published Tuesday by the extremist group ISIS showed Foley being beheaded. It is not known when or where the video was recorded.

For Foley's family and friends, the recording was the answer they hoped they'd never hear to their questions about his disappearance.

""We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,"" his mother, Diane, said Tuesday night,

She called him ""an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person.""

Courageous, generous

Foley was the oldest child of Diane and John Foley of Rochester, New Hampshire. He had four siblings.

Foley -- Jim to his friends -- had been reporting from war-torn countries for the better part of four years when he disappeared in Syria.

On Tuesday, fellow journalists remembered him for his courage and his generosity.

One of his friends, Alex Sherman of Bloomberg News, wrote on Twitter that he was a ""funny, warm, Big Lebowski-loving guy.""

Another friend, Max Fisher of Vox, praised his ""dedication to truth and understanding.""

Fisher also wrote that ""Jim's faith was something we all agreed not to discuss publicly while he was held in Syria, but it was the wellspring of his generosity,""

He recalled how Foley helped to organize a memorial fund for a photographer, Anton Hammerl, who was killed in Libya in 2011.

Foley had been traveling with Hammerl and two other journalists at the time, and the three who survived wound up in a Libyan jail.

Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors

Front-line journalist

Foley was freed six weeks later. Afterward, in a video interview with the Boston Globe, he hesitated to make the story about himself, remarking at one point that ""you don't want to be defined as 'that guy who got captured in 2011.'""

""I believe that front-line journalism is important, you know -- without these photos and videos and first-hand experience, we can't really tell the world how bad it might be,"" he said.

One of the journalists detained with Foley in Libya, Clare Morgana Gillis, said his fundraising for Hammerl's family was ""the same impulse that compelled him to cut short his much-needed break from reporting in Syria when a colleague went missing last summer, and to raise money for an ambulance for Aleppo's Dar al-Shifa field hospital, where he spent weeks filming the plight of doctors who struggled to save lives with minimal space equipment.""

His time as a teacher

For Foley, these were acts of service, not entirely unlike his time spent in the Teach for America program. He began teaching in Phoenix in 1996.

""He'd promise students that he'd take them to the Castles and Coasters amusement park if they would come to class everyday,"" a fellow Teach for America alum, Sarah Fang, recalled in an essay in 2013.

Foley later ""taught reading and writing to inmates at the Cook County Sheriff's Boot Camp in Chicago,"" according to a Columbia Journalism Review feature about him.

His journalism career

In the mid-2000s he decided to pursue a journalism career, first by enrolling at Northwestern University's well-respected Medill School of Journalism and then by embedding with American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. While preparing for his first embed, he started his blog.

Foley freelanced for a number of news media outlets, including GlobalPost, a world news Web site founded in 2009.

In 2012, he gravitated toward the spiraling conflict in Syria.

Fang, who kept in touch with Foley after their years teaching in Phoenix, wrote that his interest in the story there did not surprise her.

""He's always been willing to step into a zone where no one else wants to go,"" she wrote. ""Jim feels that society needs reporters willing to bear witness and report back the facts of history-in-the-making. And his loyalty to his colleagues meant that he wanted to be there with them on the frontlines.""

BuzzFeed Middle East correspondent Sheera Frenkel said she last saw Foley about a week before his final trip into Syria.

Drinking beers at the lobby of a hotel popular among journalists, they talked, she said, about ""how hard it was to move on from this job, into a life which would allow for marriage and family.""

""He was a generous colleague, never holding back a tip, phone number, or detail that could help, and could spend hours talking over the ins and outs of a story to get it just right,"" Frenkel wrote in an email message.

""Jim was a great journalist, and I think he'd like to be remembered that way, first and foremost.""

After the news of Foley's killing spread on Tuesday, CBS News foreign correspondent Clarissa Ward changed her profile picture on Twitter to a photo of Foley wearing a helmet, a flak jacket and holding up a camera.

This, she said, ""is how I will chose to remember James -- as a brave and tireless journalist with a passion for the Syrian cause.""

996,"NYPD to issue tickets instead of arrest for weed possession, report says","Small-time drug offenders in New York City could soon find themselves on the receiving end of a ticket instead of inside a jail cell if a policy change on low-level marijuana possession is adopted this week. The move would overwhelmingly affect black and Latino residents, who represented 86 percent of marijuana possession arrests in the city this year, according to the Marijuana Arrest Research Project.

Advocates of criminal justice reform applaud the proposal as a step toward softening the long-term consequences of having a minor drug offense on one’s record, but there is a chance that the policy, which New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to announce Monday, could boomerang. The strategy would require anyone caught with a small amount of marijuana – likely to be defined as 25 grams or less – to be issued a court summons instead of being handcuffed, arrested and fingerprinted. But doing so means those summonses would not be subject to prosecutorial review, which would identify if a summons was justified in the first place, legal experts say.

Under the current system, when an arrest is made, the charge becomes a court case reviewed by a prosecutor. A prosecutor could throw out the charge or refuse to prosecute should he or she see any indication that the arresting officer violated due process, such as searching a person’s backpack without probable cause. Prosecutorial reviews “perform a screening function to weed out legally insufficient cases,” Jeffrey Fagan, professor of law at Columbia Law School in New York, told International Business Times. Under the new policy, “that function has now been eclipsed,” he said.

That sentiment was echoed by Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson, who announced earlier this year that he would stop prosecuting small-scale marijuana violations. The Brooklyn DA’s office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases that involved arrest out of 2,526 such cases since July, according to the New York Times. Allowing police officers to write tickets without accountability creates “a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place,” Thompson told the Times. “These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.”

Another possible repercussion of the city’s proposed policy change could be that arrest warrants are later issued for people who miss their court dates, adding possibly thousands of cases to the docket. Some 28,000 people were arrested on minor marijuana charges in 2013; issuing arrest warrants for all the people who fall sick or cannot miss work on the day of their summonses would put more stress on an already overburdened system. “It’s not solving the problem that they’re trying to solve,” Fagan said.

As many states, counties and cities across the country have done at various times over the past several decades, New York decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana in 1977. The law made possession of the drug a ticketable offense and applied to marijuana that was out of public view and was not being smoked. Nevertheless, police have continued to arrest people and charge them with misdemeanors after finding small amounts of marijuana in their pockets or belongings. ""At this point, [not arresting people for weed] wouldn't be progressive; it'd be catching up with the mainstream,"" Gabriel Sayegh, the New York state director of the Drug Policy Alliance, told Vice.",discuss

New digs, big problem: While the US Vogue offices are moving to 1 World Trade Center in New York City, Anna Wintour may not be making the transition anytime soon

Vogue, however, is not scheduled to move into the 1 World Trader Center until the new year, giving ample time for the removal of the rodents.

The staff member told Gawker the most pressing dilemma facing them had to do with fashion: 'A serious concern (laughable but I guess it makes sense) is all the clothing that could get nibbled through.'

The timing of the infestation comes after Vogue created an online campaign advertising their move to the new offices: 'Batten the hatches, lower Manhattan, because we're coming for you.'

She added that even from the very beginning, Vogue was never about pleasing everyone. 'The first celebrity that I put on the cover of Vogue was Madonna, and that was considered completely controversial at the time, too,' she explained.

'It's such a long time ago probably no one remembers, but she was a very controversial figure. Now she's part of the establishment.'

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said on Sunday that a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a ""relatively small"" meteorite that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth"".

Murillo said Nicaragua would ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.

The crater left by the meteorite has a radius of 12 metres and is 5 metres deep, said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it was still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.

February 4th, 2015 | by Barbara Johnson

Boston| A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

Priest who died for 48 minutes says he met God and she’s a woman

We’ve all seen the traditional depictions of God as a cloud-dwelling figure with a flowing mane and a white beard.

But now, a Catholic priest in America has apparently claimed that God is female, after he officially died for 48 minutes following a massive heart attack.

According to an unverified report, Father John Micheal O’Neal, 71, briefly went to heaven and met a ‘warm and comforting’ motherly figure as doctors battled to save his life at Massachusetts General Hospital.


Analysis: Pure fiction. There is no ""Father John Michael O'Neal"" in the Archdiocese of Boston. So says a spokesperson for the Archbishop himself, Cardinal Sean P. O'Malley.

""I believe this could be a hoax story,"" the spokesperson told a writer for the website Metro.co.uk, which had earlier repeated the false story above without verification. The initial report was also duplicated uncritically on dozens of other blogs and websites.

Not only does it revolve around a priest who doesn't exist, the story further claims that Archbishop O'Malley, a real official of the Church, issued a public disavowal of the priest's alleged statements. There is no public record of such a disavowal.

1010,Has Ebola infected Isis militants in Mosul?,"Militants from Islamic State (Isis) claimed to have killed an American journalist long held captive in Syria in retaliation for ongoing US airstrikes against its forces in Iraq.

A propaganda video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man dressed in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Wright Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012.

The masked executioner spoke in English, with what sounded like a British accent, and said that the slaying came in response to the airstrikes ordered by President Barack Obama against Isis 12 days ago.

Isis, whose chief spokesman came under State Department sanctions on Monday, warned of further revenge – including on another man purported to be a captured US journalist, Steven Sotloff – and in the video, the victim was made to read a statement blaming the US for his own murder.

Foley has been missing in Syria since November 2012, where he went to report on the bloody struggle to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. He was initially thought to have been captured by forces loyal to the Assad regime.

A Facebook message from a support group, Free James Foley, urged patience “until we all have more information,” and asked that readers “keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

YouTube took down the gruesome video, but not before it sparked a debate on social media about the ethics of sharing it, adding a metatextual debate to a depiction of a man’s violent death.

Foley, 40, a former Stars and Stripes reporter, was captured in November 2012 near the Syrian town of Taftanaz. It was not his first detention while reporting: in 2011, he was taken while reporting on the uprising against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi’s forces ultimately released him after six weeks in captivity.

A friend of Foley’s and his fellow captive in Libya, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote in a 2013 essay that captivity was “the state most violently opposite his nature.” Gillis described Foley as gentle, friendly, courageous and impatient with “anything that slows his forward momentum.”

In a January 2013 interview with local television news near her Rochester, New Hampshire home, Foley’s mother Diane said her son was “passionate about covering the story in Syria, passionate about the people there.”

Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said US intelligence was working to determine the authenticity of the video.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said in a statement.

Messages left with the Foley family were not returned.

A day after Obama declared that Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US warplanes had broken Isis’ hold on the critical Mosul Dam, US Central Command announced two strikes near it on Monday, to “further expand control of the area.” One strike was said to have destroyed an Isis checkpoint while the other was “not successful.”

Obama has offered no timeframe for the length of his campaign against Isis. The US military has bombed over 90 targets attributed to Isis, including vehicle convoys, mobile artillery and fixed positions, since 8 August. Most of the strikes have come in the past few days, near the dam. The other strikes have occurred either to blunt an Isis advance on the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil or to lift an Isis siege on Mount Sinjar, where it chased thousands of Iraqi Yazidis whom it threatened to kill unless they converted to Islam.

1011,Saudis Say Michelle Obama Not Blurred on TV,"HAVANA (AP) — Social media around the world have been flooded with rumors of Fidel Castro's death, but there was no sign Friday that the reports were true, even if the 88-year-old former Cuban leader has not been seen in public for months.

Similar speculation has swept across Cuban expatriate communities repeatedly over the decades, particularly after a serious illness forced him to step down from duties as president in 2006, handing over leadership to his younger brother Raul.

The new wave was prompted in part by Fidel Castro's failure to comment after the U.S. and Cuba declared on Dec. 17 that they would move to restore full diplomatic relations broken a half century ago.

The chatter appeared to pick up when some media noted Thursday that Castro had not been seen in public in a year. He last appeared on Jan. 8, 2014, at an art exhibition in Havana, ending nine months out of public view.

The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Aug. 21. He was also photographed with the Chinese and Russian presidents in July. Castrowas last heard from on Oct. 18, when he published an editorial about Ebola.

By Friday, Cuba-related Twitter accounts were ablaze with speculation, fueled in large part by reports on news websites such as Diario de Cuba and Diario las Americas that Cuba had scheduled a news conference, possibly to discuss Castro's health.

The rumors were further stoked when respected Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported on its website that Castro had died. It quickly pulled the report back, however.

Cuban officials told news media in Havana that no press conference had been called, and there were no obvious signs of official preparations for mourning.

1012,Second person rushed to hospital with Ebola symptoms after contact with 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan,"The Pentagon has confirmed that Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab, was killed in a US air strike earlier this week.

The United States previously said that the strike inside Somalia had targeted Godane, but did not know whether he had been killed.

“We have confirmed that Ahmed Godane, the co-founder of al-Shabaab, has been killed,” said rear admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, describing it as a “major symbolic and operational loss” for the militant group, which aligned itself with al-Qaida.

Al-Shabaab is fighting to topple Somalia’s western-backed government and regularly launches bombings and gun attacks against state targets and civilians. Godane’s death could now lead to an internal power struggle.

On Wednesday US officials had said they were still investigating to see whether the strike on an al-Shabaab encampment had killed Godane, 37, who reportedly trained with the Taliban in Afghanistan.

At least three strikes hit a convoy of al-Shabaab vehicles in southern Somalia on Monday night, according to witnesses and a spokesman for the group who spoke later with the Associated Press. The al-Shabaab representative said that six al-Shabaab fighters had been killed in the strikes.

The air raid came days after African Union (AU) troops and Somali government forces launched “Operation Indian Ocean”, a major offensive aimed at seizing key ports from al-Shabaab and cutting off one of their key sources of revenue: multi-million dollar exports of charcoal. AU forces were targeting Shabaab on several fronts, with Ugandan troops leading the offensives against the main port of Barawe, south of the capital, Mogadishu.

The commander of the AU in Somalia has said the death of Godane would be a “proud and happy moment for all Africa”.

Godane, who has a passion for poetry, seized world attention a year ago with the Westgate mall attack in Nairobi, which left at least 67 dead. He warned Kenya that it would suffer further atrocities unless it withdrew its troops from the AU force in Somalia.

“You cannot withstand a war of attrition inside your own country,” he said in an audio message posted on a website linked to al-Shabaab. “So withdraw all your forces, or be prepared for an abundance of blood that will be spilt in your country.”

Washington has carried out a series of drone missile strikes in the past, including attacks reportedly targeting Godane, but rarely confirms this officially.

Godane took over the leadership of al-Shabaab in 2008 after then chief Adan Hashi Ayro was killed by a US missile strike.

Cupertino has been quiet thus far, but rumors are swirling about a 12-inch MacBook Air refresh, and this isn’t just a spec bump. Apple is reportedly redesigning the iconic laptop to be even thinner with a higher resolution screen.
Sources inside the company who have used the prototype notebook (code named MacBook Stealth) say it will eschew many of the conventional laptop features in the name of advancing design. The current MacBook Air’s taper toward the front edge, which gives them a very slim profile, but there’s still space near the back for the power connector and full-sized USBs. The new Air, however, won’t be thick enough for a USB port. Instead, Apple will start using the new type-c reversible connectors. There also won’t be an SD card slot or a MagSafe power connector–even Apple’s beloved Thunderbolt is taking a hike. USB will do it all.

The 12-inch laptop would be substantially smaller and lighter than the 13-inch model, and even slightly smaller than the 11-inch version. This is thanks to slimmer bezels and a slightly more compact keyboard with less separate between keys. 9to5Mac doesn’t have details on exactly how high the resolution will be, but the current Airs are sitting at 1366 x 768 (11-inch) and 1440 x 900 (13-inch). Stepping it up to a Retina Display resolution of 2560 x 1600 (like the 13-inch Pro) would be amazing in the Air’s form factor.

To be clear, all the images of this supposed notebook are renders created by 9to5Mac. This is still thoroughly in the rumor category, but it’s a redesign we’ve been expecting for a long time. The updated MacBook Air could be announced in mid-2015.

1014,ISIS Border Crisis: DHS Chief Says Terrorists Not Entering US Through Mexico,"Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says Islamic State militants are not entering the U.S. through the southern border. Johnson was responding to a claim made by Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., that at least 10 Islamic State operatives were detained trying to come in from Mexico.

“We have no credible, specific intelligence to that effect,” Johnson said on CNN Wednesday evening of the militants also known as ISIS. “And I look at the intelligence reports from overseas from our southern border from our intelligence community virtually every day, numerous times a day, to be on the lookout for something of that nature. So, what I’d say to the American public is we’re vigilant in looking out for individuals of suspicion who may be crossing our border.”

Johnson never mentioned Hunter by name, but he has called on lawmakers to act responsibly and not frighten Americans. “Let’s not unduly create fear and anxiety in the American public by passing on speculation and rumor,” Johnson said.

The group Judicial Watch reported late Wednesday that four “Islamic terrorists” had been seized along the southern border within 36 hours. Hunter said in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday that ""at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""",agree
1015,Weatherman caught peeing live on camera,"New York (CNN) -- When war reporter James Foley wasn't writing for GlobalPost or recording video for AFP or appearing on the PBS ""NewsHour,"" he occasionally shared stories on his own blog, aptly titled ""A World of Troubles.""

For a subtitle, he chose the famous Carl von Clausewitz sentence ""War is fought by human beings.""

And that is exactly what Foley sought to show with his reporting: humanity amid the horror of war.

Foley was abducted while on a reporting trip in northern Syria in November 2012. He was never heard from again.

A video published Tuesday by the extremist group ISIS showed Foley being beheaded. It is not known when or where the video was recorded.

For Foley's family and friends, the recording was the answer they hoped they'd never hear to their questions about his disappearance.

""We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,"" his mother, Diane, said Tuesday night,

She called him ""an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person.""

Courageous, generous

Foley was the oldest child of Diane and John Foley of Rochester, New Hampshire. He had four siblings.

Foley -- Jim to his friends -- had been reporting from war-torn countries for the better part of four years when he disappeared in Syria.

On Tuesday, fellow journalists remembered him for his courage and his generosity.

One of his friends, Alex Sherman of Bloomberg News, wrote on Twitter that he was a ""funny, warm, Big Lebowski-loving guy.""

Another friend, Max Fisher of Vox, praised his ""dedication to truth and understanding.""

Fisher also wrote that ""Jim's faith was something we all agreed not to discuss publicly while he was held in Syria, but it was the wellspring of his generosity,""

He recalled how Foley helped to organize a memorial fund for a photographer, Anton Hammerl, who was killed in Libya in 2011.

Foley had been traveling with Hammerl and two other journalists at the time, and the three who survived wound up in a Libyan jail.

Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors

Front-line journalist

Foley was freed six weeks later. Afterward, in a video interview with the Boston Globe, he hesitated to make the story about himself, remarking at one point that ""you don't want to be defined as 'that guy who got captured in 2011.'""

""I believe that front-line journalism is important, you know -- without these photos and videos and first-hand experience, we can't really tell the world how bad it might be,"" he said.

One of the journalists detained with Foley in Libya, Clare Morgana Gillis, said his fundraising for Hammerl's family was ""the same impulse that compelled him to cut short his much-needed break from reporting in Syria when a colleague went missing last summer, and to raise money for an ambulance for Aleppo's Dar al-Shifa field hospital, where he spent weeks filming the plight of doctors who struggled to save lives with minimal space equipment.""

His time as a teacher

For Foley, these were acts of service, not entirely unlike his time spent in the Teach for America program. He began teaching in Phoenix in 1996.

""He'd promise students that he'd take them to the Castles and Coasters amusement park if they would come to class everyday,"" a fellow Teach for America alum, Sarah Fang, recalled in an essay in 2013.

Foley later ""taught reading and writing to inmates at the Cook County Sheriff's Boot Camp in Chicago,"" according to a Columbia Journalism Review feature about him.

Would you watch the video?

His journalism career

In the mid-2000s he decided to pursue a journalism career, first by enrolling at Northwestern University's well-respected Medill School of Journalism and then by embedding with American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. While preparing for his first embed, he started his blog.

Foley freelanced for a number of news media outlets, including GlobalPost, a world news Web site founded in 2009.

In 2012, he gravitated toward the spiraling conflict in Syria.

Fang, who kept in touch with Foley after their years teaching in Phoenix, wrote that his interest in the story there did not surprise her.

""He's always been willing to step into a zone where no one else wants to go,"" she wrote. ""Jim feels that society needs reporters willing to bear witness and report back the facts of history-in-the-making. And his loyalty to his colleagues meant that he wanted to be there with them on the frontlines.""

BuzzFeed Middle East correspondent Sheera Frenkel said she last saw Foley about a week before his final trip into Syria.

Drinking beers at the lobby of a hotel popular among journalists, they talked, she said, about ""how hard it was to move on from this job, into a life which would allow for marriage and family.""

""He was a generous colleague, never holding back a tip, phone number, or detail that could help, and could spend hours talking over the ins and outs of a story to get it just right,"" Frenkel wrote in an email message.

""Jim was a great journalist, and I think he'd like to be remembered that way, first and foremost.""

After the news of Foley's killing spread on Tuesday, CBS News foreign correspondent Clarissa Ward changed her profile picture on Twitter to a photo of Foley wearing a helmet, a flak jacket and holding up a camera.

This, she said, ""is how I will chose to remember James -- as a brave and tireless journalist with a passion for the Syrian cause.""

It was first posted on Reddit by user fryd_ first and informed parents the “urge to create is equally strong in all children: Boys and girls”.

Speaking to i100.co.uk, Emma Owen of Lego UK and Ireland said the letter was part of a pamphlet showing a variety of Lego doll house products targeted at girls aged four and up from the 1970s.

Commenting on the message, fryd_ first said “it seems like we’ve taken a step backwards” in forty years but Lego disagree.

The text remains relevant to this day – our focus has always been, and remains to bring creative play experiences to all children in the world, based on the Lego brick and the Lego system – ultimately enabling children to build and create whatever they can imagine.

Emma Owens of Lego
The letter from 1974 in full:

To Parents

The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.

It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.

A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses.

The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.

It’s not the first time an old message from Lego has gone viral. This 1981 advert from the company was aimed at all children and shared widely online in January 2014.

According to Sam Arnold, who posted the video on YouTube, the footage was recorded on a helmet camera during a “joint helicopter raid” in the Now Zad district of Helmand Province in 2013.

At the start of the incredible three-minute video, gunfire is heard in the background, and three Marines decide to try to find out where the shots came from. They pass through a tunnel stocked with barrels and wood, and peek through a doorway on the south side of the compound. Then, a bullet strikes one of the Marine’s helmets, knocking his head back. The three marines turn around and run back to their original position.

“Dude, you got shot,” says the Marine who caught the dramatic event on camera. “I saw it hit your kevlar.”

“I did get shot,” the other Marine replies. He seems remarkably calm, but a little dazed. His only complaint is that his ears are ringing.

“Lucky son of a b—h,” says the one with the camera.

1018,WAS NBC METEOROLOGIST MIKE SEIDEL PEEING IN THE SNOW ON CAMERA? A TESTY BRIAN WILLIAMS EXPLAINS,"The weather man was reporting from Sugar Mountain N.C. Saturday night when anchor Lester Holt said he was going to give a live report. But Seidel’s back was facing the camera and it appeared to many viewers he was answering Mother Nature’s call instead of reporting on it. But the network said he had dropped his phone in the snow and was looking for it.

The TV news weather forecast appeared to call for yellow snow — but the network says it was not so.

NBC weatherman Mike Seidel missed a live report from snow-blanketed North Carolina on Saturday night because his back was to the camera. And the way he turned around while also on camera — appearing to zip up the fly of his pants before putting his gloves back on — suggested to viewers that he had been relieving himself.

During the telecast anchor Lester Holt said hello to the No. 1 Weather Channel meteorologist who was in Sugar Mountain, but his back was turned to the camera.

Seidel's body was slightly hunched over and he was looking downward near some trees.

After a few pauses Seidel can be heard asking ""Why?"" as he starts to turn around. The weather man is holding his gloves in his hands despite the cold temperature.

As he turns he slightly moves his arm, which may have been an attempt to close an open zipper. He then hurriedly puts his gloves back on.

A network official told the Daily News that Seidel had dropped his cell phone in the snow and had turned around to find it.

Seidel has tweeted pictures of the snowstorm on his Twitter account, but did not make any mention of the incident.

1019,Macaulay Culkin dead hoax: Fake death report spreads on social networks,"When Tim Cook finally announced the long-awaited Apple Watch on September 9, the company promised an “early 2015” release. Since then, it’s really been anybody’s guess as to when, exactly, that might end up being. A few new rumors, however, suggest that we’ll get the Apple Watch sometime in February…but it’s likely that it’ll be later than that.

Today, a post on 9to5Mac points the way back to a report from Chinese site Feng, which itself cites “Taiwanese media” as saying that the Apple Watch is likely to hit sometime in February, though not without a fair bit of challenges to overcome. The reports say that the supply of sapphire crystal – which will compose the displays of the highest-end Apple Watch units – has led to some difficulties in manufacturing.

However, it should be noted that if sapphire is the biggest problem facing the Apple Watch, then Apple’s in good shape. The software itself is still in development, and as the 9to5Mac post points out, the company has yet to release the WatchKit SDK for developers to start making all the cool apps that’ll run on the device.

Another report from Asia this week claims that production on the Apple Watch isn’t set to start at manufacturing partner Quanta until sometime in January – and with only a month of actual production, it seems doubtful that Apple would truly be ready to sell the Watch by February. And last week, an unnamed Apple insider was quoted as saying that the company would be “lucky to ship it by Valentine’s Day.” If that quote is true, then February seems like a tall order.

That said, March doesn’t seem too out of the question. Nor does April. In fact, considering that Motorola promised the Moto 360 smartwatch by “summer 2014,” and didn’t launch it until early September, it would seem that OEMs are pretty loose about their definitions for launch windows. “Early 2015” is simply anything before the very last day in June. And barring any major disasters, we should start to see Apple Watches on consumers’ wrists long before then.

The main question, though, is what cool stuff will the competition cook up between then and now…",unrelated

1023,Reports of missing Libyan planes raise 9/11 terror fears,"Eleven commercial jets have reportedly been stolen in recent weeks in Libya, and Western intelligence agencies have begun warning they could be used in terror attacks on Sept. 11, the anniversary of the devastating Osama bin Laden-orchestrated attacks on New York and Washington that left nearly 3,000 dead.
According to a report in the Free Beacon, the jets were taken by Islamist militias in Libya, and reports distributed within the U.S. government “included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack … on the date marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks …”

One official in the report assembled by the highly respected Bill Gertz said, “There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

Gertz now is senior editor of the Free Beacon, but he built his career during 27 years as reporter, editor and columnist with the Washington Times. He’s also authored six books and his online biography reveals the state-run Xinhua news agency in 2006 identified him as the No. 1 “anti-China expert” in the world.

His report about the missing jetliners notes authorities have a high level of concern because of the convergence of the cases of missing airplanes and the 13th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.

It also is just two years after the Sept. 11 terror attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, a scandal that still is reverberating through the Obama administration and threatening to become a game-changer for the 2014 elections.

Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in that attack.

What do YOU think? Do you fear for America’s safety? Sound off in today’s WND poll.

A State Department official declined comment, Gertz reported.

The officials quoted by Gertz said U.S. intelligence agencies now are trying to locate all the airplanes belonging to two Libyan airline companies, and they have not confirmed the aircraft theft, which reportedly happened after the takeover by terrorists of Tripoli International Airport in August.

“The state-owned Libyan Airlines fleet until this summer included 14 passenger and cargo jetliners, including seven Airbus 320s, one Airbus 330, two French ATR-42 turboprop aircraft, and four Bombardier CJR-900s,” the report said. “Libyan state-owned Afriqiyah Airways fleet is made up of 13 aircraft, including three Airbus 319s, seven Airbus 320s, two Airbus 330s, and one Airbus 340.”

The report blames Libyan Dawn, one of the terror organizations operating there, for the alleged thefts in late August.

Following the warnings from Western intelligence agencies, Tunisia halted flights from Tripoli, Sirte and Misrata because of the potential the jets would appear in suicide missions, the report said.

And Egypt halted flights to and from Libya.

Gertz said military components from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt were put on a higher level of alert.

Libya has been an uncontrolled disaster area since the Obama administration engineered the removal in 2011 of strongman Muammar Gadhafi from office. His departure left terror factions struggling for control as the nation plunged into chaos.

Both Libyan Dawn and another group called Ansar al-Shariah were declared by Libya’s parliament to be terror groups. The report said Ansar al-Shariah reportedly has surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft guns and rocket-propelled grenades, among other weapons.

Abderrahmane Mekkaoui, a Moroccan military expert, explained to Al Jazeera broadcasting that “credible intelligence” reports say the jets are intended for use by a group called Masked Men Brigade for attacks on the 9/11 date.

Gertz reported that a counterterrorism expert, Sebastian Gorka, explained the events that could develop with the stolen jets.

“The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept. 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,” he said.

“The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,” he said.

Gertz’s report noted the planes themselves become an agent of destruction.

“Who needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes?” asked Michael Rubin, of the American Enterprise Institute. “Even empty, but loaded up with fuel, they can be as devastating.”",discuss
1024,Comcast gets customer fired for complaining about poor service,"There have been lots of “Comcast delivers bad customer service” stories lately — so overwhelming, in fact, that the company just appointed an executive to solve the problem amid worries that disgruntled customers could derail the company’s merger with Time Warner — but the latest story may be the worst: A Comcast customer says the company got him fired from the job.


Consumerist reports that the customer — known in the story only as ""Conal"" — began subscribing to Comcast in 2013 under a promotional offer, but almost immediately found himself charged for set-top boxes that had not been activated. He says he met with a Comcast rep in May of that year to sort out the billing issues, but they actually got worse from there.

He attempted to cancel, but was persuaded to stay for three free months of The Movie Channel; the company ended up sending him items he hadn't order and charged him more than $1,800 for them. Conal, an accountant, then contacted Comcast's controller. Consumerist reports: ""During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcast’s billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation.""

Here's where the problem develops: Comcast learned where Conal was employed. It just happened to be a company that does business with Comcast.

Consumerist reports that Conal claims he never named the company when he was on the phone with various customer service reps — he believes Comcast must've looked up the information somehow. Nonetheless:

At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal’s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he’d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.

When he was fired, Conal’s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.

Emphasis added.

Consumerist, never a Comcast-friendly publication to begin with, seethes:

""I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller’s office,"" writer Chris Moran says. ""Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened.  And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldn’t have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service he’d paid for.""

Comcast told Consumerist it ""will review (Conal's) lawyer’s letter and respond as quickly as possible.”",discuss
1025,US officials: Video shows American's execution,"Claim: Eleven passenger planes are missing from an airport in Libya.

PROBABLY FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, September 2014]

Seeking truth in stir of 11 missing / stolen commercial airliners from the Libyan airport during the fall of Tripoli.

Origins: In early August 2014, some North African bloggers began to spread stories that several commercial airliners were missing from the Tripoli International Airport during or shortly after the facility was taken over by Zintan militia forces earlier in the summer. Later that month translations of the blog posts began to be picked up by news outlets in Western Europe and passed on as fact rather than gossip; by early September those tales of translations of blogs had spread to the United States under the guise of real news.

The use of airplanes as terrorist weapons in 2001 makes it all too easy for us to anticipate their being used that way again. And despite denials from all sides — the airlines who are not missing any planes, the Libyan transport ministry, and the anti-government forces in control of the airport — the tales have found a ready audience among a populace already on edge in anticipation of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

However, there have been no statements from the State Department, the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, or any other authority warning of stolen airliners. The national threat level has not been raised. Algerian and Moroccan military and air defense, already on high alert due to the unrest just across their borders with Libya, would undoubtedly have noticed multiple flights of unidentified passenger aircraft.

Jesus Murillo Karam said further tests were being carried out on four other recently discovered grave sites.

The 43 students went missing three weeks ago amid violent protests in Iguala, south of Mexico City.

Mr Karam said 14 more police officers had been arrested, accused of handing the students over to a drugs gang.

About 50 people have been arrested in connection with the students' disappearance, with the vast majority being local police officers.

The officers are believed to have been working for a drugs gang, known as the Guerreros Unidos.

On Tuesday, police said the gang's leader, Benjamin Mondragon, had killed himself when he was about to be arrested during an operation by Mexican security forces in the state of Morelos.

The missing students all attended a teacher training college in Iguala, some 200km (125 miles) south of Mexico City.

The college has a history of left-wing activism but it is not clear whether the students were targeted for their political beliefs.

They disappeared after deadly clashes with the police on 26 September in which six people died. Eyewitnesses reported seeing them being bundled into police vans.

The meteorite appeared to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport around midnight and the hit was so large that it registered on the instruments Strauss’s organisation uses to size up earthquakes.

“You can see two waves: first, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth, and then another stronger one, which is the impact of the sound,” he said.

Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday. One of them, William Martinez, said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil.

“You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,” Martinez said.

Government spokeswoman, First Lady Rosario Murillo, said Managua would be in contact with the US Geological Service to try to get more information about “this fascinating event” in the Central American nation, one of Latin America’s poorest countries.

People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion, and that liquid, sand and dust were blown through the air, which smelled like something had burned.

There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot, and flights at the airport were not affected.

NASA said last week that the asteroid 2014 RC, at the time of closest approach, would be approximately one-tenth the distance from the centre of Earth to the moon, or about 40,000 kilometres.

It had been projected to be roughly over New Zealand at the time of its closest approach.

1030,James Foley remembered as 'brave and tireless' journalist,"Two U.S. officials say they believe American journalist James Foley was the victim executed by ISIS militants as shown in a grisly video released Tuesday.

Separately, Foley’s family confirmed his death in a statement posted on a webpage that was created to rally support for his release.

In the statement, Foley’s mother, Diane Foley, said the journalist, quote, “gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.”

One of the U.S. officials said President Barack Obama was expected to make a statement about the killing on Wednesday.

The U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the video by name.

Foley, a 40-year-old freelance journalist from Rochester, New Hampshire, went missing nearly two years ago in northern Syria while on assignment for Agence France-Press and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost. The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control. He had not been heard from since.

Several senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the crushing airstrikes over the last two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar, the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil.

Both areas are in northern Iraq, which has become a key front for the Islamic State as its fighters travel to and from Syria.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the hostage situation by name.

Since Aug. 8, the U.S. military has struck more than 70 Islamic State targets – including security checkpoints, vehicles and weapons caches. It’s not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes, although it’s likely that some were.

The Internet video begins with scenes of President Barack Obama explaining his decision to order airstrikes in Iraq. Then it switches to a balding man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert, a black-clad Islamic State fighter by his side. Foley’s name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen. The video appears to have been shot in an arid area; there is no vegetation in sight and the horizon is in the distance where the sand meets the gray-blue sky.

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists estimated Tuesday that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria, and has not released their nationalities. In its annual report last November, CPJ concluded that the missing journalists are either being held and threatened with death by extremists, or taken captive by gangs seeking ransom. The group’s report described the widespread seizure of journalists as unprecedented and largely unreported by news organizations in the hope that keeping the kidnappings out of public view may help in the captives’ release.

The Islamic State militant group is so ruthless in its attacks against all people they consider heretics or infidels that it has been disowned by al-Qaida’s leaders. In seeking to impose its harsh interpretation of Islamic law in the lands it is trying to control, the extremists have killed soldiers and civilians alike in horrifying executions – including mounting the decapitated heads of some of its victims on spikes.

The group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al-Qaida in Iraq, which beheaded many of its victims, including Americans businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004.",agree
1031,Fake Fox News Website Reports Judd Nelson’s Death for Some Reason,"An audio recording released Tuesday morning may shed light on the death of a Missouri teenager fatally shot by a police officer Aug. 9.

The tape, provided to CNN, allegedly contains audio captured during a Ferguson resident's video chat at the time of the shooting. CNN says the authenticity of the tape has yet to be verified, but what appears to be gunfire can be heard in the background of the call.

As many as 10 shot-like sounds can be heard. Several shots are fired in what appears to be fairly quick succession. There is a brief pause, then more shots are fired.

An autopsy concluded that Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times, with two fatal shots to the head. The Ferguson officer involved has been identified as Darren Wilson, 28.

Law enforcement officials and bystanders have provided differing accounts of what led to the fatal encounter. Police say Wilson stopped Brown and a friend for walking in the street, asking the two to move to the sidewalk, and words were exchanged. According to Wilson's account, he was attacked by Brown as he attempted to exit his cruiser and the two scuffled for the officer's gun inside the car.

Both Wilson and witnesses concede Brown took off running. The witnesses say the officer fired on the unarmed teen as he had his hands up to surrender. Wilson supporters say Brown was bull-rushing Wilson, who shot Brown in self-defense.

The shooting ignited racial tensions, sparking several days and nights of protests, riots, looting and unrest.

Brown's funeral service was Monday, and the case is currently being presented to a grand jury. Attorney General Eric Holder has promised a thorough investigation.

The organization Black Lawyers for Justice plans to file a $200 million class action lawsuit against Ferguson authorities Tuesday, KDSK-TV reported. According to the organization's website, the group's mission is to fight police brutality.

A press conference is set for 1 p.m. CT Tuesday at the U.S. District court building in St. Louis.

1034,Parliament Hill shooting: Sergeant-At-Arms Kevin Vickers the family hero who took down Ottawa gunman,"A spokesman for the Iraqi health ministry denied reports in a local newspaper that militants in Mosul had Ebola

Reports that Isis fighters in Iraq have contracted Ebola have been refuted as “incorrect” and “unfounded” by the country’s health ministry.

Despite reports on Wednesday in the Iraqi paper, al-Sabah, that two cases of Ebola had been reported in Mosul in the north of the country, Ahmed Rudaini, the health ministry’s spokesman dismissed the speculation.

He said the disease could not have been registered, as only the Central Laboratory of Public Health in Baghdad has the “diagnostic capabilities” to confirm cases of Ebola which was reported by the al-Maalomah news website and the International Business Times.

The World Health Organisation also confirmed that they had received no confirmation of Ebola cases from Iraq.

Tarik Jasarevic from the organisation told The Independent: ""WHO is aware of these reports and is working closely with Iraqi MoH to get more information.

""It is unlikely that this case can be a confirmed Ebola case as there is no laboratory facility in Mosul that could do an Ebola test.""

WHO’s director of communications, Christy Feig had earlier told Mashable: “We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.”

The organisation has reached out to the Iraqi government to investigate the claims, should it require assistance, however.

Al-Sabah initially reported that “terrorists” from several unnamed African countries had brought the virus to the country and claimed that two cases of Ebola and 26 cases of HIV/AIDS had been registered by authorities.

Although Isis has recruited foreign fighters in the past, it believed that the majority came from Tunisia, according to a Washington Post report. Very few, if any, militants are thought to have travelled from at-risk areas of West Africa, including Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

The northern city of Mosul fell to Isis six months ago and residents have suffered brutal repression. People are restricted from leaving the city without first nominating a guarantor, water and food supplies are limited and hospitals have been closed due to a lack of electricity.",unrelated
1035,Watch moment TV weatherman is caught urinating in the bushes LIVE on camera,"Mexican hitmen allegedly killed more than a dozen students who went missing last month after a clash with corrupt local police, then buried them in a recently-discovered mass grave.

State prosecutors in the country said a man they arrested told how 17 of the missing youths were rounded up and killed, then thrown in pits, where badly charred remains have now been unearthed.

Authorities said that the man told them how the students, who went missing after a violent clash on September 26, were marched to the site on the outskirts of Iguala, Guerrero state before their deaths.

Scroll down for video

Hunt: A forensic investigator works at the site of the mass graves, near Iguala in Mexico

The bodies found by authorities are so damaged that they could not be identified. All that is left are bones and small pieces of flesh.

Investigators found 28 bodies there, though local officials say as many as 34 were buried across six separate pits.

It could be days before the identities of the dead are known for sure.

Security officials said earlier they believed the victims had been driven to the end of the track, walked up the hillside, executed and buried in six graves.

As investigators worked at the site, up to 2,000 protesters blocked a main highway in the Guerrero state capital of Chilpancingo demanding justice.

'You took them alive, we want them returned alive,' read a huge banner hung across the road linking Mexico City and Acapulco.

Victims: The above poster shows the 43 missing students and offers a reward for their recovery

Remote spot: Officers stand watch near the site of the mass grave on the outskirts of Iguala in Mexico

Mass grave: The roughly 30 bodies in the grave are believed to belong the group of 43 missing students

Jesus Lopez, an Acapulco street vendor whose 19-year-old son Giovani is among the missing, said he hoped the remains weren't those of the students.

Other relatives 'told us that (the remains) were burned, and that they couldn't be the kids,' Lopez said. 'But we're really nervous.'

Mexico's National Human Rights Commission opened its own investigation into the case for possible 'serious human rights abuses,' such as extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances by Iguala city police.

Police infiltrated by local drug cartels are suspected of abducting some of the students, a local security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

One security official said: 'You really can't call them police'.

He added that suspected gang members had told investigators that police had handed over the students to the people who killed them, who belonged to the gang.

Heartbroken: Relatives and colleagues blockade a toll road near the site of the disappearance

The suspected gang members had also helped the authorities identify the site, the security official said.

Soldiers and police had cordoned off the dirt track where it ended not far from the graves, which lay about a 40-minute walk across rocky terrain inaccessible by vehicle.

The fatal clashes took place in Iguala on the night of September 26. Thirty people, including 22 police, have been arrested in connection with the violence, which claimed the lives of at least six people and left 25 injured.

Information leading to the discovery of the graves had in part come from the interrogation of local police arrested after the clashes in Iguala, the security official said.

1036,Robert Plant Reportedly Tears Up $800 Million Led Zeppelin Reunion Contract,"While local reports revealed Wednesday that the Jordanian King Abdullah will authorize airstrikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group, a U.S. official described the Arab monarch as citing a Hollywood movie character when expressing his wrath upon hearing that the militants had burned his countryman pilot alive during his captivity.

“He mentioned ‘Unforgiven’ and he mentioned Clint Eastwood, and he actually quoted a part of the movie,” Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., a Marine Corps veteran of two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, who was in the meeting with the king, told Fox News Channel in an interview aired Wednesday.

King Abdullah had to cut his U.S. trip short after hearing the news that Moaz al-Kasasbeh was burned alive.

During a private session with members of the House Armed Services Committee lawmakers, the king expressed his anger by citing American movie icon Clint Eastwood.

“He said there is going to be retribution like ISIS hasn’t seen,” said the Marine Corps veteran.

However, Hunter would not say which part of “Unforgiven” the king quoted, but noted it was where Eastwood’s character describes how he is going to deliver his retribution.

“He’s angry,” Hunter said of King Abdullah. “They’re starting more sorties tomorrow than they’ve ever had. They’re starting tomorrow. And he said, ‘The only problem we’re going to have is running out of fuel and bullets.’”

“He’s ready to get it on,” Hunter added. “He really is. It reminded me of how we were after 9/11. We were ready to give it to them.”

Hunter also said that the lawmakers and King Abdullah did not make any mention of U.S. President Barack Obama. 
He added: “ISIS is now going to regret this … because King Abdullah is not Barack Obama.”

The Jordan Times reported that thousands of Jordanians gathered on Wednesday to receive King Abdullah.

The Jordan times also reported that mosques and churches around the Kingdom held prayers on Wednesday in memory of al-Kasasbeh.

King not flying missions
Meanwhile, a Jordanian government official on Thursday told Al Arabiya News that King Abdullah was not flying missions against ISIS himself, after local media reports – also taken by some international outlets - indicated he is set to do so.

The official also noted that observers should refrain from calling King Abdullah a fighter pilot as he does not officially hold the title. He is, however, the commander-in-chief of the Jordanian Air Force.

The king is a trained combatant, part of the parachute brigade and flies civilian planes and helicopters, the official added.

1037,Christian Bale won't play Steve Jobs,"Robots are increasingly replacing humans in a variety of mundane tasks, like bolting a car together or making lollipops, but now they are moving into the security business.

Microsoft recently installed a fleet of 5-feet-tall, 300-pound robots to protect its Silicon Valley campus. The robots are packed with HD security cameras and sensors to take in their organic, protein-based surroundings. There’s also an artificial intelligence on board that can sound alarms when the robot notices something awry. It can also read license plates and cross-reference them to see if they’re stolen.

The K5 robots come from a California company called Knightscope, which calls the robots “autonomous data machines” that provide a “commanding but friendly presence.” Sounds like something a robot manufacturer would say.

Let’s be honest though, the robots look pretty damn cool. They’re like modern versions of R2-D2.

Thankfully—or sadly, depending on how you look at it—the K5 robots don’t have any weapons on them. All they can do is assess a situation, sound an alarm to defuse it, or call a human security officer to the scene. There are, however, plans equip the robots with tasers sometime in the future.

Microsoft’s new protectors are fairly autonomous. A single charge will last 24 hours, and if the robot notices that its battery is getting low, it will return to a charging port and plug itself in. It can fully recharge in 20 minutes, which is pretty insane.

There are plans to one day expand the use of Knightscope’s robots and have them patrol the streets as part of human police units. We can’t even imagine what would happen if Elon Musk heard about this.

1038,Vandals add rude paint job to $2.5m Bugatti (but luckily for the owner it all turned out to be a hoax),"A woman who claims to be the girlfriend of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps revealed in a Facebook post that she was born intersex, a fact she has not previously revealed to Phelps, among others.

Taylor Lianne Chandler, 41, wrote a lengthy post describing her early life, saying that at birth she had male genitalia with no testicles as well as a uterus, without ovaries. Born David Roy Fitch, she writes that she went on testosterone blockers and changed her name to Paige Victoria Whitney in her teens, then had surgery when she was in her 20s. She writes in a post she put up Nov. 13:

“By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one. In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery. …

“The problem is I have made friends that I never told and dated and married people that knew nothing of my past,” she writes. “If you don’t understand what intersex is, Google it. I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.”

According to the Intersex Society of America:

A general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male. For example, a person might be born appearing to be female on the outside, but having mostly male-typical anatomy on the inside. Or a person may be born with genitals that seem to be in-between the usual male and female types.

Chandler, who writes that she thinks her revelation may cause Phelps to terminate their relationship, claims on a Facebook page filled with photos of Phelps that she met the 29-year-old swimmer on Tinder and said their relationship was “like a teenage love affair” and that they attended a Baltimore Ravens game on their first date. Phelps has not commented on the post and spent the month of October in rehab after his DUI arrest in September. He is serving a six-month suspension by U.S. Swimming and his DUI trial in Baltimore is set for Dec. 19.

On Wednesday, she wrote: “Heard from Michael he is out of rehab and back home” and added that she is frustrated with how her story is being reported.

The lucky pet, which is a member of the carp family, survived the 50-minute operation before going home with his owner. Bethell used a small heart rate monitor to ensure the fish was sufficiently drugged before using a mini-scalpel to remove several blockages near the anus and dorsal fin.

Normally when you think of the homeless, you probably picture some drug or alcohol addict who is only taking money from passerby to support their next fix. Some of them even make more money than the average full-time employee working legally just because they’re good actors with bad clothes and not homeless at all.

Instead of assuming the worst, Josh put his money into finding the truth. He started the video asking the audience a question and explaining his idea.

“When you give homeless people money, do you ever wonder how they spent it? Today I’m going to give a homeless guy a hundred dollars, and I’m going to follow him and see how he spent it.”

Josh approached a homeless man at an intersection holding up one of the usual cardboard signs asking for help, and begins a conversation with the man. As Josh hands the man the hundred dollars, he tears up at the generosity, telling him plainly that nobody’s ever given him that much.

Josh then left the intersection as the camera remained trained on the man. As expected, the first place he went was a liquor store, but if you watch what happens, it’s not what you’re probably thinking. Coming out with a few things in bags, he made his way to the park and started handing food and other items to the homeless people there.

He confessed that he had the man followed to see what he would do, and had his doubts initially. The man told Josh that some of the homeless are just people who fell on hard luck, and he told him his story.

To reward the man for his generosity paid forward, Josh gave him another hundred dollars.

1042,"11 Tripoli Planes Still Missing, Sparks 9/11 Concerns","Boko Haram has denied claims by Nigeria's government that it has agreed to a ceasefire and will release more than 200 abducted schoolgirls.

The group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, said the girls had converted to Islam and been married off since being taken.

Nigeria's army announced a ceasefire with the militants on 17 October, saying the girls would soon be freed.

But violence has continued since news of the alleged truce, including a fatal bomb blast on Friday.

Boko Haram has been fighting an insurgency since 2009, with some 2,000 civilians reportedly killed this year.

'We will not negotiate'

In a video released on Friday, Abubakar Shekau said: ""We have not made ceasefire with anyone. We did not negotiate with anyone. It's a lie.

""We will not negotiate. What is our business with negotiation? Allah said we should not.""

Shekau also claimed that the militants were holding a German national, thought to be a teacher, who was kidnapped by gunmen in July.

There was no indication of when or where the group's latest video was shot.

The BBC's Tomi Oladipo in Lagos says the video will come as a huge embarrassment for the Nigerian government after it said it had secured a ceasefire with Boko Haram.

The Islamist militants sparked global outrage in April by abducting 219 schoolgirls from the remote north-eastern town of Chibok, in Borno state.

Their continued captivity has led to criticism of the Nigerian government's efforts to secure their release.

Hopes were raised earlier this month when Nigeria's chief of defence staff, Alex Badeh, announced a truce with the group.

""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" he said. ""I am cautiously optimistic.""

But the Boko Haram leader said the girls were ""in their marital homes"" after being married off by the group.

Last week, Human Rights Watch said in a report that Boko Haram was holding more than 500 women and young girls captive and that forced marriage was common in the group's camps.",unrelated

“In life we have met, and in the afterlife, we have the hope - we ask God to see you in happiness, in a place where this no boredom. In heaven,” it read.

The YouTube video featured a collage of pictures of the young boy who is believed to be 10-years-old. The images, which show him wearing military clothes and carrying arms, cannot be independently verified however.

Other pictures show him posing with his “martyred” father. The video has garnered at least 56,296 views as of Thursday.

On Twitter, a “Cub of Baghdadi is Staying” twitter account dedicated to the boy has 4,309 followers as of Thursday.

There were mixed reactions to the reports of his death.

On YouTube, one user commenting said “Oh mother, I did not die, but I am a martyr with my God,” while another user on Twitter said: “God bless you cub of Baghdadi, your picture has made me cry. I swear I wished if I was in your
place.”

Charlie Cooper, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation, told The Independent newspaper that those sharing the pictures are paying tribute to the child as the youngest martyr from the Arabian Peninsula to have been killed in Syria.

However, there were others who criticized and scorned the use of children in conflict.

On YouTube commented said: “Unfortunately everyday a child in Palestine is martyred either because of conflict, hunger or sickness. We did not see anyone objecting…”

Another rebuked the use of children in conflicts on YouTube: “Is this holy jihad? Brainwashing kids’ brains?”

1045,Sugarhill Gang rapper Big Bank Hank dies aged 57,"Big Bank Hank, a member of the early hip-hop group the Sugarhill Gang has died of complications from cancer at age 57. The group were responsible for one of the most popular rap songs of all time, Rapper’s Delight.

The musician died Tuesday at a hospital in Englewood, New Jersey, according to David Mallie, a business manager for two former members of the group, and Aree Booker, a funeral director with Eternity Funeral Services.

Big Bank Hank, whose real name was Henry Jackson, was born in the Bronx borough of New York. He was a part of the Sugarhill Gang in 1979 when it had hip-hop’s first hit with Rapper’s Delight. The song was released as hip-hop began to emerge as a genre, and landed in the top 40 on the Billboard charts. It also peaked at No 4 on the Hot Soul singles chart, now called the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs chart.

The Sugarhill Gang, which was formed in Englewood, also included Guy O’Brien (Master Gee) and Michael Wright (Wonder Mike).

“So sad to hear about our brother’s passing,” O’Brien and Wright said in a statement issued through Mallie. “The three of us created musical history together with the release of Rapper’s Delight. We will always remember traveling the world together and rocking the house. Rest in peace Big Bank.”

Rapper’s Delight became a success thanks in part to the late record label owner Sylvia Robinson, who released the song on Sugar Hill Records. Robinson, who was known as the “mother of hip-hop”, died in 2011.

After Rapper’s Delight, the trio had minor successes with songs such as Apache and 8th Wonder, but faded away. Their last album was a 1999 children’s rap album, Jump On It!

O’Brien and Wright currently perform under the name Rapper’s Delight Experience Featuring Wonder Mike and Master Gee, Mallie said. Robinson’s son owns the Sugarhill Gang trademark, and O’Brien and Wright haven’t been able to perform under the name since 2010, he said.

Hagel added that Friday's operation was undertaken when ""there were compelling reasons to believe Mr. Somers' life was in imminent danger.""

""Several of the AQAP terrorists holding the hostages captive were killed in the mission,"" he said.

""The rescue attempt took place in central Yemen and was conducted in partnership with the Government of Yemen.

""Yesterday's mission is a reminder of America's unrelenting commitment to the safety of our fellow citizens -- wherever they might be around the world.

The school in Banja Luka had taken 28 girls to the nation’s capital city for a five-day trip to visit museums and historic sights in the city, ranked among the finest in the world.

“That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,” he told Inserbia.info.

Educational institutes and parents should, he said, play a stronger role in providing effective sex education.

The hospital issued the statement to stop rumors and online reports that the patient was being treated for the disease.

""These reports are inaccurate,"" said HCA Midwest Health spokeswoman Chris Hamele.

She said the patient was taken to the hospital's main campus, where he being treated appropriately for his illness and is responding well in good condition. The man had one of the symptoms of Ebola and had recently traveled to Nigeria.

The symptoms of the disease can include a high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding and bruising.

Local health officials have said it's extremely unlikely that the patient has Ebola.

Family members with patients in the emergency room at Research Medical Center said it was business as usual there on Sunday.

""If it's something we should have been concerned about, I think they would have said something,"" said patient Collette Harvin.

Marcus Mitchem, who was visiting a patient, said Ebola is a scary thing to think about.

""The most concerning thing about the Ebola virus is no known cure. You get it, you die. That causes concern for everybody,"" he said.

Several Americans who contracted Ebola while in Africa have returned to the United States and responded well to treatment, in part due to safety protocols at American hospitals.

Hamele said Research Medical Center has standard infectious disease precautions, and is well-equipped and well prepared to implement them.

""As health care providers, our job is to care for sick patients and we will continue to provide high quality care to our community as we always have,"" Hamele said.

Harvin said she's not really afraid about Ebola.

""We have measures here. We have medicine,"" she said. ""If we were in Africa or something like that, I'd be a little more worried.""

The Kansas City Health Department said in a tweet that local hospitals have procedures to protect patients, staff and visitors from infectious diseases. It said it has complete faith that Research Medical Center is taking the appropriate steps.

1055,"Insiders Claim Steel Apple Watch to Start at $500, Gold at $4,000","British man suspected of appearing in videos of hostages being beheaded

The British Isis militant suspected of appearing in videos showing the beheading of US and UK hostages has been named in reports as Mohammed Emwazi from London.

The Washington Post published a lengthy article naming the masked man known as Jihadi John, who spoke in the videos with a British accent.

Emwazi, believed to be aged 27, was known to MI5 as a ""person of interest"" in 2011, according to the BBC. It reports that his name was not revealed at an earlier stage for ""operational reasons"".

One of Emwazi's friends was quoted by The Post as saying: “I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John.""

The Post claims that Emwazi is from an affluent family in west London and graduated from the University of Westminster with a degree in computer programming. It says he is believed to have travelled to Syria in 2012 and later joined Isis.

An international manhunt led by the FBI was launched in August 2014 when he was thought to have appeared in video footage showing the beheading of American photojournalist James Foley.

Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said there was an ""extremely strong resemblance"", between the militant in the videos and Emwazi. Mr Qureshi says he was in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria.

Foley's death was followed by the brutal killing of four more UK and US aid workers and journalists, all of whom were shown in footage next to a balaclava clad militant dressed in black, believed to be Jihadi John.

He is thought to have been featured in videos threatening the lives of Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, who were later killed by the extremist group.

The name 'Jihadi John' came after it was reported that hostages referred to the militant as 'John' during their time captive.

Emwazi is reported to have started to become radicalised after a trip he planned to Tanzania. He and two friends were detained by police overnight after landing in Dar es Salaam and eventually deported.

It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabaab operates.

Mr Qureshi says he met with Emwazi in the autumn after he returned from this trip to discuss what had taken place. “Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,” Mr Qureshi told The Post.

The Post reports that Emwazi then moved to Kuwait, his birthplace, and returned to London twice before being detained by counterterrorism officials in Britain, who took his fingerprints and searched his belongings.

He was allegedly prevented from returning to Kuwait, telling Mr Qureshi in an email: “I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started, but now I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London.""

Mr Qureshi last spoke to Emwazi in 2012 when he contacted him for advice. He felt “actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions"", according to Mr Qureshi.

One friend said he believed Emwazi had wanted to teach English in Saudi Arabia but had been unsuccessful shortly before he disappeared.

“He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out,"" the friend was quoted as saying.

The Metropolitan Police said in a statement: ""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

The Home Office said it would neither confirm nor deny reports at this stage.",unrelated

It is understood that he was known to British security services who chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons.

A close friend of Emwazi told the Washington Post: “I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John.

""He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him.""

Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services.

Asked if David Cameron was concerned about Emwazi's name being reported, a No 10 spokeswoman said: ""The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.

""There is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep British people safe.""

Kuwaiti-born Emwazi is believed to have been raised in a middle-class area of west London, at times attending a mosque in Greenwich.

He is understood to have graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Westminster, after which he started to become radicalised.

The Post claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day.

It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates.

He is thought to have travelled to Syria in 2012, before joining IS (also known as Isis or Isil), according to the Post.

According to the BBC's Dominic Casciani, Emwazi was a ""person of interest"" to British security services from at least 2011.

He apparently featured in ""semi-secret court cases relating to extremism overseas and back in the UK"".

He is thought to have been responsible for the brutal executions of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, American aid worker Peter Kassig, British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines and Japanese hostages Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa.

Each killing was publicised in a series of highly-produced video clips.

The masked executioner appeared to speak with a British accent, prompting speculation about his identity.

The killer gained his moniker after being nicknamed 'John' by a group of his hostages.

He was apparently part of a terrorist cell described as 'the Beatles', with other members known as 'George', 'Paul' and 'Ringo'.

Commander Richard Walton of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) said:

""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: ""(The) Prime Minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL (Islamic State) to face justice for the appalling acts carried out.

""There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria.

1058,"Boko Haram leader denies ceasefire deal, says 200 abducted girls married off ","Claim: Eleven passenger planes are missing from an airport in Libya.

PROBABLY FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, September 2014]

Seeking truth in stir of 11 missing / stolen commercial airliners from the Libyan airport during the fall of Tripoli.

Origins: In early August 2014, some North African bloggers began to spread stories that several commercial airliners were missing from the Tripoli International Airport during or shortly after the facility was taken over by Zintan militia forces earlier in the summer. Later that month translations of the blog posts began to be picked up by news outlets in Western Europe and passed on as fact rather than gossip; by early September those tales of translations of blogs had spread to the United States under the guise of real news.

The use of airplanes as terrorist weapons in 2001 makes it all too easy for us to anticipate their being used that way again. And despite denials from all sides — the airlines who are not missing any planes, the Libyan transport ministry, and the anti-government forces in control of the airport — the tales have found a ready audience among a populace already on edge in anticipation of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

However, there have been no statements from the State Department, the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, or any other authority warning of stolen airliners. The national threat level has not been raised. Algerian and Moroccan military and air defense, already on high alert due to the unrest just across their borders with Libya, would undoubtedly have noticed multiple flights of unidentified passenger aircraft.

Oliver Ilic, 22, reportedly removed the organ with one slice of a razor blade. Unable to stop the bleeding, he was forced to contact medics, who rushed him to a hospital in Kocani as blood began to soak through his jeans.

Although hopes for reattachment initially didn't look good–some sites reported yesterday that the hospital didn't have any doctors qualified to perform the surgery—Ilic was transferred to a different facility in Skopje, where he was surgically reunited with his poor little cock.

It's too early to tell if he'll regain full function—such as it was—in the organ.

Ilic's isn't the most tragic case of self-mutilation in Macedonia this year. According to European tabloid lore, a 40-year-old man recently cut off his penis, too, but reattachment was impossible: He had flushed it down the toilet.

Banksy has not been arrested, despite a report stating the contrary.

“The Banksy arrest is a hoax,” the street artist’s publicist, Jo Brooks, told The Independent.

However, the prank seems to have duped the internet, with his name quickly trending on Twitter.

A false story, published on US website National Report, alleged that the identity of the British street artist had finally been revealed and he had been arrested by London’s Metropolitan Police and is being held “without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting”.

The story claimed that Banksy’s London art studio had been raided, where “thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism” were found, along with ID thought to belong to the famed anonymous street artist, which allegedly identified him as Liverpool-born Paul Homer.

However, a quick google search shows that the quotes were originally published in 2013 on hoax website on PRLog.

Nonetheless, the joke struck a nerve with Louise Mensch, who fell wholeheartedly for the ‘news’ and chastised the police for arresting the street artist and not focusing on other more pressing issues.

“This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State,” the masked men reportedly said, addressing U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron. The video also contains a threat to second British hostage.

This time around, the message from the Islamic State is very much aimed at @David_Cameron, with a 2nd British hostage threatened.

The UK Foreign Office is ""working urgently"" to verify the authenticity of the alleged Haines beheading video, Sky News reports. If verified, the execution would constitute ""another disgusting murder,"" the government organization said.

Haines’ relatives pleaded Saturday with ISIS to “make contact” and respond to their messages, NBC News reported. “We are the family of David Haines,” the relatives said in a statement. “We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.”

The British aid worker was identified as ISIS’ next target for beheading in the video which showed the execution of American journalist Steven Sotloff. Militants vowed to kill Haines if the United States military did not end military operations against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

A father of two, Haines was kidnapped in Syria while working with an organization that assists refugees from the country’s civil war, the New York Daily News reported. He was taken captive near the Turkish border.",unrelated
1067,Watch US Marine get shot in HEAD by Taliban sniper - and live to tell tale,"Dramatic footage from an Afghanistan battlefield shows the moment a U.S. Marine survived a bullet to his head, thanks to his kevlar helmet.

According to Sam Arnold, who posted the video on YouTube, the footage was recorded on a helmet camera during a “joint helicopter raid” in the Now Zad district of Helmand Province in 2013.

At the start of the incredible three-minute video, gunfire is heard in the background, and three Marines decide to try to find out where the shots came from. They pass through a tunnel stocked with barrels and wood, and peek through a doorway on the south side of the compound. Then, a bullet strikes one of the Marine’s helmets, knocking his head back. The three marines turn around and run back to their original position.

“Dude, you got shot,” says the Marine who caught the dramatic event on camera. “I saw it hit your kevlar.”

“I did get shot,” the other Marine replies. He seems remarkably calm, but a little dazed. His only complaint is that his ears are ringing.

“Lucky son of a b—h,” says the one with the camera.

The three Marines join other members of their unit and head off to track down the “Taliban sniper” before the video ends. The footage was uploaded two weeks ago and has been viewed more than 610,000 times.",agree

1069,CNN Airs Alleged Audio from Michael Brown Shooting,"Planetary Alignment On Jan 4, 2015 Will Decrease Gravity For 5 Minutes Causing Partial Weightlessness.

Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015.

According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.

Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.

Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun, within an arc 95° wide. But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earth’s crust is maximum even at their closest approach.

But don’t get too excited. If you think you’ll be able to float around your house, you’re wrong. But, if you jump in the air at 9:47 AM PST, on January 4, 2015, it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 0.2 seconds.

So, mark this date on your calendar and share it with your friends! Zero gravity day is just around the corner!",unrelated
1070,ISIS Beheads Kidnapped Photojournalist James Wright Foley in Horrific Video Message to the U.S.,"In a horrifying act of revenge for U.S. airstrikes in northern Iraq, militants with the Islamic State extremist group have beheaded American journalist James Foley — and are threatening to kill another hostage, U.S. officials say.

The White House must now weigh the risks of adopting an aggressive policy to destroy the Islamic State against resisting any action that could result in the death of another American.

It will also confront the potentially necessary step of pursuing the Islamic State in Syria, where President Barack Obama has resisted launching airstrikes or deploying significant American firepower.

Obama was expected to make a statement Wednesday about Foley's killing.

U.S. officials confirmed a grisly video released Tuesday showing Islamic State militants beheading Foley. Separately, Foley's family confirmed his death in a statement posted on a Facebook page that was created to rally support for his release, saying they ""have never been prouder of him.""

""He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,"" said the statement, which was attributed to Foley's mother, Diane Foley. She implored the militants to spare the lives of other hostages. ""Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.""

Foley, 40, from Rochester, New Hampshire, went missing in northern Syria in November 2012 while freelancing for Agence France-Presse and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost. The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control. He had not been heard from since.

The beheading marks the first time the Islamic State has killed an American citizen since the Syrian conflict broke out in March 2011, upping the stakes in an increasingly chaotic and multilayered war. The killing is likely to complicate U.S. involvement in Iraq and the Obama administration's efforts to contain the group as it expands in both Iraq and Syria.

The group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al-Qaida in Iraq, which beheaded many of its victims, including American businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004.

The video released on websites Tuesday appears to show the increasing sophistication of the Islamic State group's media unit and begins with scenes of Obama explaining his decision to order airstrikes.

It then cuts to a balding man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert, next to a black-clad militant with a knife to his throat. Foley's name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen. After the captive speaks, the masked man is shown apparently beginning to cut at his neck; the video fades to black before the beheading is completed. The next shot appears to show the captive lying dead on the ground, his head on his body. The video appears to have been shot in an arid area; there is no vegetation to be seen and the horizon is in the distance where the sand meets the gray-blue sky.

At the end of the video, a militant shows a second man, who was identified as another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, and warns that he could be the next captive killed. Sotloff was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border in August 2013; he had freelanced for Time, the National Interest and MediaLine.

One U.S. official said the video appeared to be authentic, and two other U.S. officials said the victim was Foley. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the killing by name.

Several senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the crushing airstrikes over the past two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar, the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil.

Both areas are in northern Iraq, which has become a key front for the Islamic State as its fighters travel to and from Syria.

Since Aug. 8, the U.S. military has struck at least 70 Islamic State targets — including security checkpoints, vehicles and weapons caches. It's not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes, although it's likely that some were.

The Islamic State militant group is so ruthless in its attacks against all people they consider heretics or infidels that it has been disowned by al-Qaida's leaders. In seeking to impose its harsh interpretation of Islamic law in the lands it is trying to control, the extremists have slain soldiers and civilians alike in horrifying ways — including mounting the decapitated heads of some of its victims on spikes.

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists estimated Tuesday that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria, and has not released their nationalities. In its annual report in November, the committee concluded that the missing journalists were either being held and threatened with death by extremists, or taken captive by gangs seeking ransom. The group's report described the widespread seizure of journalists as unprecedented and largely unreported by news organizations in the hope that keeping the kidnappings out of public view may help in the captives' release.

1071,Is the Alleged Audio of the Gunshots That Killed Michael Brown a Hoax?,"A 31-year-old Canadian-Israeli woman who traveled to Iraq to join the Kurdish fight against the Islamic State group reportedly has been abducted by ISIS. Gill Rosenberg, 31, a former Israeli soldier, was captured after three suicide bombings near Kobani, the Times of Israel reported.

The SITE Intelligence Group said jihadists are discussing ideas for executing her or using her for a prisoner exchange. The capture was reported Sunday on the Islamic State-associated blog Samoach al-Islam and other Islamist websites. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said it is investigating the claim, which was not backed by any evidence, the Jerusalem Post said. The Israeli security service Shin Bet told the Post it had “no further details” about the reported abduction.

Quoting two Kurdish fighters, Israel Radio reported Rosenberg was not near Kobani.

The Post noted if the claim is true, it would make Rosenberg, who was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, and moved to Israel in 2006, the first Western female to fall into the Islamic State group’s hands and her Israeli citizenship could complicate the situation even further.

Sorry to rain on the rumor mill's parade, but RoboCop-style robots are not patrolling Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus.

The rumor took shape after California-based Knightscope showed off its K5 security robot at an event hosted at Microsoft, according to Knightscope co-founder and Vice President Stacy Stephens.

""So people started snapping photos,"" and all the sudden a number of news outlets were reporting the robots had been deployed at Microsoft's offices in Mountain View, Calif., Stephens said.

Knighscope has built the security-guard-mimicking robot and it is trying out the technology with an undisclosed number of partners – but Microsoft is not one of those testers.

""Obviously we're right across the street so we would love them to be [a customer],"" Stephens said. ""But we have not deployed there.""

Stephens said he got a phone call from Microsoft this morning after the news broke.

""They said, 'Hey, this is really cool. We didn't know we were doing this.' I said, 'You're not,'"" Stephens said.

Now rumors suggest that the gold and stainless steel editions of the Apple Watch may set consumers back by $5,000 and $500, respectively!

Apple revealed that it would release three collections - Sport Collection, Watch Collection and Edition Collection, which would be composed of aluminum, stainless steel and gold cases, respectively. It was anticipated that the company would have three basic price points, which would vary depending on the band choice and perhaps size.

Now, according to French website iGen.fr, the stainless steel version of the Apple Watch will start at $500, whereas the gold variant of the wearable may start from $4000 to $5000.

""Apple Watch Stainless Steel (polished or black sidereal) would be proposed at $ 500. The Edition model in yellow or pink gold would be sold between $4,000 and $ 5,000 (translated),"" reveals iGen.fr.

The French website cites reliable sources as the basis of its information. iGen.fr has a track record of being dependable as the publication reported the dimensions of the then impending iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6 smartphones from Apple correctly.

Previous estimates from industry experts have pegged the top-end gold Apple Watch's pricing between $1000 and $5000. The Edition Collection will be fashioned from 18K gold and have sapphire crystal. This variant of the Apple Watch will also come with several expensive strap options. Apple, however, has not disclosed whether the chassis of this variant of the Apple Watch is solid gold or simply gold plated.


According to iGen.fr's sources, the Apple Watch will release by Feb. 2015 on Valentine's Day. Both resellers and distributors are fervently preparing for the mid-Feb release of the Apple Watch next year per the site.

Apple SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts' leaked video to employees let slip that the company would release the Apple Watch in Spring next year.

Apple's 12-inch MacBook Air is rumored to feature a new ultrathin design that does away with fans and introduces a revamped trackpad. It may include a low-power Core-M processor and it may be the first device to take advantage of the new reversible USB Type-C connector, which is much smaller and allows a USB cable to be inserted into a notebook in any orientation.

Apple may also use the event to unveil additional details on the Apple Watch, such as pricing and battery life. An event showing off the Apple Watch could explain why Apple has been asking some developers to have their apps ready to launch in the App Store in mid-February, as we reported last week. It's possible that Apple will use apps from these developers to demonstrate additional capabilities of the watch.

Though rumored, a February event is by no means confirmed at this point, and it is unclear what else Apple might cover in addition to the Apple Watch and the 12-inch MacBook Air.

1080,Apple Watch won’t be the digital doctor it could have been,"Before Apple unveiled the Apple Watch last September, reports indicated the device would come with 10 sensors to track health and fitness data, leading some healthcare professionals to find the unveiled Apple Watch's health features disappointing. In a new report, The Wall Street Journal offers a look at the original Apple Watch health features that were dropped due to consistency problems.

Apple began developing the watch about four years ago, with a focus on health and fitness. It’s not unusual for Apple to experiment with many technologies or shift focus during product development, but the watch was especially challenging, people familiar with the matter said. Internally, the project became known as a “black hole” sucking in resources, one of these people said.The Apple Watch originally featured sensors that measured the conductivity of skin, allowing the device to detect stress levels and heart-rate monitoring similar to an electrocardiogram, also known as an EKG. Apple also experimented with ways to detect blood pressure or how much oxygen is in a user's blood. However, a mix of consistency problems and potential oversight caused Apple to switch the focus of the device from health-related to a more general do-everything product.

The skin conductivity features didn't perform well with people who had hairy arms or dry skin, while results varied depending on how tight an Apple Watch was worn on users' wrists. Additionally, if Apple decided to use the health data to provide ""health or behavioral advice"", the Cupertino company would have to seek approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulators.

While these features were dropped for the first version of the Apple Watch, sources tell the WSJ that they could appear in future versions of the device, echoing a Reuters report from September.

Last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company's objective with Apple Watch is to ""change the way people live their lives"" and that people would be surprised by the breadth of what the device can do, which includes activity monitoring, reminding users to stand up after a certain time period, and non-verbal communication with friends. Apple is currently asking developers to have their Apple Watch apps ready by mid-February, with some developers traveling to Apple's Cupertino headquarters for help.

Cook has confirmed the Apple Watch will launch in April. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple will make five to six million units for the first quarter, with half of those units being the entry Apple Watch Sport and one-third being the mid-tier stainless-steel Apple Watch.

So far there's nothing substantiating all the buzz. Cuban media outlets have denied any news conference is scheduled, and the hype also comes ""suspiciously close"" to the actual death of Fidel Castro Odinga, the 41-year-old son of a Kenya opposition leader, as the Daily Mail reports.

1082,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s mystery illness actually two broken ankles, newspaper says","There's a story currently making the rounds about an Australian man who, upon returning from a trip to Bali, discovered that a spider burrowed under his skin and traveled up to his chest. Freaky? Yes, but it's also not plausible.

Rest easy, arachnophobes. You do not have to worry about Charlotte weaving her web beneath your flesh. The supposed story goes like this: Dylan Thomas (a 21-year-old man, not the dead poet) was on vacation in Bali and woke up one morning to discover a red ""trail"" of irritation running from his navel to his chest, a trail that continued to grow longer throughout the day.

Thomas says that, after initially being sent home with antihistamines, he returned to the medical center where doctors discovered a tiny tropical spider beneath his skin. Supposedly, they removed the creature through an incision and placed it in a specimen jar. According to Thomas, his doctors speculated that it had entered his skin through an appendectomy scar and just kept moving up his body. Thomas told various news outlets that he believes the spider was there for three days.

It's the kind of story that has a lot of people saying, ""NOPE,"" and a lot of arachnologists saying simply, ""No, that didn't happen."" Thomas may have been told that a spider invaded his flesh, but the arachnologists we spoke to about this story sincerely doubt that one actually did.

""I think this is extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible,"" Christopher Buddle, associate professor at McGill University's Department of Natural Resource Sciences, told us in an email. ""Simply put: it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might 'crawl beneath skin through a scar'. The claim that it was 'feeding and moving up through the scar tissue' defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders. I am also sceptical because the 'evidence' (the spider itself) is not presented.""

Dr. Charles E. Griswold, Schlinger Curator of Arachnology (Emeritus) at the California Academy of Sciences, said he couldn't comment on this particular incident, but was similarly skeptical. ""[I]n general this is impossible and there is no reason that a spider would do that,"" he wrote.

Could it be that doctors pulled something other than a spider from Thomas' body? Maybe, but we should wait to hear if more information comes out about the specimen. Buddle told us, ""Other arthropods (e.g., ticks/mites/perhaps some insects) could 'possibly' be 'associated' with something like this… perhaps... But certainly not a spider.""

Marie Herberstein, Head of the Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University in New South Wales, doesn't fully exclude the possibility that this could be a spider, though she writes, ""I have never heard of any spider to crawl or exist under the skin or integument of any other creature (there are no parasites amongst spiders)."" But she also suspects it may be a different animal. She told us, ""My initial reaction is that this is a mite (also 8-legged) rather than a spider, and mites are renown[ed] for this type of behaviour, such as in scabies. Let's see what the identification brings.""

The British Isis militant known as Jihadi John has been identified in reports today as Mohammed Emwazi, from London.

In a lengthy article by The Washington Post, identifying the man suspected of appearing in videos showing the beheading of US and UK hostages, a 2010 report in The Independent is cited, which details claims that Emwazi was detained for 'days' and illegally interrogated by MI5 while on a safari holiday in Africa, before being let go.

It has now been claimed Emwazi started to become radicalised following the events on this trip.

Below is the full report, in which Emwazi is identified as Muhammad ibn Muazzam, from The Independent on Saturday, 01 May, 2010.

British Muslims on safari 'stopped by MI5' (from The Independent on 01/05/2010)

MI5 agents illegally interrogated British Muslims who were detained while on safari holidays in Africa, it was claimed yesterday.

The new allegations mirror cases first raised by The Independent last year in which the security service was accused of harassing and intimidating north London community workers who had returned from Somalia.

Now two British men from west London who visited Tanzania for a week-long safari in May last year say they were arrested and held for “days” in inhumane detention on the orders of MI5.

Abu Talib and Muhammad ibn Muazzam, both in their mid-20s, and a German friend travelling with them, allege they were threatened with beatings by members of Tanzania's security forces. After being refused entry to Tanzania they were returned to the Netherlands, where they say they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists.

On their return to the UK the next day, the men allege they were harassed by MI5, who warned them they were now on a terror watch list which prevented them travelling to any Muslim country. Another British citizen, Abu Omar, 19, says that in April 2009 his safari holiday to Kenya was interrupted when the house in which he was staying was raided by local security officers.

Mr Omar claims he was held and questioned for four days, also on the basis of intelligence supplied by MI5. He alleges that his interrogators threw a mobile phone at him which they said had his fingerprints on and was linked to phone calls made to Osama bin Laden. Back in London Mr Omar was further questioned by MI5, who took his fingerprints and photographs.

He told the human rights group Cageprisoners: ""I was left in the airport without money, barefoot and my clothes in bin liners.""

The new cases bear striking similarities to allegations made by six youth workers from Kentish Town who allege that they too were harassed and unlawfully interrogated after holidays abroad in 2008. Cageprisoners' executive director, Asim Qureshi, said: ""The last seven years of the 'War on Terror' have seen the profiling and criminalisation of the Arab and Pakistani communities by UK authorities around the world. The policies implemented through counter-terrorism legislation and Prevent [the Government's strategy for combating extremism in the Muslim community] have been counter-productive as Muslim communities feel marginalised. Many Muslims feel besieged and the policies of Government have done nothing to temper that.""

1085,Kim Jong-un 'set to open a new restaurant in SCOTLAND',"LONDON — The North Korean embassy in London has denied  reports on Scottish media sites on Monday that it is planning to open an state-backed restaurant in Scotland.

""I think that is fabricated, it’s nonsense,"" a spokesman in the North Korean embassy in London told Mashable.

North Korea Leadership Watch's editor Michael Madden, who is a frequent visitor to the communist state, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

""It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland,"" he said, according to the Daily Record. ""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite's thoughts. Despite voting 'no,' they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.""

In September, Choe Kwan-il, managing editor of pro-North Korea newspaper Chonson Sinbo, told The Telegraph that North Korea has quietly endorsed Scottish independence.

""I believe that every person has the right to be a member of an independent nation, to have sovereignty, to live in peace and to enjoy equality,"" Choe said. ""And I believe that a majority of Scots feel the same and will vote for independence.""

North Korea has restaurants in parts of Asia as well as one branch in Amsterdam, which are used to funnel foreign currency back into the regime's treasury. The restaurants have existed for years in parts of China, while expansion to other parts of Asia began in the early 2000s.

1086,Comcast Says You Can Keep Your Tor,"Multiple users of anonymous web browser Tor have reported that Comcast has threatened to cut off their internet service unless they stop using the legal software.

According to a report on Deepdotweb, Comcast customer representatives have branded Tor ""illegal"" and told customers that using it is against the company's policies.

Tor is a type of web browser that, in theory, makes all your internet activity private. The software routes traffic through a series of other connected internet users, making it difficult for governments and private companies to monitor your internet usage. Up to 1.2 million people use the browser, which became especially popular after Edward Snowden leaked information showing that the NSA was eavesdropping on ordinary citizens. Prior to that, Tor had been popular among people transacting business on Silk Road, the online market for drugs and hitmen.

The problem is that downloading or using Tor itself isn't illegal. Plenty of people might have legitimate reasons to want to surf the web in private, without letting others know what they were looking at. But Tor has been pretty popular with criminals.

Comcast has reportedly begun telling users that it is an ""illegal service."" One Comcast representative, identified only as Kelly, warned a customer over his use of Tor software, DeepDotWeb reports:

Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.

Comcast customers, speaking to Deepdotweb, claimed that Comcast repeatedly asked them which sites they were accessing using Tor.

In a statement to Deepdotweb, Comcast defended its actions, seemingly asserting that it needs to be able to monitor internet traffic in case they receive a court order:

We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customer’s account with a valid court order. And if we’re asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.

It’s Almost Definitely Fake","In further trouble for Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, head of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda, Punjab and Haryana High Court has ordered a CBI probe into the allegations of forced castration of his followers inside the ashram. Justice K Kannan of the High Court passed the order on a petition filed by Hansraj Chauhan, a former follower of the Dera.

In his petition, Chauhan had claimed that he along with around 400 saints of 'dera' were castrated inside the ashram, Chauhan's counsel Navkiran Singh said.

Chauhan said in the petition that they were assured that those who would get castrated will be able to meet God through the dera head.

Taking cognizance of the petition, the HC had earlier ordered medical examination of petitioner Chuahan from the government multi-specialty hospital (GMSH) at Sector-16, Chandigarh.

The GMSH authorities examined Chauhan and found that he has been castrated, Singh said.

Seeking a CBI probe, Chauhan has also claimed before the High Court that castration process of dera followers is being done by Gurmeet Ram Rahim through doctors are employed in his hospital.

Besides, in a report submitted before the High Court, the state government said that it has recorded the statements of seven persons, associated with the dera head, in which all of them have confirmed that they have been castrated, Singh said.

1090,US confirms death of Somalia terror group leader,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Friday confirmed the death of the leader of the al-Shabab terror group, Ahmed Abdi Godane, who was the target of a U.S. airstrike Monday in Somalia.

The Pentagon’s press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, confirmed the death in a brief written statement. President Barack Obama, speaking at the conclusion of a NATO summit in Newport, Wales, said the successful U.S. strike was an example of his administration’s determination to hit back at terrorists.

Obama said the U.S. would use the same approach in degrading the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.

“We have been very systematic and methodical in going after these kind of organizations” that threaten U.S. personnel and the homeland, Obama said. “That deliberation allows us to do it right, but have no doubt: We will continue to do what is necessary to protect the American people.”

The White House declared a counterterrorism success.

“Godane’s removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al-Qaida affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals,” a White House statement said.

“Even as this is an important step forward in the fight against al-Shabab, the United States will continue to use the tools at our disposal – financial, diplomatic, intelligence and military – to address the threat that al-Shabab and other terrorist groups pose to the United States and the American people.” It added.

U.S. officials had said after the strike on Monday that U.S. special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions. But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday.

The State Department declared al-Shabab a terrorist organization in February 2008.

Kirby said on Tuesday, before the Pentagon was certain that Godane had died, that the U.S. strike was conducted south of Mogadishu and that it had destroyed the vehicle that was targeted. He noted that in September 2013, Godone had publicly claimed al-Shabab was responsible for the deadly Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya.

“Under the leadership of Godane, al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for many bombings, including suicide attacks in Mogadishu and in central and northern Somalia, typically targeting officials and perceived allies of the federal government of Somalia, as well as the former transitional federal government of Somali,” Kirby said Tuesday.",agree
1091,Banksy arrest hoax: Internet duped by fake report claiming that the street artist's identity has been revealed,"DNA tests confirm Lebanon is holding the young daughter of Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the country's interior minister says.

Nohad Machnouk told Lebanon's MTV television that the child's mother, who is also in custody, was now believed to be one of Baghdadi's ex-wives.

On Tuesday, Lebanese security officials said they had detained his wife and son at a border crossing with Syria.

But Iraq's government later insisted the woman was not married to Baghdadi.

It said the woman - identified as Saja al-Dulaimi - was the daughter of an active member of al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, al-Nusra Front.

She is also thought to have been detained by the Syrian authorities before being freed in March as part of a prisoner exchange with al-Nusra.

Pregnant

Late on Wednesday, Mr Machnouk told MTV that Ms Dulaimi had been travelling with two sons and a daughter when they were detained by the army two weeks ago.

""Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,"" he said.

""Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child.""

The minister added: ""We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is [Baghdadi's] daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq.""

It is not clear how the Iraqi authorities have the IS leader's DNA. However, in 2005 he was arrested by US forces in Iraq and spent the next four years a prisoner at Camp Bucca, near the southern town of Um Qasr, before being handed over to the Iraqi authorities and then released.

Mr Machnouk said Ms Dulaimi's children were staying at a care centre while she was being interrogated at the defence ministry's headquarters.

IS has not commented on their detention, but al-Nusra has condemned it.

1092,Lawmaker Says ‘At Least 10′ Islamic State Fighters Have Been Captured at the Southern U.S. Border,"While laptop sales continue to drop, Apple's MacBook Air has managed to remain popular and perform well. This year, Apple is set to launch a 12-inch MacBook Air, which could just be Apple's biggest product in 2015.

After being rumored for quite some time, the new laptop from Apple has just been confirmed by the latest report from Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac. Apple has made a number of changes in the MacBook Air, removing and redesigning what users know and love about the machine.

""Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots,"" said Gurman.

The new 12-inch MacBook Air is said to be smaller than its 13-inch sibling and a bit thinner than the 11-inch version. It is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller than the latter, which allows it to keep a slightly bigger display. The bezels around the display have also been reduced, giving the front part of the machine a brand new look.

Much of the larger proportion of the machine's usable area will be occupied by the display panel and the keyboard. Apple has noticeably deviated from the standard keyboard of the MacBook Air by cramming the keys in order to decrease the spaces in between.

Other key changes include the transferring of the power button from the upper left-hand corner to the left side of the escape key and the removal of the travel on the track pad as a way to keep the laptop's slim build.

The new MacBook Air is also a minimalist when it comes to ports as it will only be sporting two, namely the headphone jack and a USB Type-C port. This means that fans of the machine will have to do away with the Thunderbolt connection and the MagSafe charger.

However, the specs of the new USB indicate that the Type-C can support driving displays and device charging.

""The new USB Type-C connector is smaller, faster, and more capable than the standard USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports on existing computers,"" added Gurman.

Apple is yet to make an official announcement on the new MacBook Air. The laptop is speculated to ship in mid-2015 and is expected to use one of the new dual-core Broadwell chips from Intel.",unrelated
1093,"Six months after abducting Nigerian schoolgirls, Boko Haram reportedly wants to free them","Although Canadian police have not released the name of the Ottawa shooter, on Wednesday afternoon U.S. sources leaked that the suspect’s name is Michael Zehaf Bibeau, a 32-year-old Canadian who was a recent convert to Islam.

Mr. Bibeau’s name was first broadcast by CBS, allegedly via U.S. intelligence sources who had been in contact with their Canadian counterparts.

The suspect—who was reportedly born and raised in Quebec—has a lengthy criminal past in Montreal, Aylmer, QC and British Columbia.

A Zehaf-Bibeau resided in Montreal’s Villeray-Saint Michel-Park Extension borough between 2004 and 2006.

His most recent court record indicates Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau fell off the map for three years, as far as the Montreal courthouse was concerned, because he failed to show up in court on a simple marijuana charge that had been filed against him on March 14, 2006.

Parliament shooting

He turned up in court more than three years later, on Dec. 12, 2009, to plead guilty to the charge. As part of his sentence he was granted an absolute discharge. (Under that charge the man was charged and convicted under the name Michael Bibeau-Zehaf.)

His most serious conviction came on Dec. 7, 2004, when Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau pleaded guilty to possession of phencyclidine, also known as PCP, and was sentenced to a 60-day prison term.

On the same day, he also pleaded guilty to marijuana possession and was sentenced to one day in prison. He has also been convicted for failing to comply with conditions of a release.

In court records related to another charge for breach of conditions, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau listed his address as being in Aylmer, QC, a city of 40,000 just 23 minutes west of Downtown Ottawa.

And, just two years ago, Mr. Bibeau was on the West Coast.




According to British Columbia Court records, a “Michael Joseph Paul Zehaf Bibeau” committed robbery in Vancouver on December 16, 2011, and also racked up a lesser charge of uttering threats.

As of Tuesday evening, Vancouver Police were working with Ottawa law enforcement to pass on information about the suspect’s time in B.C.

“The Vancouver Police Department, along with the BC RCMP, are working together to assist an Ottawa City Police and RCMP National Security investigation,” wrote Vancouver Police spokesman Randy Fincham late Wednesday afternoon. “Due to the ongoing investigation, there is little information we can share at this time,” he added.

Citing confidential sources, the Globe and Mail reported Tuesday that Mr. Bibeau was a “high-risk traveller” whose passport had been seized to prevent him from travelling abroad to join ISIS fighters in Iraq or Syria.

On Tuesday, the RCMP confirmed that Martin Rouleau, the man accused of running over two Canadian Forces soldiers in Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu, had been one of 90 suspects under similar observation.

Nevertheless, as of Tuesday the RCMP had not confirmed that they had been monitoring Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau.

Unlike other Canadian homegrown terrorist suspects, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau had no obvious web presence: No Twitter account, no Facebook page, and no Jihadist scrawls in random blogs or YouTube comment sections.

Witnesses say they saw Bibeau wearing a black coat with blue jeans, according to the CBC. The same report says gun used in the attack was a double-barrel shotgun.

Although, if the example of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu terrorist suspect Martin Rouleau is any indication, he may have changed his name following his conversion to Islam.

Before he allegedly ran over two Canadian soldiers in the parking lot of a Service Canada location, Mr. Rouleau reportedly changed his name to Ahmad LeConverti (Ahmad The Converted).

Although there are no Zehafs listed in Canadian phone books, the name Bibeau is common throughout Quebec.

On Wednesday, Quebecer Michaël Bideau noted on his Facebook page that he shared virtually the same name and birth year of the alleged shooter.

Dylan Thomas, 21, was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach

Dr Volker Framenau, an Archaeologist, says: 'If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin'

Dylan Thomas was travelling in Bali earlier this month when he suffered from 'a really burning sensation like a searing feeling' in his stomach.

He claimed he sought medical attention, at which point a dermatologist removed a 'tropical spider' from his stomach with tweezers.

The Age have spoken with a number of local scientists who claim to have debunked the 'Bunbury Spiderman' story which went viral on Thursday, and was shared thousands of time around the world.

Dr Volker Framenau, an Archaeologist from the Department of Terrestrial Zoology in Western Australia, said: 'If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin.'

Dr Framenau said it was much more likely the animal was mite, as some of these can resemble a spider.

He said if the creature had been collected, there would be less confusion as what it actually was, and would prevent the spread of a possible virus.

Dr Mark Harvey, the Senior Curator of Arachnology at the West Australian Museum, said he had never heard of spiders being able to survive beneath the skin of any mammal

Dr Harvey said spiders would suffocate if they burrowed inside human skin: 'Spiders need air to breathe. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive'

Dr Mark Harvey, the Senior Curator of Arachnology at the West Australian Museum, said he had never heard of spiders being able to survive beneath the skin of any mammal.

'Spiders need air to breathe, they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive,' he told The Age.

Harvey said the fear most people have of spiders fuels urban myths from those hoping to instil fear.

The group, which has seized swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria.

U.S-led forces are bombing Islamic State bases in Syria and Iraq. The group has regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and has overrun several military bases but, if the report is confirmed, this would be the first time it has been able to pilot warplanes.

""They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,"" Abdulrahman said.

""People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,"" he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 km (45 miles) south of the Turkish border.

Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the Observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report.

It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military.

U.S. MILITARY KEEPING ""CLOSE EYE""

""We're not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,"" U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said, using a former name for Islamic State.

""We continue to keep a close eye on (Islamic State) activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centres of gravity, wherever they may be.""

General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State.

""We don’t have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I don’t have any information on that either,"" he told a Pentagon news briefing.

Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria but the aircraft appeared unusable, according to political analysts and diplomats.

The countryside east of Aleppo city is one of the main bases of Islamic State in Syria. The al Qaeda offshoot controls up to a third of the territory of Syria, whose civil war pitting various rebel groups against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has raged for more than three years.

Nigeria's president has been criticised at home and abroad for his slow response to the abducted and for his inability to quell the violence by the group, seen as the biggest security threat to Africa's biggest economy.

Reports that Isis fighters in Iraq have contracted Ebola have been refuted as “incorrect” and “unfounded” by the country’s health ministry.

Despite reports on Wednesday in the Iraqi paper, al-Sabah, that two cases of Ebola had been reported in Mosul in the north of the country, Ahmed Rudaini, the health ministry’s spokesman dismissed the speculation.

He said the disease could not have been registered, as only the Central Laboratory of Public Health in Baghdad has the “diagnostic capabilities” to confirm cases of Ebola which was reported by the al-Maalomah news website and the International Business Times.

The World Health Organisation also confirmed that they had received no confirmation of Ebola cases from Iraq.

Tarik Jasarevic from the organisation told The Independent: ""WHO is aware of these reports and is working closely with Iraqi MoH to get more information.

""It is unlikely that this case can be a confirmed Ebola case as there is no laboratory facility in Mosul that could do an Ebola test.""

WHO’s director of communications, Christy Feig had earlier told Mashable: “We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.”

The organisation has reached out to the Iraqi government to investigate the claims, should it require assistance, however.

Al-Sabah initially reported that “terrorists” from several unnamed African countries had brought the virus to the country and claimed that two cases of Ebola and 26 cases of HIV/AIDS had been registered by authorities.

Although Isis has recruited foreign fighters in the past, it believed that the majority came from Tunisia, according to a Washington Post report. Very few, if any, militants are thought to have travelled from at-risk areas of West Africa, including Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

1099,"Boko Haram leader denies ceasefire deal, says 200 abducted girls married off ","A Catholic priest from Massachusetts had been dead for 48 minutes before he was miraculously resuscitated. However, it is his description about God that is bound to spark a hot debate about the almighty.

Father John Michael O’Neal was officially declared dead for more than 48 minutes, but medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. According to the 71-year-old man of God, the supreme entity isn’t a man, as is popularly assumed and believed. Father O’Neal claims he met God during the brief time he was officially dead and God is a woman.

The catholic father claims God is a warm and comforting motherly figure. The revelation will undoubtedly have a profound bearing on the teachings of Christianity, which firmly believes and even implies that God is a male figure who has watched over us with love and devotion. Though the love and devotion part is corroborated by Father O’Neal, he differs from the church’s teachings about the gender of God.

Father John Micheal O’neal had the chance to meet with the divine when he was rushed to a hospital late last month owing to a massive heart attack. However, Father O’Neal was declared clinically dead shortly after his arrival. Not one to give up hope so easily, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital kept the blood flowing to his brain with the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2.

While the blood flowed with the help of modern science, doctors worked tirelessly to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm. Consistent with near-death experiences, Father O’Neal entered heaven through a gate made of bright light and encountered God. However, instead of the all-mighty father figure, the priest claims he was warmly greeted by a motherly figure. Father O’Neal describes the divine entity as “mother-like ‘Being of Light.'”

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting. She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

As expected, the priest’s claims about the gender of God has created quite a stir amidst devote Catholics. The intense discussion between the catholic clergy of the archdiocese about the “experience” of the father and the ramifications of his revelations persuaded the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.

Though his superiors have disapproved, Father O’Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother.”

1100,Macaulay Culkin Dead: Internet Death Hoax Claims Actor Found Dead In Apartment,"Apple’s next-generation MacBook Air, which is expected to come with a 12-inch screen, will have a “radically new design” that will abandon traditional specifications to produce a noticeably thinner and lighter device compared to the current 11-inch model, according to a report.

The upcoming MacBook Air is expected to be about a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, while also sporting a quarter-of-an-inch taller body in order to incorporate the slightly larger display, 9to5Mac reported, citing “sources within Apple” with access to “internal prototype versions” of the device. The bezels on the display could also be narrowed out on all sides to get a larger display fitted into the footprint, which is about the same size as the current 11-inch version's.

In addition to the 12-inch screen, the new MacBook Air could also feature an edge-to-edge keyboard with a redesigned key set, allowing each key to sit closer together, the report said, adding that the move is said to be aimed at making the computer as compact as possible.

The new model could also feature a revamped trackpad with the same width as that found on the 11-inch version, but with a taller frame almost touching the bottom of the keyboard, 9to5Mac reported, adding that the new trackpad may come without the clicking effect found on existing MacBook models.

Just above the keyboard of the next-generation MacBook Air, there could be four new speaker grilles that are expected to also function as ventilation ports, as the device lacks traditional computer fans.

In a bid to achieve a significantly thinner form factor, the 12-inch MacBook Air could do away with standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards in favor of a single USB Type-C port, which is reportedly smaller, faster and better than the existing USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports. In addition, the USB Type-C port is reversible, similar to that of the Lightning connector on the latest iOS devices. While the new USB Type-C port will sit on the left side of the device, the right side will accommodate the headphone jack, along with input and noise-canceling microphones, according to the report.

The details of the 12-inch MacBook Air closely follow recent rumors that the device could enter mass production in the first quarter of 2015. According to a report from Taiwan’s DigiTimes in December, Apple’s suppliers were stocking up inventory of related components for the new MacBook Air, in anticipation of the device entering production.",unrelated
1101,Rumors of ISIS leader's death debunked,"Oscar-winner Christian Bale, who has played Batman and Moses, is about to take on another iconic figure: Steve Jobs.

Sources confirm the actor is in talks to star in “Jobs,” Sony’s biopic about the late Apple co-founder.

Based on Walter Isaacson’s biography “Steve Jobs,” the real-life drama is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin.

Scott Rudin will produce along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady.

Sorkin has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple’s famous product launches.

“The first one being the Mac,” he told the Daily Beast. “The second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple. And the third one being the iPod.”

“It’s a little like writing about the Beatles,” he added. “There are so many people out there that know him and revere him.”

Leonardo DiCaprio had been circling the role but eventually passed to take time off from acting. David Fincher had also been in talks at one point to direct.

Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul’s death in 2011.

Bale, who can next be seen in Ridley Scott’s “Exodus: Gods and Kings,” is still negotiating for the Travis McGee pic “The Deep Blue Goodbye” at Fox. Sources tell Variety talks have taken longer then expected because Bale was not interested in doing a sequel to “Deep Blue” while Fox wanted one.

Insiders say Bale would likely shoot “Jobs” in the spring and follow it up with ‘The Deep Blue Goodbye.”

1102,Questions raised over Nicaragua 'meteorite',"Apple would never lower itself to rubbing elbows with the unwashed masses at CES, but it does like to throw out a few announcements during the show to get under everyone’s skin. Cupertino has been quiet thus far, but rumors are swirling about a 12-inch MacBook Air refresh, and this isn’t just a spec bump. Apple is reportedly redesigning the iconic laptop to be even thinner with a higher resolution screen.
Sources inside the company who have used the prototype notebook (code named MacBook Stealth) say it will eschew many of the conventional laptop features in the name of advancing design. The current MacBook Air’s taper toward the front edge, which gives them a very slim profile, but there’s still space near the back for the power connector and full-sized USBs. The new Air, however, won’t be thick enough for a USB port. Instead, Apple will start using the new type-c reversible connectors. There also won’t be an SD card slot or a MagSafe power connector–even Apple’s beloved Thunderbolt is taking a hike. USB will do it all.
MBA
The 12-inch laptop would be substantially smaller and lighter than the 13-inch model, and even slightly smaller than the 11-inch version. This is thanks to slimmer bezels and a slightly more compact keyboard with less separate between keys. 9to5Mac doesn’t have details on exactly how high the resolution will be, but the current Airs are sitting at 1366 x 768 (11-inch) and 1440 x 900 (13-inch). Stepping it up to a Retina Display resolution of 2560 x 1600 (like the 13-inch Pro) would be amazing in the Air’s form factor.
profilel-r-copy
To be clear, all the images of this supposed notebook are renders created by 9to5Mac. This is still thoroughly in the rumor category, but it’s a redesign we’ve been expecting for a long time. The updated MacBook Air could be announced in mid-2015.

1103,"Managua explosion not a meteorite, NASA suggests","A previously unverified audio recording that allegedly captures the final moments of Michael Brown’s life has been verified as authentic, according to the video streaming application it was recorded on.

A resident living in the apartment complex where Brown was killed was using a video messaging app called Glide at the time of the shooting and unwittingly captured the sound of gunfire, according to a lawyer representing the resident, whose identity has not been released.

The recording suggests nearly a dozen shots were fired in an altercation between Brown, who was unarmed at the time, and Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

According to Glide the recording was created at 12:02 p.m. CT on Saturday Aug. 9, precisely the time police say Brown was shot.

“A Glide user living nearby (whose identity is being protected) was simply using the Glide app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed – to instantly communicate with a friend through our real-time video texting service. Simultaneously, they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown,” Glide said in a statement released on Thursday. “Because Glide is the only messaging application using streaming video technology, each message is simultaneously recorded and transmitted, so the exact time can be verified to the second.”

The lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, said she has shared the recording with the FBI. Federal officials won’t confirm they have this specific recording, but do confirm they are collecting any audio and video of the incident. 

The audio could prove to be critical piece of evidence in the ongoing investigation into Brown’s death. It also seems to confirm what some witnesses to the shooting say happened during the incident.

They said Brown, who was black, and Wilson, who is white, were seen struggling through the driver’s side window of Wilson’s police car. They said Wilson fired a single shot from inside his car and then fired several more as Brown attempted to flee. Some witnesses, viewing the incident from different vantage points, have said Wilson fired several shots at Brown and that at some point the boy turned around with his hands up, at which point Wilson fired several more gunshots.

The audio does not capture what happened just moments before or after the shooting. And law enforcement officials say that at this stage it’s impossible to know what the significance of this tape may be.

Days before the release of the audio earlier this week, Tommy Chatman-Bey, who lives in the Canefield Green Apartment complex near where Brown was killed, told msnbc that he was outside at the time of the shooting and was an ear-witness.

“I was right out there when I heard it,” Chatman-Bey said. “I heard Boom, Boom, Boom, pause, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom and then some more.”

The police have not provided many details about the shooting and have not released a detailed police incident report. What Ferguson police have released is a report with little more than the date, time and location of the incident. But more curious are the time stamps on the document. Typically an incident report following a homicide would give a detailed account.

The report, released only after the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri sued under open records law, suggests a supervisor had not reviewed it until Aug. 19, 10 days after the fatal shooting. Final sign-off wasn’t given until Aug. 20, the report appears to indicate.

Glide in their statement said, “While tragedy is never good news, and our hearts go out to the family of Michael Brown, this incident underscores how technology is changing the landscape of not only journalism, but also criminology. We commend this Glide user for turning their Glide video message over to FBI investigators as possible evidence in this ongoing investigation.”

A key question could be why Wilson paused in the midst of the barrage.

Brown was struck with at least six bullets including two that hit his skull, according to an autopsy performed at the behest of Brown’s family. Lawyers for Brown’s family have been critical of what forensic examiners identified as the two head shots that actually killed Brown. At least one of the shots struck Brown at the top of his head. Witnesses claim that as Brown fell to his knees and attempted to surrender to Wilson that the officer continued to walk toward him, firing several more shots.

St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch began presenting evidence in the case to a grand jury last week and said a decision on whether or not Wilson will be charged may not come until October.",unrelated
1104,Terrorism fears rise amid reports of stolen jetliners,"Reports that 11 commercial jetliners are missing from the main airport in Libya's capital of Tripoli are raising fears that militants could use them in terrorist attacks to mark the 13th anniversary of 9/11 next week.

The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news website, cited anonymous sources who said intelligence agencies have warned the jets could be used in attacks in North Africa and elsewhere on Sept. 11.

The date also marks the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said, ""We have nothing to confirm these reports about missing airliners.""

A spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, Bernadette Meehan, also said there's been no confirmation that aircraft had been stolen.

Images have surfaced online showing militants posing with the jetliners taken when the militants overran Tripoli's airport last month in a fierce battle that left much of the airport and its aircraft damaged.

In the past four months, a renegade general has battled Islamic militants in the eastern city of Benghazi — cradle of the 2011 uprising that toppled Moammar Gadhafi — as powerful regional militias have fought for control of the Tripoli airport. Islamist-allied militias have seized virtually all of the capital.

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui said there was ""credible intelligence"" that one Libyan militia ""is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the (region) on the 9/11 anniversary,"" The Huffington Post reported, citing Al Jazeera television.

An aviation security expert said the planes, if actually seized by terrorists, would pose more of a threat to countries near Libya than the U.S. homeland.

Any stolen aircraft from Libya would unlikely penetrate post-9/11 U.S. air defense and security measures, but they could pose a threat to targets that are much closer, said Jeffrey Price, author of Practical Aviation Security and professor at Metropolitan State University in Denver.

Airliners are required to file flight plans before entering U.S. airspace, and air-traffic monitors would be looking for aircraft matching the description of any stolen planes, Price said. An airliner could try to fly below radar to avoid detection, but the U.S. military has developed systems to detect and stop low flying threats, he said.

Price said most countries near Libya, including in Europe, do not have the same air-defense capabilities and would be more at risk.

The reports of the missing planes, which first surfaced in mid-August, likely sparked an international search for the planes by intelligence agencies, Price said. ""It's hard to hide a big jet,"" he said.

The latest report surfaced after an Islamist militia seized a U.S. Embassy residence in Tripoli last weekend, posting video online of men playing in a pool at the compound. In late July, U.S. diplomats evacuated the compound and the capital and traveled to neighboring Tunisia under a U.S. military escort as fighting between rival militias intensified and thousands fled.

About 150,000 people have fled Libya during the fighting and another 100,000 have been internally displaced, according to a United Nations report released Thursday.

IS has held him ever since, but today they tweeted out video of his beheading.

They want publicity from this barbaric act, and I’m loathe to give it to them even by writing a few words about it.

But their barbarity needs to be exposed.

President Obama is reluctant to do anything about the Islamic State’s spread, other than to order airstrikes. Over the past few days, those airstrikes have helped the Kurdish and Iraqi forces fight IS. Iraqi forces recaptured the strategic Mosul dam.

They are still capturing Iraqi Christians and Yazidis and reportedly selling captured women into sex slavery. They are murdering people by the dozens, by the hundreds.

The supply package was apparently one of many intended for Kurdish fighters who have been battling ISIS militants for control of the strategically important town for weeks. The footage has not been independently verified.

According to Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby, the majority of supplies were safely delivered to Kurdish forces, which have been supported by a U.S.-led coalition as they defend the town.

1112,Microsoft Hires Dalek-style Robocops to Guard Silicon Valley HQ,"Militants with the Islamic State jihadi group have released a video that appears to show the beheading of a British hostage, David Haines, an aid worker who was captured just days after he arrived in Syria last year.

British government officials were seeking to authenticate the video which purported to show the final moments of Haines, who was 44.

In the video, entitled A Message to the Allies of America, a masked man is shown carrying out the beheading of Haines, whose life had earlier been threatened in a film showing the murder of American journalist Steven Sotloff. The video, which runs to two minutes and 28 seconds, ends with a warning that a second British hostage would be the next to die. He has been named in international media and on social media as Alan Henning, a British aid worker.

Haines is the third western hostage and the first Briton to be killed in this fashion by Isis – the first, US journalist James Foley, was murdered in a video released on 19 August.

The British prime minister, David Cameron, issued a statement denouncing the killing. “This is a despicable and appalling murder of an innocent aid worker. It is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal.

“We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.”

Cameron will gather senior representatives of the military and security services and the Foreign Office and Home Office in Whitehall to discuss the situation.

The US president, Barack Obama, also condemned the killing. “The United States strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group Isil,” he said, using his administration’s preferred acronym for Isis. “Our hearts go out to the family of Mr Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom.

“The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve. We will work with the UK and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world.”

The recording features a voiceover delivered by an Isis militant, whose voice and accent closely resembles that of the killer in both the Sotloff and Foley videos. The killer directly addresses Cameron, saying that Haines “has to pay the price for your promise” to arm Kurdish peshmerga fighters against Isis.

Speaking to the camera, the hostage, composed but clearly under duress, and wearing an orange jumpsuit, reads out a statement in which he says that Cameron is “entirely responsible for my execution” for entering into a coalition with the US.

Haines, who was in the Royal Air Force for 12 years before moving into aid work, addresses Cameron, saying: “You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State, just as your predecessor, Tony Blair, did, following a trend amongst our British prime ministers who can’t find the courage to say no to the Americans.

“Unfortunately, it is we, the British public, that will in the end pay the price for our parliament’s selfish decisions.”

The killer, swathed in black, then makes a statement in which he makes a direct reference to the British government’s aid to Kurdish fighters.

He says: “This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State. Ironically, he has spent a decade of his life serving under the same Royal Air Force that is responsible for delivering those arms.

“Your evil alliance with America which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha dam will only accelerate your destruction. And playing the role of the obedient lapdog, Cameron, will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war.”

At the end of the latest video, another hostage, Henning, is paraded.

The US carried out at least nine air strikes last week on Isis militants threatening the Haditha dam. The bombing was cited by Haines’s killer in the video.

A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office in London said: “We are aware of the video and are working urgently to verify the contents.”

Isis had threatened to kill Haines, a father of two, in a video that emerged 11 days ago in which Sotloff was murdered. Less than 24 hours before the latest video emerged, the Haines family had made a plea to the jihadis to respond to their efforts to make contact.

The family statement, which was released by the Foreign Office and addressed the militants directly, said: “We are the family of David Haines. We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.”

Haines was born in East Yorkshire but raised in Perthshire, and before his capture was living in Croatia with his second wife Dragana.

He had a 17-year-old daughter with his first wife Louise, and a four-year-old daughter with Dragana, who has described him as a “fantastic man and father”. He was kidnapped while working for the aid organisation Acted, having previously worked in Libya and South Sudan.

A meeting of the British government’s emergency committee, Cobra, is expected to be called imminently and the prime minister’s attentions will be diverted from the referendum on Scottish independence, due to take place on Thursday.

Haines had worked for aid agencies in some of the world’s worst trouble spots, including Libya and South Sudan.

1113,Saddam Hussein’s pilots training Islamic State group,"When Apple introduced its Apple Watch in September, the company said there would be three editions along with various face options and bands. Customers will literally have dozens of watch configurations to choose from. Only the base model got an official price of $349, however. Now a report claims to have pricing information on other editions.

MacRumors spotted a French blog whose sources suggest the stainless steel Apple Watch variant will start at $500 while gold models could cost $4,000 and up. The iGen blog has been credible in the past, correctly predicting the size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

If you take the view that Apple Watch is simply another smartwatch or gadget, the prices may not make that much sense. Look at the device as a fashion statement with smarts, though, and the anticipated costs sound viable. Apple has designed the watch and will market it as a modern timepiece that adds smartwatch functions to your wrist. It’s already considered a luxury brand by many and people are clearly willing to pay premium prices for that brand.

The stainless steel pricing is certainly believable to me. Look at Pebble to see why.

Pebble Steel fashion

 


You can buy a plastic Pebble smartwatch for as little as $99 now, recently discounted from its $149 price. The same watch and functionality in a more aesthetically pleasing stainless steel case will cost you $199, or double the plastic model’s price. It’s reasonable to assume an Apple Watch with stainless steel casing will cost $500 based on that. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see that come with a leather strap, with an additional $50 to $100 cost for a matching stainless steel strap.

Unfortunately, we’re not likely to know the official retail costs until this coming spring, as Apple won’t be selling the Apple Watch until then. For now, potential customers have time to save up for Apple’s timepiece — something they may need to do if they want an Apple Watch in gold.",unrelated

This self-contradiction was encapsulated in the suspension of Bill Simmons for opining on what ESPN’s own reporting had concluded about the NFL.

In that spirit, ESPN will feature Monday night a Deep Meaningful on domestic violence (not the network’s first). But per Esquire’s Ben Collins:

The panel for that discussion will include the following people: Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Stuart Scott, Steve Young and Ray Lewis. Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24. When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they’ll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber. These people are not allowed at the table.

Collins reads this as part of a widespread practice at ESPN of marginalizing female voices, a tendency that enables the network to submit to the powerful league at the moments when it most needs its editorial independence. Read the full piece.

1116,Here Are Microsoft's New Robot Security Guards,"Islamic State group fighters seized at least one cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town, activists said today.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

A still from an Islamic State (ISIS) video, purportedly shows an IS militant displaying the content of a crate carrying grenades near the town of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey border

A U.S. military airdrop of weapons meant for Kurdish fighters fell into the hands of their jihadist foes near the Syrian battleground town of Kobane, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said

The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

On Tuesday, ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.'

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.

An American journalist has been killed in a car crash in Turkey just days after claiming she claimed the Turkish intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of Kobane.

Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'.

Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles.

Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'

Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network.

In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place.

Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally.

Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene.

Death: Serena Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying

Only last Friday Shim was interviewed on camera by Press TV about her fears of being arrested by Turkish intelligence agencies.

In the short interview she alleged that she had been approached and accused of spying after a report in which he said she claimed to have received images of Islamic State terrorists being smuggled over the Turkey-Syria in vehicles belonging to the World Food Organization and other aid groups.

Shim described herself as 'surprised' at the accusation, 'because I have nothing to hide and I have never done anything aside my job.'",unrelated

Cupertino has been quiet thus far, but rumors are swirling about a 12-inch MacBook Air refresh, and this isn’t just a spec bump. Apple is reportedly redesigning the iconic laptop to be even thinner with a higher resolution screen.
Sources inside the company who have used the prototype notebook (code named MacBook Stealth) say it will eschew many of the conventional laptop features in the name of advancing design. The current MacBook Air’s taper toward the front edge, which gives them a very slim profile, but there’s still space near the back for the power connector and full-sized USBs. The new Air, however, won’t be thick enough for a USB port. Instead, Apple will start using the new type-c reversible connectors. There also won’t be an SD card slot or a MagSafe power connector–even Apple’s beloved Thunderbolt is taking a hike. USB will do it all.
MBA
The 12-inch laptop would be substantially smaller and lighter than the 13-inch model, and even slightly smaller than the 11-inch version. This is thanks to slimmer bezels and a slightly more compact keyboard with less separate between keys. 9to5Mac doesn’t have details on exactly how high the resolution will be, but the current Airs are sitting at 1366 x 768 (11-inch) and 1440 x 900 (13-inch). Stepping it up to a Retina Display resolution of 2560 x 1600 (like the 13-inch Pro) would be amazing in the Air’s form factor.

To be clear, all the images of this supposed notebook are renders created by 9to5Mac. This is still thoroughly in the rumor category, but it’s a redesign we’ve been expecting for a long time. The updated MacBook Air could be announced in mid-2015.

1122,Cold Turkey,"James Foley went missing in November 2012

A video posted online Tuesday purportedly shows an Islamist extremist beheading James Foley, an American journalist kidnapped in Syria more than 18 months ago.

A graphic video of the purported killing, whose authenticity could not be immediately verified, was posted online Tuesday and quickly spread on social media. The video, which appears to be the work of the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria, declares the act “A Message to #America (from the #IslamicState)” and retribution for the United States’ intervention against ISIS in Iraq. Some versions of the video and Twitter accounts circulating it were quickly taken offline Tuesday evening, though the video soon appeared on YouTube again.

TIME is not publishing the video. The video also includes a threat to kill Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who has written for TIME among other outlets, and has been missing since August 2013.

A Facebook page affiliated with the Foley family’s campaign for his release posted a message Tuesday saying it couldn’t confirm the authenticity of the video or Foley’s fate.

“We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers,” the post read. “Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

A spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council said the American intelligence community “is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity.”

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said. “We will provide more information when it is available.”

Foley “was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria,” near the Turkish border, the FBI said in an alert following the Nov. 22, 2012, kidnapping. He was in Binesh covering the Syrian civil war for the GlobalPost website and AFP.

1123,Homeland Security says terrorists haven't crossed U.S-Mexico border,"A Texas National Guard soldier scans the Mexican side of the U.S.–Mexico border in Havana, Texas.  John Moore / Getty Images

Two Republican lawmakers told BuzzFeed News Wednesday suspected terrorists have infiltrated the U.S.–Mexico border and as many as 10 fighters have been captured, but Homeland Security officials deny any such thing has happened.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, said four alleged terror suspects were captured on Sept. 10 in Texas. In an interview Wednesday, Chaffetz said the men flew from a Middle Eastern country to Mexico City, where they paid a smuggler to take them to and across the border. From there, the men ended up in a safe house for immigrants. They were en route to New York City, Chaffetz said, when they were captured.

Chaffetz would not reveal his source of the information, but said he confirmed it with government officials. “I had an informant tell me about it and then I questioned the Secretary of Homeland Security,” he said. “I have no doubt about its authenticity.”

The four alleged terror suspects had affiliations with groups other than the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Chaffetz said. He added that they were still being held in Texas as of Wednesday.

California Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican who represents San Diego County, made headlines Tuesday when he said to Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren that he had “asked Border Patrol” about terrorists and learned that several had been captured.

Hunter claimed 10 terror suspects had been caught near the border, including four people allegedly captured in September.

“I know at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” he said on the program.

Hunter’s spokesman Joe Kasper told BuzzFeed News the congressman’s assertion that 10 terror suspects had been captured along the border included the same four people described by Chaffetz. Kasper claimed four other suspects had been captured within the last 36 hours, and pointed to a Judicial Watch story that allegedly “confirmed” the most recent captures to back up his assertion.

Two additional suspects were picked up sometime after the first group in September, but before this week, Kasper said.

The Department of Homeland Security strongly denied Hunter’s claim that terror suspects had been caught near the border.

When reached for comment, Customs and Border Protection referred BuzzFeed News to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which did not respond to emails Wednesday. However, DHS released an identical statement to both The New Republic and ABC News denying that there were terrorists coming across the border:

The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.

But Hunter isn’t buying that explanation. His spokesman told BuzzFeed News Wednesday that they have evidence from reliable sources about “foreign nationals” being captured along the border. Kasper said those foreign nationals may not technically be ISIS fighters, but do have suspected terror group affiliations. Kasper did not identify his sources but said that Hunter’s office remains convinced that the lawmaker was correct.

The issue of terrorists coming over the U.S.–Mexico border has been a contentious and increasingly politicized one.

Among the other claims about terrorists using the border to enter the country, Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said ISIS may be teaming up with Mexican drug cartels. Audio recorded at a town hall apparently showed Cotton saying that ISIS could potentially attack people in Arkansas, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.

Cotton did not respond to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment Wednesday, but when the Post asked about the statements his spokesman pointed to a series of conservative websites. And like many of the claims about the border and terrorism, the story goes back months and relies on sources who are not named — making it difficult to verify.",discuss
1124,Christian Bale In Talks To Play Steve Jobs In Sony's Next Biopic,"The Islamic State released a video of its jihadists beheading American journalist James Wright Foley in Syria. The video is almost five minutes long and includes threats against President Barack Obama and the United States.
In the video, which was temporarily available on YouTube but has since been removed, the terrorists remind the audience Obama authorized military action against IS and replayed Obama’s press conference when he announced the airstrikes. To them the declaration is a “slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims.”
Foley then appears on his knees in an orange jumpsuit. He relays a message that the US government is his true killer. He addresses his family as well. The message is choppy, which gives the appearance that he is reading off cards placed in front of the camera.
His executioner speaks with what appears to be a British accent, saying many Muslims worldwide accepted IS and a war against IS is, in essence, a war against Muslims. The UK has been one of the Islamic State's most active targets of recruitment.
After he beheads Foley, he presents to the camera another journalist, Steven Joel Soltoff, who worked for Time and The National Interest. Soltoff was reported missing in the middle of last year. The executioner said America’s next move will determine IS’s next move in what appears to be a threat against the second journalist.
Foley was an independent journalist in the Middle East. In 2011, he was one of four journalists kidnapped by Qaddafi’s forces in Libya, of which he said in an interview with the Boston Globe, “You don’t want to be defined as that guy who got captured in 2011... believe that front-line journalism is important.” He spoke at Northwestern University about his experience in Libya.

1126,Purported ISIS claim: Jordan airstrike kills female US hostage,"A humorous report on a satirical Web site done in the style of China's state broadcaster CCTV offers advice to Chinese on how to choose their English names. ""English names come with different connotations. It’s not always fair to those people, but they do,"" the article warns. ""A name can come with a ‘feeling’ or idea about what sort of person you are, and where you come from.""

The adoption of unconventional English names in China and other parts of East Asia is the source of perennial fascination and mirth among expats. Any young Anglophone who teaches English in the region could rattle off a host of perplexing names he or she had to call out during class.

One friend of WorldViews who taught English and civics in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou had a number of students whose chosen English names were derived from screen names used during online computer games. There was Orcapm, who was not to be outdone by Skycoolz.

""Sure, have fun and pick a random object or word as a name, but avoid them if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America,"" the post chides. It offers this guide:

A good way to work out the ‘feeling’ of a name is to watch a bunch of American movies and sitcoms. They’re full of name stereotypes — you’ll find the good girls’ are all ‘Jane’s, the jock boys’ are still ‘Buds’ and the geeks’ are called ‘Sheldon’.

The report also lays out a set of rules governing the types of English names typically adopted by Chinese. Be careful about what may sound inappropriate alongside common Chinese family names such as Wang or Dong. In general, it's good to avoid food as a name, it suggests.

To put bluntly, names like Candy, Lolly, Sugar (think anything sweet), are typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.

It’s not always right; there are doubtless some very smart Candy’s out there. But it’s the first thing that comes to mind.

Other instructions include eschewing the names of famous leaders or celebrities. ""Pick any name like Obama, Einstein or Madonna and you’re going to get some stares,"" it says. ""You have some pretty big shoes to fill there.""

At a McDonald's restaurant in Hong Kong, WorldViews once was served by an employee whose badge confusingly read ""Franco Mussolini."" One hopes he didn't harbor similar dreams of power and domination.

While it's easy to make fun of such unusual naming conventions, it's also hard not to appreciate the playfulness with which these names get chosen. Often, Chinese people pick an English name as a play of words based on their original given Chinese name. The Atlantic offers a few examples from the Cantonese-speaking city of Hong Kong:

Many English names mimic the sound of Chinese given names. A solicitor called Tse Kar-son, for example, has Carson as his English name. Singer Lee Hak-kan's English name is Hacken. Another singer, Chan Yik-shun, is called Eason...

Ho Wai-leuk, a journalist, got his name another way. ""When I was a student, everyone kept saying my Chinese name really fast until it started sounding like 'hoh lok,'"" he said referring to the Cantonese pronunciation for Coca-Cola, ""so Cola stuck.""

For most people, our names are our names and we have little choice in the matter. But the practice of adopting a new English name can be seen as an exercise in self-expression, especially in societies where larger trends of conformity hold some sway.

Who wouldn't want to be able to re-brand themselves or be able to highlight some unique part of their identity? Just don't use that power to call yourself ""Bunny Wang,"" the post says.

Correction: An earlier version of this story reported that the original post was from CCTV. It was, in fact, by a satirical news site.",unrelated
1127,AWESOME! Canadian Parliament’s Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers Takes Out Gunman,"The hoax story has been circulating far and wide on Twitter and Facebook

It may feel like winter is slowly squeezing all the sunlight out of your day, but if you see any news stories claiming the Earth is headed for ‘Six Days of Total Darkness’ then don’t start stocking up on the tins of beans and torches just yet.

‘Satirical news site’ Huzlers.com has been spreading this fake story far and wide on the web this week, taking in numerous Facebook and Twitter users and encouraging them to post about what they’re going to be up to during the six days of darkness.

The story on the vaguely official looking website titled “Nasa Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2014!” claims that an incoming solar storm is to blame, causing ""dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus block 90% sunlight”.

This is false. Although solar storms certainly are real phenomena (they occur due to fluctuations in the Sun’s magnetic field) they’re not like terrestrial storms that can blow up dust and dirt.

Instead they create very minor disturbances in the Earth’s magnetosphere. Historically there have been rare storms that could knock out electrical systems today, but they're mostly of the order of magnitude only likely to throw a homing pigeon slightly off course – not blot out the Sun.

However, the hoax story even drafts in some credible-sounding sources including Nasa chief Charles Bolden, who reportedly warned the public to stay calm. Some users even linked to a (real) video of Bolden talking about “emergency preparedness” – an official-sounding phrase that apparently bypasses common sense to hit the big button marked ‘PANIC’ in the brain.

In actuality Bolden recorded the video to encourage US families to think about what they would do in the event of an earthquake or hurricane – natural disasters that are a real enough threat in America.

This total-darkness hoax apparently comes in a couple of flavours (some claim that a non-existent “photon belt” is responsible for the blackout) and are so widespread that Nasa employees even had to debunk the rumours themselves back in 2012.",unrelated

1131,ISIS Releases YouTube Video Showing 10-Year-Old 'Martyr' Allegedly Killed in Battle,"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was attacked in prison and left blinded and paralyzed, a satirical website claimed in a story that quickly went viral this weekend.

On Saturday, the site Empire News posted a story claiming that the Boston Marathon bombing suspect was found lying in a pool of blood in his cell in Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts. The story made the rounds on the internet, with thousands of shares on Facebook and other social media and many welcoming the news.

But there is one problem — the incident never happened, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is still safe in his cell awaiting trial. Though the story fooled many, others noted that Empire News is a site dedicated entirely to satire, like a lesser known version of The Onion.

Those who browsed the site a bit found that out. Empire News has posted other stories including “Former Vice President Al Gore Arrested For Indecent Exposure,” and “It’s Official: New York Jets Moving To Los Angeles, Construction Of Los Angeles Stadium Begins.”

The details of the story itself gave readers reason for doubt.

“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. “We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”

The story went on to say that Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was actually attacked in prison by members of the Aryan Nation prison gang.

“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. “The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”

1132,"Boko Haram Cease-Fire: Abducted Nigerian Schoolgirls To Be Released, Officials Say","“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2015 that is scheduled to be released during winter. The latest reports, however, claim that J.J. Abrams, the director of the seventh episode of the epic space opera, wants an early release date for his movie.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is currently scheduled to be released on Dec. 18, 2015. Based on YouTuber Votesaxon 07’s video, Movie Pilot reports that J.J. Abrams wants to release “Episode 7” in the summer of 2015. The report by the aforementioned entertainment news publication claims that the 48-year-old director made the announcement at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015.

The publication claims that the reason why J.J. Abrams wants to release “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” almost six months before its scheduled date is the alleged plot and images leaks from the sets and script. The moviemaker is now worried that these plot leaks will make the film “predictable and not worth watching” for the audience.

According to the website, moving the release date forward would be “an extremely brave move,” putting it up against other fan-favourite releases such as “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Jurassic World” and “Ant-Man.” However, shifting the release date means a lot of work for the moviemakers and the studio. Meanwhile, Ikwiz reports that Disney is “seriously” considering J.J. Abrams' demand of summer release of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

Fans must note that these reports lack official comments from the associated parties; thus, the information must be taken with a pinch of salt. However, fans know that Disney is seriously dealing with the issue of image leak. Recently, the studio issued a subpoena over the leak of images from “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

In additional news, J.J. Abrams finally broke his silence on the controversy over the new lightsaber that debuted in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” trailer. Speaking to Collider at a Hollywood event, the director admitted receiving tons of emails arguing about the new lightsaber and its functionality.

""It's been the funniest thing to see the arguments that have developed over this thing,” J.J Abrams said. ""This was not done without a lot of conversation. It's fun to see people have the conversation that we had, but in reverse,” the director explained.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” features John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, Harrison For as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as Leia, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, and Domhnall Gleeson, Max von Sydow and Adam Driver, all in unspecified roles. Stay tuned for more updates.

In it, Foley is forced to read a letter urging Americans to rise up against his “real killer,” the “U.S. government.” I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killer, the U.S. government. What will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality.”

According to Time’s Mirren Gidda:

American airstrikes began earlier this month in an attempt to help thousands of people—members of the Yazidi, an ethnic minority in the region—who were trapped on a mountain range by fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS). President Barack Obama formally told Congress on Sunday that he had sanctioned additional air raids, though he said they would be limited. The new strikes, requested by the Iraqi government, were intended to help Iraqi and Kurdish security forces who had been battling the militants for control of the strategic Mosul Dam. Aided by U.S. air support, these troops successfully recaptured it on Aug. 18.

The video also shows a man on his knees who is allegedly Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who went missing in Syria on Aug. 3, 2013. According to the video, Sotloff’s fate depends on Obama’s “next decision.”

Mr Abdulla, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, told The Sun: ‘She was determined to find her son and went to Isis headquarters and asked to see him.

‘The Isis men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.’

She was then given meat, rice and soup.

He continued: ‘But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said “You’ve just eaten him”.’

Mr Abdulla decided to go to Iraq after discovering that Isis had come within six miles of his home village in Kurdistan.

He said that Isis was threatening to kidnap and bury people alive unless they surrendered.

He has now returned to Yorkshire, but hopes to return to fight the terror group.",unrelated
1135,Predator Drone Reportedly Spotted Over ISIS Hotbed in Syria; Airstrikes Hit ISIS Targets,"New York City continues to seek ways to cut down on the large number of low-level arrests stemming from marijuana possession.

The NYPD plans to stop arrests for small amounts of marijuana, instead opting to issue court summonses, according to a report Nov. 9 in the New York Times. It wasn't immediately clear what threshold the city will use to determine low-level procession or when the new policy will be implemented.

Brooklyn has stopped prosecuting most low-level marijuana cases, the borough's district attorney said July 8. The policy change in New York's most populous borough makes exceptions for those with a criminal history or who smoke marijuana in public places or near children.

Blacks and Hispanics comprised 86% of all marijuana arrests in New York by August, according to the Marijuana Arrest Research Project. The Brooklyn district attorney's office has dismissed 849 marijuana cases since July, or about 34% of the 2,526 total cases in Brooklyn.

A 2013 New York Civil Liberties Union report called New York City ""the nation's marijuana arrest capital."" It said that that in 2010, King's County (Brooklyn) had 20,413 marijuana-related arrests and summonses, more than any other county in the state. The majority of arrests were of black people.

""Given that these cases are ultimately — and predictably — dismissed, the burdens that they pose on the system and the individual are difficult to justify. We are pouring money into an endeavor that produces no public safety benefit.""
Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson
Thompson said the policy change was meant to avoid giving criminal records to nonviolent individuals, particularly young people of color.

""Our police officers must enforce the laws of the State of New York uniformly throughout all five boroughs of the City. Accordingly, the Kings County policy change will not result in any changes in the policies and procedures of the NYPD.""
Bill Bratton, New York City police commissioner
Bratton said in a statement on July 8 that police officers will continue to enforce the law, despite the district attorney's decision to stop prosecuting low-level crimes. A spokesman for the Staten Island district attorney said his borough would also ""enforce the law.""

Controversial policy ended:

1137,Nigeria: hopes for return of kidnapped schoolgirls rise after ceasefire reported,"“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2015 that is scheduled to be released during winter. The latest reports, however, claim that J.J. Abrams, the director of the seventh episode of the epic space opera, wants an early release date for his movie.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is currently scheduled to be released on Dec. 18, 2015. Based on YouTuber Votesaxon 07’s video, Movie Pilot reports that J.J. Abrams wants to release “Episode 7” in the summer of 2015. The report by the aforementioned entertainment news publication claims that the 48-year-old director made the announcement at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015.

The publication claims that the reason why J.J. Abrams wants to release “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” almost six months before its scheduled date is the alleged plot and images leaks from the sets and script. The moviemaker is now worried that these plot leaks will make the film “predictable and not worth watching” for the audience.

According to the website, moving the release date forward would be “an extremely brave move,” putting it up against other fan-favourite releases such as “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Jurassic World” and “Ant-Man.” However, shifting the release date means a lot of work for the moviemakers and the studio. Meanwhile, Ikwiz reports that Disney is “seriously” considering J.J. Abrams' demand of summer release of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

Fans must note that these reports lack official comments from the associated parties; thus, the information must be taken with a pinch of salt. However, fans know that Disney is seriously dealing with the issue of image leak. Recently, the studio issued a subpoena over the leak of images from “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

In additional news, J.J. Abrams finally broke his silence on the controversy over the new lightsaber that debuted in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” trailer. Speaking to Collider at a Hollywood event, the director admitted receiving tons of emails arguing about the new lightsaber and its functionality.

""It's been the funniest thing to see the arguments that have developed over this thing,” J.J Abrams said. ""This was not done without a lot of conversation. It's fun to see people have the conversation that we had, but in reverse,” the director explained.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” features John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, Harrison For as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as Leia, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, and Domhnall Gleeson, Max von Sydow and Adam Driver, all in unspecified roles. Stay tuned for more updates.

1138,"Jose Canseco injured in accidental shooting, per reports","Amazon may be venturing beyond the world of online retail to set up its first brick-and-mortar shop, according to a report from Bloomberg News.

The store will be in Seattle and its focus will be pricier merchandise such as tablet computers, the report says. And its footprint won’t be nearly as large as that of big box retailers such as Barnes & Noble.

The single store is a test run for Amazon to see whether a chain of retail outlets could be profitable. If so, it could be a way for the company to make up for the declines they’ve seen in profits due to the manufacturing costs of the Kindle Fire.

The blog Good E Reader reports that Amazon has hired a designer to begin work on the store’s look and layout and that it is aiming to open its doors later this year in time for the holiday shopping season.

There would be certain advantages to Amazon having retail stores — namely that some items could be picked up immediately instead of going through shipping once they were purchased online.

Over at Forbes, Eric Savitz notes that this isn’t the first time that there have been rumors about Amazon opening a chain of stores — in 2009 similar rumors surfaced after the Sunday Times reported the online retailer was looking at properties. Amazon quickly refuted the report.

1139,"U.S. accidentally delivered weapons to the Islamic State by airdrop, militants say","Piper Jaffray’s Gene Munster has issued a new report to investors, breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices. The analyst predicts that the stainless steel Apple Watch will be priced at $499, while the 18k Gold Edition will sell for $4,999, AppleInsider reports. He also said that on average, consumers will spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Apple watch versions

Apple Watch will be released in three separate price tiers i.e. Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, with each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices. Starting with Apple Watch Sport, Munster expects an ASP (average selling price) of $450 including configuration choices like case and internal storage options. The stainless steel Apple Watch model is expected to start at $499 to $549, with an overall ASP at around $650. Regarding the Apple Watch Edition, the analyst forecasts the base model to start at $4,999, while classifying segment ASP at $7,500.

Based on current pricing for Apple’s silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars. 

“If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,” Munster writes. 

Lastly, Munster expects the Sport model to make up 55% of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take 45%. As for Apple Watch Edition, Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year.

Based on what we know so far about the Apple Watch, which model do you plan on getting?",unrelated

He says that since the accident he has been able to attract metal objects like coins and spoons towards his body, just like the famous Marvel villain.

Nikolai said: 'When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened. When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.'

He said he was a keen fan of comics and, believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto, had decided to put it to the test.

He said: 'I can do things I couldn't do before but I don't have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things.’

Nikolai says he has now decided to become a superhero rather than a fireman when he is older, as he wants to do something that helps people (clearly fireman wasn’t helping people enough).

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers.

Stories about 'living magnets' began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century. In 2004, the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Although people who have the ability to attract metal items are commonly referred to as 'magnets,' many of them can also hold plastic, glass, wood and paper items on their body.

Only some of them develop a 'preference' for a particular material. In 1990, as many as 300 'living magnets' gathered for a conference in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV. The woman could hold 7 kilos of metal on a vertical palm.

1143,Kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls: Government claims ceasefire deal with Boko Haram that will bring missing girls home,"A Catholic priest from Massachusetts had been dead for 48 minutes before he was miraculously resuscitated. However, it is his description about God that is bound to spark a hot debate about the almighty.

Father John Michael O’Neal was officially declared dead for more than 48 minutes, but medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. According to the 71-year-old man of God, the supreme entity isn’t a man, as is popularly assumed and believed. Father O’Neal claims he met God during the brief time he was officially dead and God is a woman.

The catholic father claims God is a warm and comforting motherly figure. The revelation will undoubtedly have a profound bearing on the teachings of Christianity, which firmly believes and even implies that God is a male figure who has watched over us with love and devotion. Though the love and devotion part is corroborated by Father O’Neal, he differs from the church’s teachings about the gender of God.

Father John Micheal O’neal had the chance to meet with the divine when he was rushed to a hospital late last month owing to a massive heart attack. However, Father O’Neal was declared clinically dead shortly after his arrival. Not one to give up hope so easily, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital kept the blood flowing to his brain with the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2.

While the blood flowed with the help of modern science, doctors worked tirelessly to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm. Consistent with near-death experiences, Father O’Neal entered heaven through a gate made of bright light and encountered God. However, instead of the all-mighty father figure, the priest claims he was warmly greeted by a motherly figure. Father O’Neal describes the divine entity as “mother-like ‘Being of Light.'”

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting. She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

As expected, the priest’s claims about the gender of God has created quite a stir amidst devote Catholics. The intense discussion between the catholic clergy of the archdiocese about the “experience” of the father and the ramifications of his revelations persuaded the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.

Though his superiors have disapproved, Father O’Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother.”

“I wish to continue preaching. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

Given the potency of Father O’Neal’s alleged experience, it is quite likely he might face some resistance and criticism. However, he is prepared, assures the priest.

1147,Weaponized Ebola? ISIS Militants Said To Contract Deadly Virus,"It's what national security organizations have feared since day one-the World Health Organization (WHO) announced last week that they are evaluating jihadist militants associated with ISIS, who may have contracted the virus responsible for Ebola. While the WHO has yet to confirm whether or not the fighters are exhibiting symptoms, the current evaluations of a Mosul hospital 250 miles north of Baghdad are prompting concerns that the fringe extremist group ISIS may in fact be able to obtain a biological weapon unlike anything the world has seen before.

Like Us on Facebook 

Though Mosul has been under ISIS control since late last June, the Iraqi health ministry has issued a press release denying reports from Iraqi news outlets that claim the soldier are definitively infected and seeking treatment in Mosul.

""The Ebola virus could be in any area in the world, including Mosul, where they don't have the measures or techniques to diagnose the virus"" spokesperson for the health ministry Ahmed Rudaini says. ""They are incapable to detect it.""

Over the past several months, the world has watched as threats from extremist group ISIS have come true, from the beheadings of captured prisoners of war to the mass murder of children's schools. And with the possibility of a global pandemic looming over our heads, many are demanding action be taken to isolate the potential vectors as a worst case scenario. Yet, as conflicting reports abound, international health organizations and the WHO are unable to assess the health concern on site, and treat the patients as their own.

WHO director Christy Feig told reporters early this weekend that "" We [the WHO] have no official notification from the Iraqi government that it is Ebola.""

While that may be true, the possibility that the militants may have contracted the virus causes a problematic situation for the WHO, in that ISIS does not believe in modern medicine and an outbreak in an ISIS-controlled area like Mosul could be a breeding ground for the ever-mutating virus. But worst of all, aside from the possibility of possible infection of Iraq, should ISIS isolate the virus for themselves, the entire western world may find soon enough that the Ebola virus could be the worst weapon known to man.

""U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,"" intelligence analyst for Levantine Group, Benjamin T. Decker says. ""In this context, the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.""",discuss
1148,Saudi cleric issues fatwa on snowmen,"Mounted with a cannon and leaving a trail of shells in its wake, a black pickup truck in the hands of jihadists in Syria has brought woe to a family of Texas City plumbers by way of the insignia on its driver-side door: “Mark-1 Plumbing”.

On Monday a Chechen-led group linked to the extremist group Ansar al-Deen, a sometime ally of Islamic State (Isis) and al-Nusra fighters, tweeted a photo of the black Ford F-250 in action near Aleppo. Since then, Mark Olberholtzer and his family near Houston have received hundreds of phone calls with questions and threats.

Attempts to call the Olberholtzer family, who own Mark-1 Plumbing, reached only a recorded message or a disconnected line. On Tuesday Mark Olberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News he was mystified: “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.” His son Jeff similarly expressed bafflement to KHOU local news: “We had no intentions or idea that this would happen.”

“To think something we would use to pull trailers, now is being used for terror – it’s crazy. Never in my life would I think something like that,” the younger Olberholtzer told KHOU.

The Olberholtzers sold the truck in October 2013 to a nearby Houston dealership run by AutoNation, confirmed Marc Cannon, senior vice-president of AutoNation’s corporate communications. Cannon told the Guardian that AutoNation sent the truck to the Adesa auction house in Houston.

The car was sold on the auction block to a local used car dealer, though Adesa has not yet responded to requests to identify the dealer. An operator at the auction house told the Guardian the company has been bombarded by calls, and that she was surprised that neither the plumbers nor the jihadis had simply removed the logo.

From the port of Houston the Olberholtzers’ old F-250 likely made it to a dealership in eastern Europe, Africa or the Middle East, and within a few months changed hands several times before it finally reached a jihadist sympathizer. The truck then likely passed through Turkey’s porous border, which lies only a few hours’ drive from Aleppo and the chaotic battles so far removed from south-eastern Texas.

About erasing the logo, the elder Olberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News that AutoNation or one of the other middlemen “were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it”. The plumber of 32 years said his family has received death threats and that some of the callers “are really ugly”.

“We have a secretary here, she’s scared to death. We all have families,” his son told KHOU. “We have nothing to do with terror at all.”

His father had a message to the broader world: “I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth.”

A representative of Mark-1 Plumbing told CBS News that they plan to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo. The person said that sold vehicles would “most definitely” have the logo removed henceforth.

Auction houses, which make more profit the faster they turn products, usually sell used cars quickly, and exporters are often keen to pick up unwanted vehicles from lots. Those exporters then ship used cars into the sizeable market in developing nations, where a battered Ford can find a long second life, or where scavengers can resurrect a lemon or dismantle it for parts.",unrelated
1149,Kim Jong-un necks litres of rare SNAKE wine because he's too fat to please his wife,"FEARS have been raised that Islamic militants have seized a dozen commercial aircraft in an attack on a Libyan airport last week. Now, according to a report, intelligence agencies are warning the jets could be used in 9/11-style attacks.

“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” one official told The Washington Free Beacon this morning.

“We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

The report said intelligence reports distributed within the US government over the past few weeks have detailed the types of aircraft believed seized. Several have the size and range to reach deep into Europe and Africa.

The Beacon reports the analysts as issuing a specific warning — that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack on the date marking the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in the United States.

It is also the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi.

The threat warning comes as dramatic video reveals the final moments of a Libyan combat jet.

The aircraft plunged into the ground less than a kilometre from the country’s parliament during a fly-past intended to honour the pilot of another fighter jet that died in a crash a week ago.

The resulting fireball damaged several nearby buildings.

Libya is witnessing its worst violence since former dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi was toppled and killed in 2011.

The country’s divisions are deeply rooted in rivalries between Islamists and non-Islamists, as well as powerful tribal and regional allegiances between groups that quickly filled the power vacuum after Gaddafi’s was ousted. Successive transitional governments have failed to control the militias.

FIGHTING FLARES UP

Fierce clashes have erupted in recent days over Libya’s eastern city of Benghazi.

Fighting between Islamist militiamen and rival forces loyal to a renegade general killed 31 fighters on both sides, a security official said overnight.

The fighting erupted late on Monday, with forces and fighter jets belonging to General Khalifa Hifter pounding positions of Islamist militias called The Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council, said the official.

The issue of foreign military intervention is one of the most debated in the country. Earlier this month, unknown parties carried out air strikes in Tripoli, bombing Islamist-allied militias’ positions. American officials confirmed reports that Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were behind the two air strikes.

The hours-long clashes concentrated around the city’s Benina airport and the militiamen responded with artillery, added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media.

Hifter’s side lost 20 fighters while the militiamen had 11 killed, and 36 fighters in all were wounded, the official said. Several of the wounded were reported to be in critical condition.

Fighting in recent months has mostly engulfed the capital, Tripoli, and also Benghazi, the country’s second-largest city.

The militias in control of the capital, operating under an umbrella group called the Dawn of Libya, have also taken control of the US embassy compound a week after they drove out rival militias.

On Tuesday, Libya’s official news agency said calm had returned to Tripoli, with some banks resuming work and shops and bakeries reopening. Traffic also picked up in the capital and there were long lines outside gas stations. Some families who fled the fighting areas have returned to their homes, the agency said.

POLITICAL CRISIS

On Monday, Libya’s newly elected parliament asked Abdullah al-Thinni — the country’s prime minister who resigned last week — to form a new government. Al-Thinni had said after his resignation that his government had lost control of almost all state institutions and government offices to the armed Islamist militias.

The fighting forced the newly elected parliament and al-Thinni to operate in the eastern city of Tobruk.

On Tuesday, Mohammed Shouaib, the deputy head of parliament, stressed that the body did not ask for “military intervention” but for the United Nations to help Libya build its institutions, including the police and military. He was referring to an earlier decision by the parliament to call for international help in restoring order in Libya.

Shouaib was speaking in a press conference with British envoy Jonathan Powell and British ambassador Michael Aron, who were visiting Tobruk to express support to the elected parliament.

Meanwhile in Tripoli, a parallel government is in the making. Supported by Islamist allies, the so-called National Salvation government led by Omar al-Hassi and his 14-ministers won a vote of confidence. Al-Hassi was appointed by the outgoing parliament — whose mandate expired after a new parliament was elected — and assigned him to form a new government to challenge the legitimate ones in Tobruk.",unrelated

While the reports, from Kurdish and pro-Iraqi sources, remain unconfirmed, WHO spokesman Christy Feig said the group are trying to reach out to officials in ISIS-held areas to offer help.

Infection: Several ISIS militants have arrived at a hospital in Mosul displaying signs of Ebola according to unconfirmed reports

UN workers are currently banned from entering ISIS-controlled areas in both Iraq and Syria so it is unlikely an operation in the region could be carried out.

Ms Feig told Mashable: 'We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.'

The symptoms of ebola are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever

Mosul has been under control of ISIS since June 2014 and over the past few weeks militants have reportedly executed more than a dozen doctors for refusing to treat injured fighters.

According to a report in Iraq's pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, the disease was brought to Mosul by 'terrorists' arriving 'from several countries' and Africa.

The symptoms of Ebola, which include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising, are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever meaning it could easily have have been misdiagnosed.

In addition, very few ISIS fighters are believed to have travelled up from West Africa where the Ebola outbreak originated with most coming from areas where there have been no reports of the disease.

The reports have appeared in pro-government and Kurdish media but if true it could have catastrophic implications for people in ISIS-held areas as the group is against western science and medicine.

It is not known if any of the surviving doctors in Mosul are equipped to test for Ebola or trained to treat patients and prevent the spread of the disease.

1153,ISIL Beheads American Photojournalist in Iraq,"New York (CNN) -- When war reporter James Foley wasn't writing for GlobalPost or recording video for AFP or appearing on the PBS ""NewsHour,"" he occasionally shared stories on his own blog, aptly titled ""A World of Troubles.""

For a subtitle, he chose the famous Carl von Clausewitz sentence ""War is fought by human beings.""

And that is exactly what Foley sought to show with his reporting: humanity amid the horror of war.

Foley was abducted while on a reporting trip in northern Syria in November 2012. He was never heard from again.

A video published Tuesday by the extremist group ISIS showed Foley being beheaded. It is not known when or where the video was recorded.

For Foley's family and friends, the recording was the answer they hoped they'd never hear to their questions about his disappearance.

""We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,"" his mother, Diane, said Tuesday night,

She called him ""an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person.""

Courageous, generous

Foley was the oldest child of Diane and John Foley of Rochester, New Hampshire. He had four siblings.

Foley -- Jim to his friends -- had been reporting from war-torn countries for the better part of four years when he disappeared in Syria.

On Tuesday, fellow journalists remembered him for his courage and his generosity.

One of his friends, Alex Sherman of Bloomberg News, wrote on Twitter that he was a ""funny, warm, Big Lebowski-loving guy.""

Another friend, Max Fisher of Vox, praised his ""dedication to truth and understanding.""

Fisher also wrote that ""Jim's faith was something we all agreed not to discuss publicly while he was held in Syria, but it was the wellspring of his generosity,""

He recalled how Foley helped to organize a memorial fund for a photographer, Anton Hammerl, who was killed in Libya in 2011.

Foley had been traveling with Hammerl and two other journalists at the time, and the three who survived wound up in a Libyan jail.

Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors

Front-line journalist

Foley was freed six weeks later. Afterward, in a video interview with the Boston Globe, he hesitated to make the story about himself, remarking at one point that ""you don't want to be defined as 'that guy who got captured in 2011.'""

""I believe that front-line journalism is important, you know -- without these photos and videos and first-hand experience, we can't really tell the world how bad it might be,"" he said.

One of the journalists detained with Foley in Libya, Clare Morgana Gillis, said his fundraising for Hammerl's family was ""the same impulse that compelled him to cut short his much-needed break from reporting in Syria when a colleague went missing last summer, and to raise money for an ambulance for Aleppo's Dar al-Shifa field hospital, where he spent weeks filming the plight of doctors who struggled to save lives with minimal space equipment.""

His time as a teacher

For Foley, these were acts of service, not entirely unlike his time spent in the Teach for America program. He began teaching in Phoenix in 1996.

""He'd promise students that he'd take them to the Castles and Coasters amusement park if they would come to class everyday,"" a fellow Teach for America alum, Sarah Fang, recalled in an essay in 2013.

Foley later ""taught reading and writing to inmates at the Cook County Sheriff's Boot Camp in Chicago,"" according to a Columbia Journalism Review feature about him.

Would you watch the video?

His journalism career

In the mid-2000s he decided to pursue a journalism career, first by enrolling at Northwestern University's well-respected Medill School of Journalism and then by embedding with American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. While preparing for his first embed, he started his blog.

Foley freelanced for a number of news media outlets, including GlobalPost, a world news Web site founded in 2009.

In 2012, he gravitated toward the spiraling conflict in Syria.

Fang, who kept in touch with Foley after their years teaching in Phoenix, wrote that his interest in the story there did not surprise her.

""He's always been willing to step into a zone where no one else wants to go,"" she wrote. ""Jim feels that society needs reporters willing to bear witness and report back the facts of history-in-the-making. And his loyalty to his colleagues meant that he wanted to be there with them on the frontlines.""

BuzzFeed Middle East correspondent Sheera Frenkel said she last saw Foley about a week before his final trip into Syria.

Drinking beers at the lobby of a hotel popular among journalists, they talked, she said, about ""how hard it was to move on from this job, into a life which would allow for marriage and family.""

""He was a generous colleague, never holding back a tip, phone number, or detail that could help, and could spend hours talking over the ins and outs of a story to get it just right,"" Frenkel wrote in an email message.

""Jim was a great journalist, and I think he'd like to be remembered that way, first and foremost.""

After the news of Foley's killing spread on Tuesday, CBS News foreign correspondent Clarissa Ward changed her profile picture on Twitter to a photo of Foley wearing a helmet, a flak jacket and holding up a camera.

This, she said, ""is how I will chose to remember James -- as a brave and tireless journalist with a passion for the Syrian cause.""

1154,FBI Probing Alleged Audio of Michael Brown Shooting,"Claim: Deandre Joshua was murdered after testifying before a grand jury in Ferguson.

FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, December 2014]

Deandre Joshua, 20 was murdered after testifying to a grand jury in the ferguson, MO case. Supposedly he was found not far from where Brown's body was & he was covered in lighter fluid. It was a post I saw on FB & just wondered if it was true.

Origins: Shortly after a 20-year-old man named Deandre Joshua was killed in Ferguson, Missouri, on 24 November 2014, rumors started circulating around the Internet connecting the young man's murder to the non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson in the controversial shooting death of Michael Brown.

The details of Joshua's death are gruesome. According to the Washington Post, Deandre was shot once in the head and then burned inside his car. The incident occurred on the same night protesters took to the streets of Ferguson to protest the grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson. These circumstances, coupled with the fact that Joshua was a friend of Dorian Johnson, who was with Mike Brown on the night of his death, led many to believe Joshua's murder was in some way connected to Wilson's non-indictment:

This is Deandre Joshua. This 20 year old man testified in the Grand Jury case against Darren Wilson. He was shot and killed on Tuesday. His body was found, with lighter fluid all over it, not far from where Darren Wilson killed Michael Brown. Why are broken windows on the front page of our news, and not his face?

However, there is no documentation Deandre Joshua testified before the grand jury. According to the Boston Globe , names of the witnesses were kept secret, and anyone who disclosed that information would face a misdemeanor charge. Additionally, Joshua's family and friends told the New York Times he was nowhere near the scene when Mike Brown was shot and killed, and prosecutors confirmed he was not a grand jury witness:

According to family members, friends and law-enforcement officials, however, Joshua was nowhere near Canfield Drive when Brown was killed during a confrontation with Wilson on Aug. 9 and couldn't have witnessed the shooting. And McCulloch's office, which remained tight-lipped about the Wilson investigation, confirmed that Joshua didn't offer testimony during the proceedings.

""He was not a witness,"" said Ed Magee, a spokesman for the county prosecutor.

Deandre Joshua did not witness the shooting of Michael Brown, nor did he testify before the grand jury. The only connection that Joshua had to the case was that he was a childhood friend of Dorian Johnson (who did witness the shooting):

As of 2 December 2014, Deandre Joshua's death is still under investigation by police. It is unclear who killed Joshua or why they did so, but it is clear is Joshua's death was not retaliation for grand jury testimony in the Brown case.""

1155,Missing Libyan aircraft spark fears of 9/11-style attack in North Africa,"Jihadists have stolen several commercial jetliners in Libya, raising concerns with intelligence officials about 9/11-style terror strikes as the 13th anniversary approaches, some reports say.

The Algerian news site al-Fadjr on Aug. 6 said 11 aircraft went missing from Tripoli International Airport during fighting between militias, IHS Janes 360 reports, but says  the Algerian report was ""probably not credible."" 

Subsequently, Mohamed Frikha, CEO of the Tunisian airline company Syphax, told Tunisia's Shems FM Radio that two Airbus-A320 aircraft belonging to the Libyan company Ifriqiya were missing from Misratah, Janes reports.

Meanwhile, the Washington Free Beacon reports that information about stolen jetliners was circulated within the U.S. government over the past two weeks — including an ominous warning that one or more jets could be used in an attack marking the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist strikes in New York and Washington. 

""There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,"" one unnamed official told the Free Beacon. ""We found out on Sept. 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.""

Sept. 11 also will mark the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

Military groups in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt have all been placed on heightened alert because of the stolen jets, the Free Beacon reports.

Urgent: Should Obama Be Impeached? Vote Now in Urgent Poll 

U.S. counterterrorism officials told the Free Beacon that intelligence agencies haven't confirmed the missing aircraft and are trying to locate all of the aircraft owned by two Libyan state-owned airline companies.

Security in Libya has been deteriorating as Islamists and anti-Islamist militias battle. A shocking video surfaced Sunday showing armed fighters partying inside a captured U.S. diplomatic compound in Tripoli, including one fighter jumping into a pool from a second-story balcony. 

Michael Rubin, a counterterrorism specialist with the American Enterprise Institute, told the Free Beacon that commercial jets in the hands of terrorists could be ""devastating.""

""Who needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes? Even empty but loaded up with fuel they can be as devastating,"" he said. ""Each plane could, if deployed by terrorists to maximum devastating effect, represent 1,000 civilian casualties.""

Janes reported, however, that it was ""very unlikely"" that aircraft could have been taken from Tripoli International Airport without the knowledge of the Zintan militias that control it. 

With Misratah and Mitiga airports the only two functioning international airports in western Libya, Janes added, ""Misratan Islamist militias that control them will not want to jeopardize the political influence and revenue this affords them"" by facilitating a 9/11-style attack.

Even if the jihadists stole the aircraft,""they would still need to transport the jets to other paved runways large enough to facilitate takeoff ... heightening the risk such movements would be spotted by foreign intelligence agency surveillance.""

1157,Nun complains of stomach pains... and GIVES BIRTH: Sister who had 'no idea' she was pregnant has a baby boy at hospital in Italy,"FORT DEVENS, Massachusetts -

Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, was the victim of an “unfortunate accident” yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just weeks after his high-profile trial began, according to warden Paul Jacobson.

Corrections officers reportedly found the alleged terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby.

“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. “We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”

“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. “The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”

“Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence,” said warden Jacobson. “Because of the nature of Tsarnaev’s crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev were both suspected of perpetrating the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15, 2013. The bombings killed three people and reportedly injured as many as 264 others. Shortly after the FBI named the two suspects and released images of them, the two brothers reportedly killed an MIT police officer and carjacked an SUV in a shootout with police. During the shootout, the elder brother, Tamerlan was captured but was killed when his brother drove over him with the SUV. On the evening of April 20, 2013, the wounded Dzhokhar was found unarmed and hiding in a boat on a trailer in Watertown, Massachusetts.

On January 30, 2014, United States Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the federal government would seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev. The trial had just begun on January 5, 2015, as Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him.",unrelated

Among them was a Quarter Pounder with cheese they’d bought for another kid. That kid never turned up, but they didn’t eat his burger . Ever.

Now the boys have become men and the burger has turned 20.

1159,‘Jihadi John’: The Islamic State killer behind the mask is a young Londoner,"A Guantanamo Bay prisoner released last year as part of an exchange for captured US serviceman Bowe Bergdahl has resumed contact with the Taliban, according to reports.

The former detainee - one of five men released in a controversial deal which saw the return of the US PoW from Afghanistan - is said to have been in touch with members of the al-Qaeda linked Haqqani network.

This is the first suggestion that any of the detainees involved in the swap may be trying to engage again in militant activity.

The five, who mostly held mid- to high-level positions within the Taliban before their capture during the early days of the US-led war in Afghanistan, were detained because of their association with the terror group.

Since their release they have been living in Qatar, which promised to monitor the men on behalf of the US.

The Pentagon said Thursday that it is working with Qatar and is confident that any threat posed by the former detainees can be mitigated.

US Sen Lindsey Graham, who recently visited Qatar, said he had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country, but said he was assured during his visit that all five remain in the small Gulf nation.

Qatar gained public praise from President Barack Obama for brokering the controversial deal in May 2014 that freed Army Sgt. Bergdahl from Taliban captivity in exchange for the release of the five senior Taliban officials who had been imprisoned for years at the US-run Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.

Qatar promised Mr Obama it would keep the five under watch for one year, although they would then be free to leave.

""It's just a year deal,"" Mr Graham told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ""Just as sure as we're sitting here, they're going back to the fight.""

""They've had some Haqqani people come to meet with them. ... They're reaching out. The Taliban five are communicating with people inside Afghanistan.""

However, Mr Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a leading Capitol Hill voice on foreign policy, said all five are still in Qatar.

""I was afraid one had left, but they told me they're all still there,"" he said.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it would not comment on specific cases involving the detainees.

""However, we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously, and we work in close coordination through military, intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary,"" the statement said. ""The Defense Department has a close security partnership with the government of Qatar. We're confident in our ability to continue to mitigate any threat that may be posed by the former Guantanamo detainees.""

The San Diego Republican said U.S. Border Patrol ""sources"" told him that ""at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""

""If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border -- it’s that simple,"" he said. ""They caught them at the border, therefore we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or 10 of them then you know there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,"" he said on Fox News’ ""On the Record with Greta Van Susteren.""

""ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons,"" he added. ""The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming through the southern border -- which they already have.""

Two of the country's top intelligence officials said last month they had no credible evidence to support the theory that militants are operating next door, nor that they are plotting to sneak across the border.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that Hunter's claim otherwise was ""categorically false.""

""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron told The Huffington Post. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

Hunter, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, isn't the first member of Congress to raise the alarm about the prospect of extremists crossing the border. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) suggested last month that such infiltration was possible, and Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) said it was already happening. Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) has also sounded similar notes about terrorists crossing his state's border from Mexico. GOP Rep. Tom Cotton, who is running for the U.S. Senate in Arkansas, claimed Tuesday that extremists were actively collaborating with Mexican drug cartels to infiltrate the U.S. border and attack Arkansans.

Asked for comment on Wednesday, a spokesman for Hunter said the information came for a ""high level source"" and that DHS was ""actively discouraging any talk of IS on the border.""

""The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,"" Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper told The Huffington Post.

1161,Iraqi media says ISIS militants have contracted Ebola,"A baseball cap and a portrait of Michael Brown is shown alongside his casket inside Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church before the start of funeral services in St. Louis, Missouri. Photo: Reuters

Ferguson: An audio recording released on Tuesday morning may shed light on the death of a Missouri teenager fatally shot by a police officer August 9, which have sparked protests that resumed this week.

The tape, provided to CNN, allegedly contains audio captured during a Ferguson resident's video chat at the time of the shooting. CNN says the authenticity of the tape has yet to be verified, but what appears to be gunfire can be heard in the background of the call.

As many as 10 shot-like sounds can be heard. Several shots are fired in what appears to be fairly quick succession. There is a brief pause, then more shots are fired.

An autopsy concluded that Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times, with two fatal shots to the head. The Ferguson officer involved has been identified as Darren Wilson, 28.

Law enforcement officials and bystanders have provided differing accounts of what led to the fatal encounter. Police say Mr Wilson stopped Brown and a friend for walking in the street, asking the two to move to the sidewalk, and words were exchanged. According to Mr Wilson's account, he was attacked by Brown as he attempted to exit his cruiser and the two scuffled for the officer's gun inside the car.

Both Mr Wilson and witnesses concede Brown took off running. The witnesses say the officer fired on the unarmed teen as he had his hands up to surrender. Wilson supporters say Brown was bull-rushing Wilson, who shot Brown in self-defense.

The shooting ignited racial tensions, sparking several days and nights of protests, riots, looting and unrest, which have resumed.

More than 100 demonstrators marched in St. Louis on Tuesday demanding the arrest of a white police officer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.

The protesters, who called for Mr Wilson's arrest and the removal of Ferguson police leaders, were blocked from walking up the courthouse steps by a group of officers, most on bicycles.

Few signs were visible at what has been the centre of the protests along West Florissant in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb.

A man under a gazebo sold T-shirts that read ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" the chant favoured by demonstrators, as the temperature reached 34 Celsius at midday.

People gathered in small groups at the impromptu memorial set up where Brown died and two women handed out food from a folding table.

""This community has had a story to tell for a long time and this has just been the catalyst,"" said Chelsea Warlick, 29, a photographer from Savannah, Georgia. The majority of people in Ferguson are black, while most of its elected officials and police force are white.

Ms Warlick, who laid white roses by the memorial, said she was about to sign a six-month lease on an apartment in the complex where Brown lived to support the community.

""The verdict is everything. If he doesn't go to jail for what he did this place is going to burn,"" she said of Mr Wilson.

The Missouri National Guard, which began a gradual pullout from Ferguson on Friday, was absent from a spot on West Florissant they had occupied late on Monday.

Brown's funeral service was Monday, and the case is currently being presented to a grand jury. Attorney General Eric Holder has promised a thorough investigation.

The organisation Black Lawyers for Justice plans to file a $US200 million class action lawsuit against Ferguson authorities Tuesday, KDSK-TV reported. According to the organisation's website, the group's mission is to fight police brutality.

1162,HORROR: ISIS Fighters Have Reportedly Contracted Ebola,"A spokesman for the Iraqi health ministry denied reports in a local newspaper that militants in Mosul had Ebola

Reports that Isis fighters in Iraq have contracted Ebola have been refuted as “incorrect” and “unfounded” by the country’s health ministry.

Despite reports on Wednesday in the Iraqi paper, al-Sabah, that two cases of Ebola had been reported in Mosul in the north of the country, Ahmed Rudaini, the health ministry’s spokesman dismissed the speculation.

He said the disease could not have been registered, as only the Central Laboratory of Public Health in Baghdad has the “diagnostic capabilities” to confirm cases of Ebola which was reported by the al-Maalomah news website and the International Business Times.

The World Health Organisation also confirmed that they had received no confirmation of Ebola cases from Iraq.

Tarik Jasarevic from the organisation told The Independent: ""WHO is aware of these reports and is working closely with Iraqi MoH to get more information.

""It is unlikely that this case can be a confirmed Ebola case as there is no laboratory facility in Mosul that could do an Ebola test.""

WHO’s director of communications, Christy Feig had earlier told Mashable: “We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.”

The organisation has reached out to the Iraqi government to investigate the claims, should it require assistance, however.

Al-Sabah initially reported that “terrorists” from several unnamed African countries had brought the virus to the country and claimed that two cases of Ebola and 26 cases of HIV/AIDS had been registered by authorities.

Although Isis has recruited foreign fighters in the past, it believed that the majority came from Tunisia, according to a Washington Post report. Very few, if any, militants are thought to have travelled from at-risk areas of West Africa, including Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

The northern city of Mosul fell to Isis six months ago and residents have suffered brutal repression. People are restricted from leaving the city without first nominating a guarantor, water and food supplies are limited and hospitals have been closed due to a lack of electricity.",discuss

Tim Cook and crew aren't likely to make a big deal of Power Reserve at Apple's March 9th event, assuming it shows up, but it could be one of the Watch's most important real-world features.

1164,Saudis Say Michelle Obama Not Blurred on TV,"A small furor has erupted over whether a Saudi television station blurred out the image of U.S. first lady Michelle Obama in the broadcast of her and President Barack Obama’s meeting with new Saudi King Salman today in Riyadh. Saudi officials deny the claim.

The new king shook hands with President Obama at the Erga Palace but didn’t acknowledge the first lady during a brief meeting at the funeral for King Abdullah. Barack and Michelle Obama cut short their trip to India to attend the funeral.  

Several videos posted on Saudis' Facebook pages obscured Michelle Obama's face. They were removed shortly after they were posted. I captured a screenshot of one such video before it was taken down. The Arab news service Mashahead posted on YouTube a video allegedly taken from the Saudi government television broadcast showing the blurred spot.

However,  Nail al-Jubeir, information director at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, e-mailed me that ""Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred."" CNN's Hala Gorani tweeted that her colleague Nic Robertson, in Riyadh, saw non-blurred images on Saudi TV. Other news organizations, such as Al Jazeera, showed the meeting without obscuring Michelle Obama’s face.


 

The alleged blurring wasn't the only controversy.  Some Arab media outlets criticized Michelle Obama for wearing a blue dress, rather than a black one. Videos of the short meeting between Salman and President Obama showed the king leaving in the middle of the protocol, abruptly turning around and walking away, in order to go to prayer.

After the meeting, Barack Obama and Salman held a bilateral meeting that included Secretary of State John Kerry, Senator John McCain, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Ambassador Joseph Westphal and CIA director John Brennan.

According to the White House pool report, “Obama and Salman sat in gold chairs. A small table in front of them held a spray of white flowers.”

Obama praised the late king in a statement following his death, saying “King Abdullah's vision was dedicated to the education of his people and to greater engagement with the world.” In an interview with CNN before the visit, Obama explained why he was hesitant to press the new king about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, which includes restricting the rights of women.

""Sometimes we have to balance our need to speak to them about human rights issues with immediate concerns that we have in terms of countering terrorism or dealing with regional stability,"" Obama said.

1165,New Audio Shows Michael Brown Was Shot at 11 Times,"MOGADISHU, Somalia — Al-Shabaab’s top leader was traveling in one of two vehicles hit Monday night in a US military strike, a member of the Somali Islamic extremist group said Tuesday.

The spokesman would not say whether al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane was among the six militants killed.

The two vehicles were heading toward the coastal town of Barawe, al-Shabaab’s main base, when they were hit, Abu Mohammed told the Associated Press. A witness in Somalia described ground-shaking explosions in the strike.

Al-Shabaab attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people, a year ago this month, and the US targeted planners of the bloody assault. US commanders were waiting to determine the attack’s outcome.

“US military forces conducted an operation in Somalia today against the al-Shabaab network. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate,” said Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby.

After the US strike in a forest south of Mogadishu, masked Islamic militants in the area arrested dozens of residents they suspected of spying for the US and searched nearby homes, a resident said.

“Mass arrests just started, everyone is being detained,” said Mohamed Ali, who lives in the Sablale district. “They even searched nearby jungles and stopped the nomads transporting milk and grass to the towns for questioning.”

A senior Somali intelligence official said a US drone targeted Godane as he left a meeting of the group’s top leaders. Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is the group’s spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al Qaeda. In 2012, the US offered a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his arrest.

The Somali official, speaking on condition of anonymity since he was not authorized to speak to the media, said intelligence indicated Godane “might have been killed along with other militants.” The official said the attack took place 105 miles (170 kilometers) south of Mogadishu, where al-Shabaab trains its fighters.

As government and African Union forces were heading to a town in the district, they heard what sounded like an “earthquake” as the al-Shabaab bases were hit, the governor of Somalia’s Lower Shabelle region, Abdiqadir Mohamed Nor, told the Associated Press.

“There was an airstrike near Sablale. We saw something,” Nor said.

The US has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia in recent years.

A US missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabaab, and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a US strike that killed al-Shabaab’s top explosives expert.

The latest US action comes after Somalia’s government forces regained control of a high-security prison in the capital that was attacked Sunday. Seven heavily armed suspected al-Shabaab members had attempted to free other extremists held there.

Somali officials said all seven attackers, three government soldiers and two civilians were killed. Mogadishu’s Godka Jilacow prison is an interrogation center for Somalia’s intelligence agency, and many suspected militants are believed to be held in underground cells there. The attack started when a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison and the gunmen then fought their way into the prison.

Al-Shabaab had attacked the mall in Nairobi last year in retaliation against Kenya for sending troops into Somalia against the extremists. Godane said at the time that the attack was carried out in retaliation for the West’s support for Kenya’s Somalia intervention and the “interest of their oil companies.”

Al-Shabaab is now mostly active in Somalia’s rural regions after being ousted from the capital by African Union forces in 2011.

Somali military officials last week launched a military operation to oust al-Shabaab from its last remaining bases in the southern parts of Somalia. On Saturday the militants withdrew from the town of Bulomarer, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Mogadishu, after hours of fighting.",unrelated
1166,Report: Christian Bale Just Bailed on the Steve Jobs Movie,"It was less than two weeks ago that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin was gushing over Christian Bale as the best actor on the board in a certain age range” and his ideal choice to play Apple founder Steve Jobs in a new biopic. He said he “couldn’t be more excited” to have cast him in the role. Now, according to The Hollywood Reporter, Bale has dropped out of the project.

Sources told THR that “after much deliberation and conflicting feelings” Bale “came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw.” Before Bale was given the chance to turn down the role, it was reportedly offered to Leonardo DiCaprio, who also declined.

Meanwhile, it was reported last week that Seth Rogen is set to play Jobs’ co-founder Steve Wozniak. But without a signed deal with producer Scott Rudin, that casting could definitely change as well.

With Bale and DiCaprio out of the picture, what appropriately-aged, Oscar-calibar actor who looks enough like Steve Jobs could be left? And whatever you do, don’t say Ashton Kutcher.

In the order was a Quarter Pounder with cheese they had bought for a friend.

Now 20 years later, it remains under lock and key and bears an uncanny resemblance to its far fresher contemporaries.

""We're pretty sure it's the oldest burger in the world,"" Mr Dean said.

""It started off as a joke, you know we told our friend we'd hold his burger for him but he never turned up and before we knew it six months had passed.

""The months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.""

The pair showed off the mould-free specimen on The Project tonight, teasing that they might take a bite after all these years in the name of charity.

What We Know So Far

Updates

The Guardian posted this enhanced audio of Emwazi’s voice from a January 2015 video:

w.soundcloud.com

Cage UK, a counter-terrorism activist group which had discussions with Emwazi before he left for Syria, has issued a statement blaming British foreign policy for his radicalisation:

“Like Michael Adebolajo, suffocating domestic policies aimed at turning a person into an informant but which prevent a person from fulfilling their basic life needs would have left a lasting impression on Emwazi. He desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation, but the system ultimately rejected him.”

“We now have evidence that there are several young Britons whose lives were not only ruined by security agencies, but who became disenfranchised and turned to violence because of British counter-terrorism policies coupled with long standing grievances over Western foreign policy.

“This case should trigger thinking about British domestic and foreign policy. What risk assessments, if any, have been made about British counter-terrorism policy and the key part it plays in radicalising individuals? How have the security services been allowed to get away with abusing British citizens without redress? Why are the long-standing grievances over Western interventions in the Muslim world been ignored?

One of Emwazi’s neighbours in Queen’s Park, who identified himself only as Abdullah, told reporters that the family seemed very normal.

He added that he had lived in the block for three years, but had had very little interaction with the Emwazis.  Carl Court / Getty Images

“Jihadi John” appeared in multiple ISIS videos, threatening hostages who would later be killed.

Peter Kassig, a US aid worker, killed in December 2014.

David Cawthorne Haines, a Scottish aid worker, killed in September 2014.

Alan Henning, a British aid worker, killed in October 2014.

The naming of Emwazi appears to discredit earlier reports naming “Jihadi John” as Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a London rapper.

Telegraph

The jihadist fighter was previously named as the most likely of three suspects being investigated by the British security services. Abdel Bary is, however, believed to be an ISIS fighter, having been pictured holding the severed head of a prisoner in Syria.

British officials are not pleased with the decision to identify “Jihadi John”. David Cameron’s spokesman has declined to confirm his identity.

No 10 will not confirm or deny that Jihadi John is Mohammed Emwazi, but cautions against work of security services being jeopardised

Reporters were also told that MI5’s work could be affected by the decision to out Emwazi.

Reporters are gathering outside the flat in Queen’s Park where Emwazi’s family are believed to live.

Emwazi has been previously named in UK court documents as having connections to a network of Islamist extremists based in Somalia.

Jihadi John: Here's one of the court documents that includes Emwazi, the man known to be the ISIS militant:

AFP

“Jihadi John”, the masked ISIS militant who featured in videos threatening the beheading of multiple hostages, has been identified as a west Londoner named Mohammed Emwazi by the BBC and the Washington Post, which cited Emwazi’s friends and individuals in the security services.

“Jihadi John” appeared in multiple videos wielding a knife and threatening ISIS hostages including journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, US national Peter Kassig, and Japanese nationals Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto Jogo.

Emwazi was described by the Washington Post as a computer science graduate from the University of Westminster.

The newspaper said Emwazi was born in Kuwait, is in his mid-twenties, and was depicted by those who knew him as someone who was “polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith”.

He was described as being from a well-off family, and as having spent several years working in Kuwait before heading to Syria in around 2012.

The newspaper said Emwazi had also operated under the name Muhammad ibn Muazzam, and that British security services questioned him in 2010.

An individual named Muhammad ibn Muazzam was identified by The Independent in May 2010 as having been questioned by security services with a friend after coming home from a safari in Tanzania.

“The men allege they were harassed by MI5, who warned them they were now on a terror watch list which prevented them travelling to any Muslim country,” The Independent reported at the time.

In the piece, the two men claimed they were “held for ‘days’ in inhumane detention on the orders of MI5”.

The Guardian has obtained emails in which Emwazi said MI5 attempted to recruit him. The newspaper wrote:

In emails seen by the Guardian, Emwazi said the British agent knew “everything about me; where I lived, what I did, and the people I hanged around with”. He then it is claimed attempted to “turn” Emwazi, asking: “Why don’t you work for us?”. When he refused MI5 said “life would be harder for you”.

Commander Richard Walton of the Metropolitan police’s Counter Terrorism Command unit has declined to confirm the identity of the jihadi, saying:

We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.",unrelated

1170,Islamic Militants Post Video Claiming to Show Beheading of U.S. Journalist,"The most expensive Apple Watch set to go on sale in April will have to cost around $10,000, according to analysis done by the timepiece blog Grail Watch.

That's mostly because the Apple Watch Edition has a frame made from solid 18-karat gold, which is very expensive.

Grail Watch notes that gold sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per ounce these days. By that measure, the Apple Watch Edition's frame would cost around $8,300 for the larger 42mm version, excluding all other costs.

That's assuming the watch's case is made from solid gold, not gold-plated. But the blog notes that Apple's marketing material never uses ""gold-plated"" or ""gold-filled,"" which is conventional terminology for gold-plated materials, and that Apple must abide by laws governing how jewelry makers describe their products.

The conventional wisdom so far has been that the Apple Watch Edition will cost $5,000. Apple has only announced the price of the low-end Apple Watch Sport, which will sell for $349.

But gold-framed luxury watches usually go for well above the $10,000 mark. Cartier's Tank MC lists for $22,000 and Jager-LeCoultre's Reverso Squadra Hometime lists for over $23,000.

Even if the Apple Watch Edition sells for less than its analog competitors, it will still be Apple's most expensive product.

Grail Watch predicts the larger Apple Watch Edition will go for $9,999, with the smaller version retailing for $7,999.",unrelated
1171,Gateway Pundit,"Islamic State group fighters seized at least one cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town, activists said today.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

A still from an Islamic State (ISIS) video, purportedly shows an IS militant displaying the content of a crate carrying grenades near the town of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey border

A U.S. military airdrop of weapons meant for Kurdish fighters fell into the hands of their jihadist foes near the Syrian battleground town of Kobane, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said

The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

On Tuesday, ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.'

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.

An American journalist has been killed in a car crash in Turkey just days after claiming she claimed the Turkish intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of Kobane.

Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'.

Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles.

Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'

Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network.

In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place.

Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally.

Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene.

A senior Western intelligence official told Fox News that 23-year-old London rapper Abde Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect believed to be Foley’s executioner.

U.S. intelligence officials are not commenting publicly on the reports, but a well-placed source told Fox News that Bary’s Egyptian-born father was extradited from London to the United States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Usama bin Laden and the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa.

Bary traveled to Syria last year to fight with ISIS, the source said.

Asya Abdullah, co-chair of the Democratic Union Party (PYD), who is in Kobane told Kurdish Question that a gas attack had taken place in an Eastern neighbourhood of the city tonight (21 Oct). Abdullah said that they didn't know where the gas had come from because there hadn' t been any explosions.

She said: ""It could have been a silent missile or a missile placed in the neighbourhood beforehand. Many people have lost consciousness and are struggling to breathe and see. We are investigating the situation but do not have the necessary technical equipment to do tests.""

Dr. Welat, one of four doctors in Kobane told Guney Yildiz, a journalist at BBC World that he suspected the chemical attack was either chlorine gas or phosphorous shells. Dr Welat said: ""We can't confirm a chemical attack without proper tests and ask that medical equipment be airdropped for this.""

A fisherman has reeled in a monster 19 stone catfish, which could be the biggest in the world caught with a rod and reel.

Dino Ferrari hooked the whopper wels catfish, which was 2.67m in length, last week in the Po Delta in Italy.

While the fish might set a new record for the biggest caught on a line, it is far from the heaviest ever landed. The biggest was 22st and 2.78m long, and was also from the Po Delta.

Wels catfish can grow as long as 4m and up to 62st. However, it is rare to catch one that is over two meters long.

The fish has a ferocious appetite and will consume anything it comes across. They have been filmed eating pigeons that get too close.

1184,Here Are Microsoft's New Robot Security Guards,"Islamic State leaders in Syria and Iraq are training their fighters to fly captured fighter jets in the hope of establishing an air force, it has been claimed.

The terror group are understood to have been carrying out test flights the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, according to a British-based organisation monitoring the Syrian Civil War.

Having captured three fighter jets from the Syrian military, ISIS are using Iraqi pilots who were once officers in Saddam Hussein's air force to train Syria-based militants to operate the warplanes.

The news comes as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula sought to mend its strained relations with ISIS, urging all jihadist groups operating in the Middle East to unite under the common cause of fighting against Western 'crusader' armies.

Fighter: It is not clear if ISIS' jets are equipped with weaponry nor if the pilots are able to fly long distances, but witnesses said the planes appear to have been seized from the Syrian Air Force (pictured)

Power: ISIS has been steadily building a full-equipped military - including large tanks, such as the one pictured here in Raqqa). Much of the equipment in their possession has been seized from Syrian regime forces

Show of strength: ISIS militants take part in a military parade along the streets of Raqqa earlier this year

ISIS' alleged test flights over the Aleppo countryside are understood to be the first time the terror group - which seized control of vast swathes of Syria and Iraq earlier this year - has taken to the air.

'They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for Saddam Hussein,' said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

'People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,' he said, citing witnesses near al-Jarrah military airport.

The airport, which was seized from the Syrian regime earlier this year, is approximately 45 miles from the Turkish border.

It is not clear if the jets are equipped with weaponry nor if the pilots are able to fly long distances, but witnesses said the planes appear to be Soviet-built MiG 21 or MiG 23 models.

Leader: News of ISIS' test flights comes as Al Qaeda - which has previously condemned ISIS for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with the group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured)

Declaration: Titled 'Statement on the Crusader Coalition', the document is Al Qaeda's strongest show of support for ISIS since leader Ayman al-Zawahiri denounced the group for the brutal tactics late last year

Islamic State militants have been almost entirely driven out of the Syrian city of Kobane following a remarkable fightback by Kurdish forces who vowed to either defeat the terrorists or die trying.

The extremists have abandoned all of their positions in the city, except for two small pockets of resistance in the east of the city, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal said.

As recently as Monday it looked as if the fall of Kobane was imminent.

The massively outgunned Kurdish fighters had been pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ISIS militants advancing into the suburbs, leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents facing rape and massacre.

But with the help of the most intense U.S. and Arab bombing raids of the anti-ISIS campaign so far, the Kurdish forces have been able to kill hundreds of militants over the past two days.

They have also managed to force the militants have not been killed to retreat further into the outskirts of the town.

News that ISIS have been almost entirely forced out of Kobane comes after two days of heavy air strikes by U.S. warplanes.

ISIS' alleged test flights come despite American and Arab warplanes carrying out dozens of bombing raids against the group in Syria.

The terrorists have regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and have overrun several military bases but this was the first time it had been able to pilot warplanes.

Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts had previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria, but the aircraft had appeared unusable, according to analysts and diplomats.

News of the test flights comes as Al Qaeda - which has previously condemned ISIS for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's group.

In a statement released today, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - the notorious terror collective's Yemen-based franchise - urged jihadists throughout the Middle East to put their differences aside, according to Charlie Winter, a researcher on jihad at counter-terrorism think-tank Quilliam

The document is understood to have called for Al Qaeda - who are represented in Syria by the Nusra Front and Khorasan terror groups - to stop fighting with ISIS, adding that the militants should instead focus on attacking Western 'crusader' forces and carrying out strikes on American targets.

Titled 'Statement on the Crusader Coalition', the document is Al Qaeda's strongest show of support for ISIS since leader Ayman al-Zawahiri denounced the group for the brutal tactics late last year.

Security: ISIS has been making gains around Ramadi in recent weeks against the embattled Iraqi military, despite ongoing U.S.-led coalition airstrikes on the militants

'We urge all Muslims to back their brethren, with their souls, money and tongues, against the crusaders,' the Al Qaeda statement reads.

It also urges Muslims to support 'whoever can weaken the Americans to weaken them militarily, economically, and media-wise.'

Earlier today, Iraqi officials in the western Anbar province said a curfew has been imposed in the provincial capital Ramadi over fears that the Islamic State group might try to advance on the city.

Sabah Karhout, the chairman of the Anbar provincial council, says the curfew began at midnight this morning as part of an effort to limit movement in and out of the city.

ISIS has been making gains around Ramadi in recent weeks against the embattled Iraqi military, despite ongoing U.S.-led coalition airstrikes on the militants.

Two Iraqi military officials, speaking anonymously because they are not authorized to brief the media, say major operations are underway in Salahuddin province to retake key areas from the Sunni militants around Tikrit and the Beiji oil refinery.

ISIS and allied Sunni militants seized the Anbar city of Fallujah, parts of Ramadi and large rural areas of Anbar early this year.

The loss of Fallujah - where American troops engaged in some of the heaviest fighting of the more than eight-year U.S.-led war in the country - foreshadowed the later loss of Iraq's second city of Mosul and much of the north.

Six senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a symbol of the terrorists' expanding influence among Islamist groups.

Withdrawing their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban's leader Mohammad Omar, the men - made up of the group's chief spokesman Shahidullah Shahid and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the Pakistani Taliban, but added they now consider themselves affiliates of ISIS.

The move is likely to have serious consequences for security in Pakistan, particularly near the Afghan border where all six of the men are based, leaving it open to the kind of violence and brutal oppression ISIS has employed in the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq under the group's control.

The official announcement of the six men's declaration of allegiance to ISIS came in the form of an audio recording that emerged on Wednesday. However rumours had been circulating for weeks that several senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban were set to declare their loyalty to al-Baghdadi.

'I show allegiance to the commander of faithful, Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Qureshi al Hussaini, and will listen and obey every order of you and will follow your orders regardless of what circumstances may be,' Shahid said in the recording.

There is now concern that other senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban may defect to ISIS, including the group's overall leader Maulana Fazlullah, who has previously voiced support for the terror group.

1185,Apple Watch battery will require nightly charging,"TOKYO — Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumors covering every possibility from a stroke to a coup d’etat, is merely recovering from ankle surgery, a South Korean newspaper has reported.

Kim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.

“I heard that Kim Jong Un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,” the source was quoted as saying, adding that he had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.

Such is the fascination with North Korea, the world’s most impenetrable country, that rumors spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.

Nevertheless, it is true that Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, causing speculation about his health. But the gossip mill started up again last week when Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since Sept. 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. It went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the “Great Successor,” as he is known, was in an “indisposed condition.”

“Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,” said the narrator of a documentary called “Improving the Lives of the People,” showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month. It aired just before the session of the assembly, North Korea’s quasi-parliament, was broadcast, the Daily NK Web site reported.

With Kim shown carting around heavy things, the narrator continued: “His whole body is drenched in sweat, but he does not stop working hard, instead showing concern for the health of the other workers.”

Separately, the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Workers’ Party, recently reported that Kim had “labored on,” visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather.

Outside commentators have guessed that Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.

Weibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China’s official papers, ran a commentary Monday titled “For those who make up rumors of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?”

“Netizens who have a radical opinion can’t represent the opinion of China and China’s attitude toward North Korea was not changed,” the paper said.

In Washington, U.S. officials said they had no information about North Korea’s leader. “I can just say that I have no confirmation of the reports,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. “We’ve seen them, but we don’t have any confirmation.”

In Beijing, a U.S. diplomat said Monday that North Korea has rejected U.S. efforts to discuss the detention of three Americans, Reuters reported. Glyn Davies, U.S. special representative for North Korean policy, who is visiting the region, said Pyongyang’s refusal to discuss the issue was a sign that it “doesn’t have an interest in coming back into the international system as a responsible country.”",unrelated
1186,Nigeria says it has deal with Boko Haram to release kidnapped girls,"Militant group Boko Haram is reportedly holding a German hostage who was kidnapped in July. The group's leader has also claimed that a report of a ceasefire with the Nigerian government was a ""lie.""
 Nigeria Boko Haram Abubakar Shekau Archiv
Nigerian militant group Boko Haram claims to be holding a German hostage who was kidnapped from the state of Adamawa in northeastern Nigeria earlier this summer.
Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau made the announcement in a video obtained by news agency Agence France Presse. Shekau reportedly claims in the video that his group is ""holding your German hostage.""
The kidnapping occurred on July 16 in the town of Gombi in northeastern Nigeria, where the German national was reportedly a teacher at a government training center. The German Foreign Ministry has thus far refused to comment on the video.
The news comes after two Germans who were working in Nigeria for the construction company Julius Berger came under attack by gunmen on October 24. One was shot dead and the other taken hostage and later released.
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was in Nigeria just this past week to conduct talks with government and business leaders.
 Nigeria Boko Haram soll offenbar entführte Mädchen freilassen
Violence and additional kidnappings have repeatedly overshadowed negotiations for the release of more than 200 abducted Nigerian schoolgirls
Shekau claims no ceasefire
The new video emerges as violence continues to cast doubt over ceasefire negotiations between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram, which has been leading a violent uprising in northern Nigeria since 2009.
The Nigerian government says negotiations are taking place to secure the release of more than 200 schoolgirls whose abduction last spring from the town of Chibok sparked international outrage.
But Shekau reportedly claims in the video that earlier claims of a ceasefire between Boko Haram and the government are false, and that the schoolgirls had converted to Islam and been married off.
""We did not negotiate with anyone... It's a lie. It's a lie. We will not negotiate. What is our business with negotiation? Allah said we should not,"" AFP reported Shekau as saying.
""We have married [the girls] off. They are in their marital homes,"" Shekau reportedly says in the video while laughing.
Nigeria for its part maintains that it is conducting ceasefire negotiations and discussions to release the kidnapped girls in neighboring Chad with supposed Boko Haram envoy, Danladi Ahmadu. Shekau allegedly says in the video that he does not know Danladi.
Violence continues
Meanwhile, a triple bombing of a bus station in the city of Gombe on Friday killed at least eight people and wounded 41. It is not yet clear if the attacks were carried out by Boko Haram, though the group has targeted commuters in the past.

Thousands of Nigerians have been killed as a result of the Boko Haram uprising
Boko Haram's insurgency has been characterized by a brutal campaign of bombings and shootings targeting Christian churches, Muslim mosques, schools, markets, bars, villages, police stations and a UN building. An estimated 5,000 Nigerians have been killed and a further 300,000 displaced by the violence.
In 2013, the Nigerian government declared a state of emergency in the northeastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. Amnesty International has accused the Nigerian military of war crimes, including extrajudicial killings, in its fight against Boko Haram. The United Nations and Human Rights Watch have also alleged that Nigeria's security forces have committed human rights abuses.
Nigeria's population of 177 million is 50 percent Muslim and 40 percent Christian. Muslims are concentrated in the north and Christians in the south.

1188,U.S. Hostage Luke Somers Killed During Yemen Rescue Bid: Family,"NEW YORK — Pope Francis has given hope to gays, unmarried couples and advocates of the Big Bang theory. Now, he has endeared himself to dog lovers, animal-rights activists and vegans.

Trying to console a little boy whose dog had died, Pope Francis told him in a recent public appearance on St Peter’s Square that “paradise is open to all of God’s creatures”. While it is unclear whether the Pope’s remarks helped soothe the child, they were welcomed by groups such as the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

In his relatively short tenure as leader of the world’s one billion Roman Catholics since taking over from Benedict XVI, Pope Francis, 77, has repeatedly caused a stir among conservatives in the church.

He has suggested more lenient positions than his predecessor on issues such as homosexuality, single motherhood and unwed couples.

Theologians cautioned that Pope Francis had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.

Reverend James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor-at-large of America, a Catholic magazine, said he believed that Pope Francis was at least asserting that “God loves and Christ redeems all of creation”, even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals. “He said paradise is open to all creatures,” Rev Martin said.

The question of whether animals go to heaven has been debated for much of the church’s history. Pope Benedict said during a 2008 sermon that when an animal dies, it “just means the end of existence on earth”.

Ms Christine Gutleben, senior director of the Humane Society, said Pope Francis’ apparent reversal of his predecessor’s view could be enormous. “If the Pope did mean that all animals go to heaven, then the implication is that animals have a soul. And if that is true, then we ought to seriously consider how we treat them because they mean something to God,” she said.

Ms Sarah Withrow King, director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA, one of the most activist anti-slaughterhouse groups, said the Pope’s remarks could move Catholics away from consuming meat. But there are differing views.

Mr Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, said in an email that it “certainly does not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin”. THE NEW YORK TIMES",unrelated

Hollywood actress Jessica Chastain - who is currently starring alongside Matthew McConaughey in Christopher Nolan's Interstellar - is also being courted for a role in the film, simply entitled Jobs.

Return of the Mac: Seth Rogen, left, is reportedly in talks to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, right, in the upcoming Steve Jobs biography, Jobs

Slumdog Millionaire film-maker Danny Boyle is to direct from a script by Aaron Sorkin, who used Steve Jobs' authorised biography by Walter Isaacson.

The film - which will reportedly not be a traditional biopic - is expected to follow the late technology whiz during three stressful and high profile product launches throughout Apple's history.

While talking with Bloomberg on Thursday, 53-year-old Aaron Sorkin revealed that British actor Christian Bale would be playing the title role in Jobs.

A new Jobs: Christian Bale has been cast as the lead in Aaron Sorkin's upcoming Steve Jobs biopic

Based on the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson, Jobs will feature Bale, 40, in every frame of the film.

But that daunting acting task doesn’t worry Sorkin, who cast Bale without even an audition and called the Dark Knight trilogy star a ‘phenomenal actor’ during the interview.

If this all seems familiar, that is because another biographical film – with the same name – about Steve Jobs came out in August 2013 to a great deal of fanfare.

Another Steve: Ashton Kutcher played Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in the 2013 film co-starring Josh Gad

Starring Ashton Kutcher, 36, as Jobs, that movie chronicled the Apple co-founder’s career from college in the 1970s through the introduction of the iPod in 2001.

Christian’s version, in contrast, will focus mostly on three major speeches Steve Jobs gave during his career.

‘What we needed was the best actor,’ Sorkin said of Bale, who won an Oscar for his supporting role in 2010’s The Fighter (filmed between instalments of Bale’s Batman movies).

Winner: Despite years of critically acclaimed roles, Bale won his first Academy Award for The Fighter in 2011

Christian was again nominated for an Oscar for 2013’s American Hustle and has been a critically acclaimed actor since starring in Steven Spielberg’s Empire Of The Sun at 14.

Despite being best known as a superhero, Bale is known for physically transforming himself thoroughly between roles and thus should be fine to take on the more cerebral Jobs role.

Before his death in 2011 from pancreatic cancer, Jobs gained a reputation as an excellent speaker, in addition to his work in creating and then transforming Apple Computers.

It’s a big leap from Batman to Jobs, but if there’s one actor who can play both muscle-bound Bruce Wayne and skinny Steve Jobs, it is Christian Bale.

""It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland,"" Edinburgh Evening News quoted Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch blog, as saying. He further explained that North Koreans consider Scotland, which leans more towards leftist ideals than England, more suitable to ""deal with"".
Moreover, the North Korean leader is said to have been keenly interested in Scottish affairs during the Referendum Debate of September 2014, wherein voters decided ""yes"" or ""no"" on ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"".
""Plus, North Koreans love whisky,"" said Madden, before elaborating, ""Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency"".

1194,Dog abandoned at Ayr station with belongings in suitcase,"Apple has remained mum as to its pricing strategy for the three versions of the Apple Watch to be made available next year, only saying that the price will start at $350 for the entry-level version, likely to be the Apple Watch Sport, which features light aluminum and a sweat-resistant band made from a rubbery material.

But jewelry industry experts believe the Apple Watch Edition, which comes with 18-karat yellow gold or rose gold, a sapphire crystal display and Venetian leather for its bands, will cost around $1,200, with other jewelers estimating that Apple's fanciest smartwatch could be priced as much as $10,000.

Watch expert Chad Rickicki of Pittsburgh, Penn. told TechCrunch that an 18-karat gold case that is the size and shape of the Apple Watch could rack up as much as $600 for the raw material. That does not even include the smartwatch's electronic components and the profit margin Apple plans to tack on to the device. All in all, consumers can expect to pay $1,200 for a gold smartwatch, says Rickicki.

However, other jewelers are not as optimistic, saying that we need to understand the materials Apple used for its smartwatch to be able to peg it at a more accurate price. Ariel Adams, founder and editor of watch blog aBlogtoWatch, says Apple adopted watch industry terminology for the Apple Watch. The term ""18-karat gold,"" he says, likely means the watch is made of solid gold, not gold-plated. Otherwise, Apple would have used the term ""gold-plated.""

The current market price for gold is $1,200 per ounce. If, for example, the Apple Watch weighs two ounces, that is already $2,400 just for the gold. That is not even considering the special process Apple's own metallurgists invented to create gold that is ""twice as hard as standard gold."" Adams says Apple has cheaper manufacturing centers in China than the facilities used by Swiss-based watchmakers, but gold is gold and it is expensive wherever it is crafted.

Adams also points out that there is also the cost of sapphire glass to contend with, estimating that Apple has to pay around $30 to $40 for the sapphire crystal case of the Edition smart watch. Sapphire manufacturing, Adams says, is a long and expensive process where the crystals are synthetically grown in large chambers and then cut into rectangles that are then laminated. Adams thinks the high-end Apple Watch will not cost anything less than $5,000 and could go up as much as $10,000.

""The Edition is going to be far, far less mass-produced than the steel version,"" he says. ""I think it's going to have a much different type of distribution. It'll be a much more exclusive product.""",unrelated

They then dumped the severed remains in the middle of a road and lefta bloodied Kumar nearby.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, said no one 'went to help' Kumar because they knew he had been punished for a 'sex crime'.

Mr Dhawan said: 'We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped.

'This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.'

But the police have called for those responsible to come forward, saying people can't take the law into their 'own hands'.

'We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.'

Kumar was eventually taken to hospital where doctors described his condition as critical.

The girl involved was treated for shock, and given counselling.

The castration follows a string of violent sex crimes in India that have prompted vigilante justice.

In July, one man was killed and two others were badly hurt after being accused of raping and hanging a seven-year-old girl.

The girl was discovered hanging from a tree near the village of Kaliabazar, West Bengal, and angry villagers quickly rounded up a local 'Tantrik' holy man and his two friends.

The trio were mercilessly beaten. One later died in hospital and the two others required extensive treatment.

1198,"Stainless steel Apple Watch could cost just $499, but gold will be 10 times as pricey","When Apple introduced its Apple Watch in September, the company said there would be three editions along with various face options and bands. Customers will literally have dozens of watch configurations to choose from. Only the base model got an official price of $349, however. Now a report claims to have pricing information on other editions.

MacRumors spotted a French blog whose sources suggest the stainless steel Apple Watch variant will start at $500 while gold models could cost $4,000 and up. The iGen blog has been credible in the past, correctly predicting the size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

If you take the view that Apple Watch is simply another smartwatch or gadget, the prices may not make that much sense. Look at the device as a fashion statement with smarts, though, and the anticipated costs sound viable. Apple has designed the watch and will market it as a modern timepiece that adds smartwatch functions to your wrist. It’s already considered a luxury brand by many and people are clearly willing to pay premium prices for that brand.

The stainless steel pricing is certainly believable to me. Look at Pebble to see why.

Pebble Steel fashion

 


You can buy a plastic Pebble smartwatch for as little as $99 now, recently discounted from its $149 price. The same watch and functionality in a more aesthetically pleasing stainless steel case will cost you $199, or double the plastic model’s price. It’s reasonable to assume an Apple Watch with stainless steel casing will cost $500 based on that. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see that come with a leather strap, with an additional $50 to $100 cost for a matching stainless steel strap.

Unfortunately, we’re not likely to know the official retail costs until this coming spring, as Apple won’t be selling the Apple Watch until then. For now, potential customers have time to save up for Apple’s timepiece — something they may need to do if they want an Apple Watch in gold.",discuss
1199,Lebanon confirms holding ISIS chief’s kin,"Dramatic footage from an Afghanistan battlefield shows the moment a U.S. Marine survived a bullet to his head, thanks to his kevlar helmet.

According to Sam Arnold, who posted the video on YouTube, the footage was recorded on a helmet camera during a “joint helicopter raid” in the Now Zad district of Helmand Province in 2013.

At the start of the incredible three-minute video, gunfire is heard in the background, and three Marines decide to try to find out where the shots came from. They pass through a tunnel stocked with barrels and wood, and peek through a doorway on the south side of the compound. Then, a bullet strikes one of the Marine’s helmets, knocking his head back. The three marines turn around and run back to their original position.

“Dude, you got shot,” says the Marine who caught the dramatic event on camera. “I saw it hit your kevlar.”

“I did get shot,” the other Marine replies. He seems remarkably calm, but a little dazed. His only complaint is that his ears are ringing.

“Lucky son of a b—h,” says the one with the camera.

1200,Pentagon: Airstrike killed terror leader in Somalia,"Aaron Sorkin's upcoming film about former Apple CEO Steve Jobs has reportedly found its Steve Wozniak: Seth Rogen.

The news, first reported by Variety on Thursday, comes just one week after Sorkin confirmed that Christian Bale will portray Jobs in the Sony Pictures film, which is based on Walter Isaacson's biography of the late tech luminary.

Sony did not immediately respond to Mashable's request for comment about the casting report, but Rogen is no stranger to working with Sony. He previously starred in the studio's This Is the End last year and will star in The Interview in December.

This is the seventh film Sorkin has written, including The Social Network in 2010. It will be told in three sequences focusing on Apple's launches of the iPod, NeXT and the Macintosh.

The movie — like Open Roads' Jobs flick starring Ashton Kutcher as as the titular character and Josh Gad as Wozniak did — will explore Jobs' life, particularly his relationships.

""It’s not a biopic; it’s not the story of Steve Jobs — it’s something much different than that,"" Sorkin said in April. ""He’s a fascinating guy — part hero, part antihero... He’s a fascinating guy surrounded by fascinating people, and he had very interesting relationships with the people in his life.""

Steve Jobs passed away on Oct. 5, 2011. Sorkin confirmed this year that he finished the film's script.

""It will be up to the audience whether it’s good or not,"" Sorkin said. ""But Steve Jobs is one of the very few times I ended up writing what I set out to write. It’s an incredibly satisfying feeling.""

Wozniak was critical of Gad's portrayal (""personalities are very wrong although mine is closer""), so it will be fascinating to see what he has to say about Rogen.

Steve Jobs introduces the Macintosh to the world. Computing would never be the same.

Ridley Scott's famous ""1984"" commercial for the original Macintosh continues to find imitators, even today. In 2011, Motorola attempted to spoof the classic ad in a promotional spot for its Xoom tablet.

When Bill Gates appeared on-screen at Macworld Boston in 1997, the audience reacted with boos and hisses. Still, the decision to partner with Microsoft and have Microsoft commit to producing software for the Macintosh was one of the most shrewd -- and likely one of the most intelligent -- decisions that Jobs made upon his return to Apple.

Although many incorrectly believe that Microsoft ""bought"" Apple in 1997, the reality is, without Microsoft's investment and commitment to developing Macintosh software, the company may have had a more difficult time getting its next line of products to the market.

The iMac helped set the standard for the modern Apple even as we know it today. Designed by Jonathan Ive, the iMac was sleek, modern and affordable. This was not the Macintosh of the early to mid 1990s, it was something new.

With the iMac, Apple became cool. We can vividly remember looking at the egg-shaped all-in-one design with the hockey puck mouse and famous lack of a floppy drive and being transfixed. The iMac marked the beginning of Apple 2.0.

Nearly 10 years ago, Apple debuted the iPod. Famously ridiculed and dismissed by Slashdot, it would be several years before the device would become iconic, and in the process, change Apple fundamentally as a company.

The premise behind the iPod was simple: 1,000 songs in your pocket. Its the execution that set the device apart from everyone else.

In 2003, Apple flipped the switch again, with the launch of the iTunes Music Store. In a post-Napster industry, most were skeptical that iTunes could drive music sales. Eight years later, iTunes is the number one music retailer by a large margin.

Ten years on, the iPod is getting long in the tooth, but it still remains the leader in its product category.

After the iPod started to achieve massive success in 2003 and 2004, the rumors of an iPod phone started to swirl.

The first attempt to bring a product like that to the market was in the form of Motorola's Rokr. The Rokr tried to capitalize on the success of the Razr, while also adding compatibility with iTunes.

Still, the device was a dud. You can see Steve Jobs's frustration with the device in this demonstration. The Rokr was an example that only Apple could build an Apple product.

Steve Jobs's commencement speech at Stanford University in 2006 is one of our favorite Jobs moments. It's riveting, inspirational and every bit as good as any Apple product keynote.

All hail the Jesus Phone. The iPhone changed the mobile industry. Full stop. The mobile world and ecosystem that we know today would not exist in the same way that it does now without the iPhone.

The iPhone also changed Apple as a company and helped further cement Jobs's place in history.

Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are two of the most powerful and influential men of our times. Seeing them together at D5, just ahead of the iPhone's U.S. launch, was amazing.

In January 2010, Apple changed the game again with the iPad. Like the iPod and iPhone, the critics dismissed it and predicted its failure. Its success has outpaced nearly every other technology product launch in history and is having a seismic impact on education, publishing, media consumption and computing in general.

The PC era might not be over, but I'm willing to bet that the computer I use every day in 10 years will have a lot more in common with the iPad than the MacBook Pro.",unrelated
1201,Audio recording allegedly captures at least 10 shots fired in Michael Brown killing,"An audio recording released Tuesday morning may shed light on the death of a Missouri teenager fatally shot by a police officer Aug. 9.

The tape, provided to CNN, allegedly contains audio captured during a Ferguson resident's video chat at the time of the shooting. CNN says the authenticity of the tape has yet to be verified, but what appears to be gunfire can be heard in the background of the call.

As many as 10 shot-like sounds can be heard. Several shots are fired in what appears to be fairly quick succession. There is a brief pause, then more shots are fired.

An autopsy concluded that Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times, with two fatal shots to the head. The Ferguson officer involved has been identified as Darren Wilson, 28.

Law enforcement officials and bystanders have provided differing accounts of what led to the fatal encounter. Police say Wilson stopped Brown and a friend for walking in the street, asking the two to move to the sidewalk, and words were exchanged. According to Wilson's account, he was attacked by Brown as he attempted to exit his cruiser and the two scuffled for the officer's gun inside the car.

Both Wilson and witnesses concede Brown took off running. The witnesses say the officer fired on the unarmed teen as he had his hands up to surrender. Wilson supporters say Brown was bull-rushing Wilson, who shot Brown in self-defense.

The shooting ignited racial tensions, sparking several days and nights of protests, riots, looting and unrest.

Brown's funeral service was Monday, and the case is currently being presented to a grand jury. Attorney General Eric Holder has promised a thorough investigation.

The organization Black Lawyers for Justice plans to file a $200 million class action lawsuit against Ferguson authorities Tuesday, KDSK-TV reported. According to the organization's website, the group's mission is to fight police brutality.

A press conference is set for 1 p.m. CT Tuesday at the U.S. District court building in St. Louis.

1202,Luke Somers 'killed in failed rescue attempt in Yemen',"The Canadian government said on Sunday it was investigating reports that a Canadian-Israeli woman who joined Kurdish militias fighting in northern Syria has been captured by Islamic State (Isis) fighters.

According to a blog linked to Isis, several female fighters who fought alongside the Kurds have been taken prisoner, including Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian-born resident of Tel Aviv. Israel Radio reported Kurdish sources denying the claims, saying Rosenberg was not in the area when it was attacked.

A Canadian government spokesman said in a statement his country was “pursuing all appropriate channels” as it sought further information and was in touch with local authorities.

Asked by an Israeli television station about the reports, the Israeli defence minister, Moshe Ya’alon, said: “I cannot confirm that and I hope that it isn’t true.” The Shin Bet, Israel’s general security service, told the Jerusalem Post: “There are no further details at this stage”.

Rosenberg, 31, joined Kurdish troops fighting Isis earlier this month. A former pilot who served in the Israeli Defence Force (IDF), she reportedly contacted Kurdish fighters over the internet before travelling through Iraq to train at one of their camps on the Syrian border.

In an interview with Israel Radio aired in November, Rosenberg said she was training with Kurdish guerrillas with the intention of fighting in Syria. “They are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really,” she said.

On 20 November, a message posted to a Facebook page in Rosenberg’s name said: “My Facebook account and friend requests are being managed by someone else until I have access again in apx [sic] 2 weeks time on or around week of [8 December]. Please do not message as this is not me. Thank you.”

1205,Isis claims to behead US journalist,"Islamist militants claim to have beheaded a man identified as James Foley, an American journalist kidnapped in Syria in late 2012, in a graphic video posted on the internet.
A spokeswoman for the White House said the intelligence community was trying to determine the video’s authenticity. “If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American

The video entitled “Message to #America (from the #IslamicState)” purporting to show “James Wright Foley” on his knees ahead of his execution by a man whose identity is disguised and who speaks with a distinct British accent.


At the end of the video, the same person holds up a second person, who is identified with a caption on the screen as Steven Sotloff, a journalist kidnapped in 2013, and says: “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.”
Last week, social media accounts controlled by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or Isis, uploaded videos showing dozens of beheadings of individuals they accused of being sympathisers of the regime of Bashar al-Assad, President of Syria, in the northern Syrian town of Deir Ezzor.
The posting of the latest video by Isis comes days after President Barack Obama ordered an intensifying series of air strikes on the militants in northern Iraq.
The immediate aim of the strikes was to back Kurdish and Iraqi forces in their efforts to retake Mosul Dam, a strategic asset which the militants had gained control of in their recent military surge.
Mr Obama has said that Washington will not send troops to Iraq to engage Isis in combat but administration officials have expanded the US military mission there over the last week to halt and push back the militant’s advance.
“We believe that Isis needs to be taken out,” Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said this week.
An estimated 500 Britons have travelled to fight with extremist groups in Syria – most from London – and almost all have joined Isis, according to UK security officials.
British intelligence believes that several have travelled into Iraq and that some have almost certainly been involved in the worst of Isis’ atrocities.
The apparent murder of Mr Foley is a violent reminder of some of the most graphic crimes committed by Isis’s predecessor organisation, al-Qaeda in Iraq, which gruesomely beheaded dozens of Iraqis and foreigners, uploading videos of the acts to the internet, under the command of the militant group’s then leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, nearly a decade ago.
The beheading of American citizen Nicholas Berg in 2004 by Mr Zarqawi himself propelled AQI to the forefront of the war on terror and marked the beginning of a new particularly bloody phase in the Iraqi extremist insurgency in the wake of the US-led invasion.
AQI’s other high profile victims included Americans Jack Hensley and Eugene Armstrong, Briton Kenneth Bigley and South Korean Kim Sun Il.
Mr Zarqawi was killed in northern Iraq in 2006 in a US air strike, and AQI was subsequently driven underground by a surge in American troops in Iraq and a groundswell of Sunni support – financed by the West – in fighting the jihadi group.
The core of AQI’s ideological and operational beliefs and practices has survived in Isis however. The group has inherited many of the hallmarks of AQI, and has been posting videos of beheadings of Assad-regime soldiers and Iraqi Shia and Kurds online for months.
Early assessments by many in the Western intelligence community concluded that Isis was primarily a group focused on a violent regional and sectarian struggle.
With Isis’ declaration of a “caliphate” in June, however, and with it a direct challenge to what remains of al-Qaeda, many European and American security officials have grown more worried about its international ambitions.
Since air strikes against the group by the US began, intelligence officials have grown more worried over Isis’ attack planning against the West.
Of the estimated 3,000 Europeans who travelled to Syria to fight against Mr Assad’s regime, the majority have become Isis members and represent a potential terrorist risk to Western states.",discuss

1208,ISIS fighters 'have contracted Ebola': World Health Organisation investigating reports militants showed up at Iraqi hospital with lethal disease,"Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State are training its members in Syria to fly three captured fighter jets, according to a UK-based activist group that monitors the conflict.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said witnesses had seen the planes being flown around a military airport in Aleppo.

Meanwhile, Iraqi forces have launched an attack on IS militants near Tikrit.

The city was among the areas in Syria and Iraq seized by IS this year.

Rami Abdul Rahman, head of the SOHR, said IS was using Iraqi officers who were pilots under ex-Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to train fighters in Syria.

""People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,"" he said.

It is not known how many Iraqi pilots have defected.

Witnesses told the SOHR the planes appeared to be MiG-21 or MiG-23 models.

The BBC's Sally Nabil in Baghdad says IS has three planes which it captured earlier from the Syrian military in Aleppo and Raqqa.

US Central Command spokesman Col Patrick Ryder told Reuters the Pentagon was ""not aware"" of IS conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere.

Aleppo became a key battleground in the fight between Syrian rebels, which now include IS, and government forces after the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011.

New coordination

Separately, the Iraqi government said its troops had gained ground to the north and west of Tikrit and cut an important IS supply route.

Correspondents say that past efforts by the government to regain territory in the area have ended in failure.

Meanwhile Kurdish forces, backed by US-led air strikes, are continuing to fight militants in the northern Syrian town of Kobane.

US-led warplanes struck IS positions on Friday, taking advantage of new coordination with the town's Kurdish defenders.

The BBC's Kasra Naji, on the Turkish-Syria border, said the day began quietly but there had since been around six strikes.

On Thursday, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal told the BBC that the militants had been driven out of most of Kobane.

Our correspondent says refugees watching their town from a hilltop nearby agree that there are only two or three neighbourhoods that are still the scene of fighting.

The battle for Kobane, which is also known as Ayn al-Arab, is regarded as a major test of whether the US-led coalition's air campaign can push back IS.

Activists say more than 600 people have been killed since the jihadist group launched its assault on the mainly Kurdish town a month ago.

More than 160,000 people have fled in the face of the IS advance.

Capturing the town would give the group unbroken control of a long stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border.

Rosenberg, 31, a resident of Tel Aviv, joined the Kurdish troops against Islamic State in northern Syria earlier this month. According to reports, Rosenberg said she had contacted Kurdish fighters over the
Internet before traveling through Iraq to train at one of their camps on the Syrian border.

According to Walla, Rosenberg immigrated to Israel from Canada in 2006, leaving behind a career as a civilian pilot, and served for two years in the Israel Defense Forces. In 2009, she was extradited to the United States and jailed over an international phone scam, one of her former lawyers said.

Israel Radio aired an interview with Rosenberg earlier in November in which she said she had travelled to Iraq, was training with Kurdish guerrillas and would fight in neighboring Syria.

""They are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really,"" she told Israel Radio, explaining her decision to enter the combat zone in northern Syria.",agree

1211,REPORT: Apple's Watch Will Come In 2 Storage Sizes,"THIS is the terrible moment a desperately poor young woman tries to sell her son – to fund life-saving treatment for her daughter.

Mum Meng Xiangyan faced a real-life Sophie's Choice when poverty forced her to decide between her twins.

The distraught 29-year-old said that she and her husband loved both of their children.

But with certain death awaiting their daughter unless they could get medical treatment, they were prepared to sell their son to a good home so that both would have a chance of life.

Pictures published in local media show her standing on Weihai Road in Qingdao, which is a major city in eastern Shandong Province, Eastern China, with a placard offering to sell him to the highest bidder.

He was eating what appeared to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appealed for someone to come forward and buy the boy.

She said: ""Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

""But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukaemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives. It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.""

Medics say that the child is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital.

The family have sold up their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10 square metre flat close to where the therapies are being carried out. The parents are also struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal.

So far, there have been no offers on their son, who has not been named.

Their desperation follows on from a similar recent story in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband, Zhou Xinggui, are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter.

His wife's sign read: ""Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to sell my daughter and save my husband.""

In the four hours she sat with the sign, no-one bought her daughter.",unrelated

1213,Report: Israeli-Canadian woman fighting Islamic State has been kidnapped by terror group,"Tiger Woods isn't golfing. He's taking some time off to rest, to heal, and to work on his game. But according to one dude who probably doesn't know anything, it's all a coverup, and Woods is actually serving a secret Tour suspension for a failed drug test. Today, both the PGA Tour and Woods's agent flatly deny the claim.

The drug-test rumor came from occasional pro golfer Dan Olsen, and was made on a Lansing, Mich., sports talk radio show on Friday morning. Who the hell is Dan Olsen? Good question! He played a single full season on Tour in 2004, hasn't played a PGA event since 2011, and now mostly caddies and gives lessons. But he had this to say:

""I've heard that he's suspended. I heard he's on a month's suspension. And it's not, it's kind of a strong witness. It's a credible person that's telling me this. It's not testosterone, but it's something else. I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.""
That's a strong allegation to make, and Olsen had better be able to back it up. (He's not, but more on that in a bit.) Today, the PGA Tour said it's all horseshit.

""There is no truth whatsoever to these claims. We categorically deny these allegations,"" said Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour.
Woods's agent, too:

""These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,"" agent Mark Steinberg said. ""They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous.""
Olsen is walking back everything he said, telling ESPN.com his Friday comments were ""only my opinion and not based on any first-hand knowledge or facts."" Which is a claim that relies on a pretty loose definition of the word ""opinion.""

Olsen went on to say that ""I'll be looked at as just some crazy fucking nobody making accusations about Tiger,"" and it might have been the first true thing he's said in four days.",unrelated

A report published on the website of CCTV, a state broadcaster, offered readers practical advice on the selection of their Western-style name, a rite of passage for most young Chinese.

“Take heed,” the article said. “English names come with different connotations…A name can come with a 'feeling’ or idea about what sort of person you are.”

Names “with a distinct feeling of Britishness” such as Elizabeth, William and Catherine were considered as “safe” by the article, which was illustrated with a picture of the Royal family.

But other, less desirable name types were also listed, such as those derived from “suggestive” foods such as Candy, Lolly and Sugar which were “typically thought of as 'non-smart girl’ names, or 'stripper’ names.”

Picking the distinctive name of a world leader of celebrity such as Obama or Madonna, or that of a religious figure (“Satan”), was not advised.

In a discussion about the article on Observer, a news portal, one user suggested that the tradition could be short-lived. “Why get an English name?” Xiao Weixia wrote. “Just wait, everyone will get a Chinese name in the future.”",unrelated

1217,Questions raised over Nicaragua 'meteorite',"Some 219 years ago, founding fathers Sam Adams and Paul Revere looked on as a bit of history was tucked into a corner stone of the Massachusetts State House. On Thursday, excavators carefully extracted the keepsakes, according to the Boston Globe.

The time capsule, contained in a 5-by-7-inch copper box, is thought to hold a collection of coins and other artifacts dating as far back as 1652. The capsule had actually already been extracted in 1855, when the original cowhide capsule was replaced with the metal box and new items, including coins from the 1800s, were added to the stash.The box had then been mortared inside the State House cornerstone.

Meghan Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Administration and Finance, told the Globe the box may also hold an engraved silver plate, newspapers, the seal of the Commonwealth, cards and the title page of the Massachusetts Colony Records.

Time Capsule Has Steve Jobs' Computer Mouse

It’s believed to be one of the oldest time capsules ever recovered in the state — and likely would have remained in place had it not been for concerns that water had been seeping into the State House at that particular corner. That inspection prompted officials to re-excavate the time capsule to investigate its contents and make sure the items are in good condition.

“Hopefully there will be no damage and we will be able to observe the artifacts that trace us back to the history not only just of this building, but of our Commonwealth and our country,” said Secretary of State William Galvin, who was on hand for the capsule’s excavation, according to the Boston Globe.

As luck would have it, another time capsule was recovered in Boston just this past October. That 100-year-old capsule was extracted from its holding in the head of a golden lion statue that had perched atop the Old State House in downtown Boston. That capsule held sealed letters, photographs, and newspaper articles.

As for this most recently extracted time capsule, it’s now being held in a safe at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. On Sunday examiners will X-ray the box and they plan to carefully open it and inspect its contents next week. After that, it will be returned to the State House cornerstone, perhaps with a few new items added for future generations to rediscover.

1219,IS militant 'Jihadi John' named as Mohammed Emwazi from London,"A hallucinogenic fungi has been found growing in the Queen’s garden at Buckingham Palace after being discovered by gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh.

The television presenter unearthed the fungi at Buckingham Palace for an ITV gardening show called The Queen’s Garden, and said: “I won’t be eating any of that.”

Titchmarsh came across the red and white spotted toadstool — called Amanita muscaria, or fly agaric — on a tour of the private 40-acre plot with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley.

Titchmarsh, 65, asks in an ITV show to be screened on Christmas Day: “Is it edible?”

Professor Crawley replies: “That depends what you mean. It’s eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic affects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

“The old-fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness.”

Titchmarsh jokingly replies: “I think I’ll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms.”

Then he adds: “Not something to try at home.”

Later he told The Sun newspaper: “That was a surprise but it shows just how varied the species are. I won’t be eating any of that, though, no. My idea of hard drugs is Nurofen.”

On the new TV show, Titchmarsh explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools.

He says: “Every time they chop something down, they leave out the wood to rot.”

Magic mushroom is a slang term for any hallucinogenic fungus.

The most common, illegal form contains drug psilocybin, but there is no suggestion this grows in the Palace garden.

Last night a Palace spokesman told the Sun: “For the avoidance of doubt, fungi from the garden are not used in the Palace kitchens.”

The new programme will show viewers an entire year in the life of the Buckingham Palace garden, from the summer garden parties to the nocturnal wanderings of wildlife in the heart of London.

It will demonstrate how gardeners work tirelessly to maintain the Queen’s flowers, while bearing in mind her wish to see animals and insects made welcome in the gardens, swapping pesticides for homemade garlic treatments.

Titchmarsh will explore how bee hives, homes for insects and deposits from the Royal mews each help cultivate the gardens of Buckingham Palace, with top tips from gardeners giving insight into the Queen’s own tastes.

The programme, to be broadcast by ITV on Christmas Day, will also show how the garden has been used by the royal family for generations, from the king who planted mulberry trees to rival the French to the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret climbing to peer over the high garden walls.

A sandpit used by the royal children will be filmed, along with oak trees planted decades ago by the young Prince of Wales and Princess Royal, grown from acorns sown on the event of their birth.

Titchmarsh, who spent 12 months exploring how the Palace garden changed with the seasons, will be seen finishing the calendar year with a Christmas tree mounted in the Marble Hall, decorated with holly and mistletoe from the royal garden and festooned with festive golden crowns.",unrelated
1220,ISIS leader ‘killed’ in US airstrikes,"Nigeria says it has struck a cease-fire deal with Boko Haram, raising hopes that over 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped by the militant group will be released. But mystery continues to surround the identity of the interlocutor on the other side of the negotiations.

Nigerian officials said the deal was reached in Chad on Friday in talks with a Saudi Arabia-based Boko Haram representative named Danladi Ahmadu.

The name took many by surprise, including people who have been involved in previous negotiations with Boko Haram. “I have failed to find anyone who has ever heard of him,” BBC’s Nigeria correspondent wrote.   “We've tried verifying the authenticity of the person from sources traditionally close to Boko Haram militants and we are getting negative feedback,” the editors of Nigerian news site Sahara Reporters told The WorldPost by email.

Ahmad Salkida, a Nigerian journalist who is considered close to Boko Haram's leaders, said he does not believe Ahmadu is part of the group’s leadership or that he speaks for the group. “I challenge Danladi Ahmadu to an open debate if he has d [sic] interest of Nigeria at heart. Who is he?"" Salkida wrote on Twitter.

But Mike Omeri, the Nigerian government's spokesperson on the Boko Haram insurgency, told The WorldPost Saturday that the government is confident it has been negotiating with the right guy.

“These talks did not just happen one sunny morning ... They approached the president of Chad, and if he wasn’t confident [of Ahmadu’s identity] he wouldn’t have connected him with the president of Nigeria,” Omeri said. ""The fact that this contact comes from Nigeria’s neighbor gives us confidence.""

Chad has confirmed it is acting as a mediator in the talks to free the girls, who were kidnapped in the Nigerian village of Chibok in April. Since Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan visited Chad last month, rumors have grown that Nigeria's government was quietly negotiating the girls' release via its neighbor. It was not immediately clear how long the talks have been taking place.

Boko Haram's leadership has not commented on the cease-fire. Meanwhile, Ahmadu himself has purportedly made at least two statements in recent days. On Friday, he gave an interview with Voice of America’s Hausa-language service in which he didn’t mention the kidnapped schoolgirls and was vague on the details of the cease-fire, Agence France-Presse reported. The news agency also noted that Ahmadu referred to the militant group as Boko Haram, a name used by outsiders but not by the insurgents themselves.

On Saturday, Sahara Reporters said its correspondent in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri had obtained a CD recording of another statement by Ahamdu. This time, he was more precise.

“On the girls that we took from Chibok, all that we want before we free the girls is to get justice from the Nigerian state because there are many of our members that their business premises were destroyed, some killed and others in detention and many other oppression,” Ahmadu said, according to a translation from Hausa by Sahara Reporters. The news site’s editors said they remain skeptical about his identity.

As part of the deal, Omeri said, the talks taking place in Chad this week will address the release of the schoolgirls.

Omeri added that the militants are motivated by a wish to reintegrate into society. “They are working towards peace in order to have a chance for them to return to normal things -- for example, many have businesses, "" he said.

Asked whether Nigeria would consider releasing captured Boko Haram militants in exchange for the girls, Omeri said “every asset"" will be directed towards the girls' release. ""Everything possible is being done until the day they are freed,"" he said.

""Boko Haram want peace, they are ready for it and intend to have it implemented,"" he added.

After the cease-fire was announced, suspected Boko Haram militants continued to attack communities in northeast Nigeria, leaving several dozen dead over the weekend.

But Omeri insisted that the violence would not deter the negotiations. He suggested that militants in remote areas may not have heard about the cease-fire, or that the attacks could have been perpetrated by criminal opportunists, rather than Boko Haram members.

Boko Haram is ""deeply fractured,"" according to the risk consultancy Stratfor, quoted in Reuters Sunday. Nigeria's government had a ""difficult time identifying a Boko Haram representative who could make compromises and guarantee the entire group will observe them,"" Stratfor said.

""It is quite possible that Abuja has reached an agreement with a legitimate representative of a specific cell ... that holds the kidnapped schoolgirls captive,"" the group added.

In the kidnapped girls’ hometown, the community hardly dared to hope that the girls might be finally returned. ""We don't know how true it is until we prove it,"" said Bana Lawan, chairman of Chibok Local Government Area, told The Associated Press.",unrelated
1221,Iraqi media says ISIS militants have contracted Ebola,"The World Health Organisation is investigating reports that ISIS militants have been showing up at an Iraqi hospital with Ebola.

According to three media outlets an undisclosed number of militants displaying signs of the disease attended a hospital in the ISIS-held city of Mosul, 250 miles north of Baghdad.

While the reports, from Kurdish and pro-Iraqi sources, remain unconfirmed, WHO spokesman Christy Feig said the group are trying to reach out to officials in ISIS-held areas to offer help.

Infection: Several ISIS militants have arrived at a hospital in Mosul displaying signs of Ebola according to unconfirmed reports

UN workers are currently banned from entering ISIS-controlled areas in both Iraq and Syria so it is unlikely an operation in the region could be carried out.

Ms Feig told Mashable: 'We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.'

The symptoms of ebola are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever

Mosul has been under control of ISIS since June 2014 and over the past few weeks militants have reportedly executed more than a dozen doctors for refusing to treat injured fighters.

According to a report in Iraq's pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, the disease was brought to Mosul by 'terrorists' arriving 'from several countries' and Africa.

The symptoms of Ebola, which include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising, are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever meaning it could easily have have been misdiagnosed.

In addition, very few ISIS fighters are believed to have travelled up from West Africa where the Ebola outbreak originated with most coming from areas where there have been no reports of the disease.

The reports have appeared in pro-government and Kurdish media but if true it could have catastrophic implications for people in ISIS-held areas as the group is against western science and medicine.

It is not known if any of the surviving doctors in Mosul are equipped to test for Ebola or trained to treat patients and prevent the spread of the disease.

Lebanon’s Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk told domestic television channel MTV that the child’s mother is believed to have married to al-Baghdadi six years ago for a period of three months, the BBC reports.

The Iraqi government had said she was not married to the Islamist leader.

Machnouk claims al-Dulaimi is pregnant but the child is not al-Baghdadi’s.

1223,Amazon is opening its first physical store,"Unconfirmed reports are circulating on social media that the Islamic State group carried out a chemical attack while battling Kurdish forces in Kobani. Several journalists reporting from the ground on Tuesday night -- and at least one Kurdish official -- said they were aware of such reports, but that doctors lack necessary equipment to diagnose the cause of Kurdish victims' complaints. The patients said they had difficulty breathing, and many had burns on their skin, teary eyes and swollen lips. Syria (as well as Iraq) is thought to possess chemical weapons, and the U.S. and coalition forces have feared that such weapons might fall into ISIS hands.

""It could have been a silent missile or a missile placed in the neighborhood beforehand,” co-chair of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) Asya Abdullah told the Kurdish Question. “Many people have lost consciousness and are struggling to breathe and see. We are investigating the situation but do not have the necessary technical equipment or expertise.""

Journalists reporting from the border of Kobani and Turkey reportedly spoke to doctors on the scene who confirmed the PYD’s description of victims. Al Aan TV reporter Jenan Moussa posted on Twitter that a doctor said “victims who are on their way to clinic speak of following symptoms: teary eyes, suffocation and skin burns.” Victims also had “swollen lips,” Moussa added.

Kurdish affairs analyst Mutlu Civiroglu spoke to one of four remaining doctors inside Kobani, who told him all victims were civilians.

“Several patients came to health center at 11:10pm with burn in the throat & as well as complaining about headache, though their situation is NOT very severe,"" Dr. Ahmed reportedly told Civiroglu. ""We are NOT sure what the cause is yet, but we are planning to send affected patients to Suruc [neighboring city in the Turkish side of the border] in the morning for further examination.”

Reports of a similar chemical attack surfaced last week in Kobani, when several Kurdish fighters’ bodies appeared to show signs of blistering.

“Burns and white spots on the bodies of the dead indicated the use of chemicals, which led to death without any visible wounds or external bleeding,” Kurdish health minister Nisan Ahmed told Middle East Review of International Affairs journal.

There have been rumors that ISIS militants have obtained chemical weapons. Given that Kobani is on the Syrian border with Turkey, the weapons could have come from an undisclosed Syrian stockpile that used to belong to the Damascus regime.

After the Bashar Assad regime carried out a chemical attack that killed nearly a thousand people last year, it was forced to dismantle and surrender stockpiles. A year after the attack though, the U.S. State Department said that a “number of critical issues remain unresolved” about the Syrian president's chemical weapons.

The substance allegedly being used in Kobani has yet to be confirmed. However, there have been several chlorine attacks in Syria since Assad was supposed to have surrendered his weapons cache. Chlorine is not banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention but when used in large concentrations it can be weaponized. Symptoms of chlorine attacks include teary eyes, a burning sensation in the throat, the sensation of suffocation and a headache.

ISIS has been battling Kurdish fighters in Kobani for over a month, trying to consolidate territory from their de-facto headquarters in Raqqa to the Turkish border. Despite an increase in U.S-led coalition airstrikes and aid drops aimed at pushing insurgents back and helping Kurdish fighters, the battle for Kobani continued Tuesday night.",unrelated

— #BringBackOurGirls (@BBOG_Nigeria) October 17, 2014

In August, Boko Haram declared an “Islamic state” in northeastern Nigeria, the Washington Post reported. Authorities believe the group is hiding the girls somewhere in that area. Jennifer Cook, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the longer the girls stay in captivity, the harder it would be to bring them home.

“With hostage situations with this many people, to bring one set back without endangering another set is very difficult,” Cooke told Time. “In some cases, there’s a pretty good idea of where they are, but extricating them from a group of armed criminals who have so little respect for life is a difficult negotiation process. And the longer they’re there, the greater likelihood they become dispersed, and the more difficult they are to track down.”

It's unclear how the girls have been treated during their captivity, raising questions about their health. “These girls are being held under absolutely horrific circumstances, subjected to sexual violence and rape, forced into servitude,” Cooke said. “There are reports that some have become pregnant.”",discuss
1226,UPDATE: BATMAN v SUPERMAN Batmobile Reportedly Stolen By (Shocker!) Detroit Locals,"Ok, this is all still rumor, but there’s a chance a Batmobile was stolen from the set of Batman v Superman set in Detroit. My former employer Bleeding Cool posted this:
The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen.

It would not be the first time a Batmobile has been nicked in Detroit. Though that was just a $200 replica of the TV Series version back in 2o10.

So far we have no clue or confirmation, but if this is true, we should quickly form a list of suspects. My money is on King Tut.

1227,"ISIS Militants Have Contracted Ebola: Iraqi, Kurdish Media Reports","An 85-year-old woman in Waco, Texas has been been arrested for allegedly kidnapping neighbor’s cats and making them into fur coats.

Local residents couldn’t figure out where their cats were disappearing, so one or more residents decided to hire a private investigator. Some even thought they saw their own cats as a part of her fur coats. Eventually, the investigator successfully videotaped the woman stealing a neighbor’s cat.

According to World News Daily Report, the woman admitted in court that she tried to raise her own cats, but became too attached to them.

Prior to being caught on tape, the woman denied all allegations.

Prosecutors allege that the retired fashion designer skinned the cats in her basement. The following is a photo of the woman wearing one of her fur coats:

Investigators estimate that a total of 30 coats were required to make a single jacket. Additionally, they report that 20 skinned cats were found at the crime scene.

1229,Christian Bale won't play Steve Jobs,"Police will stop arresting people for low-level possession of marijuana and will instead simply issue a summons, sources said.

The NYPD and Mayor de Blasio are prepared to initiate a change in policy that would drastically reduce the number of arrests for possession of pot, according to law-enforcement sources.

The department had already been halting its pot “buy and bust” operations, a crime-fighting staple that often led to gun seizures and arrests for outstanding warrants, The Post had earlier reported.

Sources said that the “powers that be,” including City Hall, wanted to see a decrease in arrests for pot because they have “disastrous consequences’’ on police relations with minorities.

Blacks and Hispanics have accounted for 86 percent of low-level pot busts this year, according to the Marijuana Research Project.

At a press conference scheduled for Monday, de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton are expected to announce the key aspects of the policy change.

They will also likely spell out such details as how much marijuana will be considered low-level.

De Blasio plans to meet with the city’s five district attorneys this week, according to The New York Times, and Brooklyn DA Kenneth Thompson has already expressed disapproval at policy change.

Thompson has curbed prosecution of low-level possession of marijuana in his borough, and his office has already dismissed many misdemeanor marijuana cases.

1230,"Islamic Tribunal Using Sharia Law In Texas Has Been Confirmed Tribunal members say they will avoid Sharia's ""criminal law.""","The internet is buzzing this morning with news that country icon and legend Willie Nelson has died. One big problem is that the buzz is kind of pointless since the country crooner isn’t dead at all. Sure, he may be 81-years-old, but he’s still alive and truckin’ and touring, so Willie Nelson isn’t dead — he’s simply the victim of another celebrity death hoax.

The website MSMBC posted the article that Willie Nelson was “found dead today in his Maui home.” It goes on to give details to state that rumors of his death first circulated early on February 21 by social media outlets, and that the police later confirmed the news.

With the article was even a picture showing his face looking all solemn and the dates of his life.

The article states that a groundskeeper was doing some routine maintenance on Nelson’s property and found him dead on the front lawn. He called 911, and the police came out to the scene to reportedly find Nelson dead. There even quotes from the “police.”

“There was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play,” said Det. Aldeson.

Here’s the issue with all of this. Many people will see the site and think it is MSNBC when it’s really just MSMBC. The latter is not a real news site by any stretch of the imagination.

There are other fake story links on the side of the article, but they all lead back to the article about Willie Nelson’s so-called death. At the bottom of the page are links to their “About,” “Terms of Use,” and “Privacy,” but they all lead nowhere.

Even with more quotes from the police in the article, don’t believe that Willie Nelson is dead, because he isn’t.

“Determining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,” said County Coroner Frank Shultz. “It’s just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.”

The article is sadly making the rounds on Facebook, Twitter, and other forms of social media without having any real merit. It states that the “story is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified.”

Of course, it is and it hasn’t. That’s because it isn’t even remotely true.

The Missoulian just reported a day ago that Willie Nelson is going to play Ogren Park in the middle of June with Alison Kraus. Sure, anything is possible to happen, but the death of Willie Nelson right now isn’t one of them.

Willie Nelson is not dead. He is the victim of the newest celebrity death hoax going around, one that people are going to believe because it’s being shared by a ton of people.

1232,Officials shoot down congressman's claims ISIS terrorists are running across US-Mexico border,"LAS VEGAS -- The person behind the $300,000 dinner at Bellagio’s Prime Steakhouse has been revealed.

Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Vice Media Inc. CEO Shane Smith sprung for the dinner following a lucky run at the casino’s blackjack tables. Bloomberg said its source was a person who asked not to be identified because the meal was private.

On Tuesday, MGM Resorts International Chairman Jim Murren cited the dinner bill as an “encouraging sign” that Las Vegas visitors were eager to spend money again. He said the dinner was for a party of more than a dozen people at the upscale Prime and included wine with a price tag upward of $15,000 per bottle.

A guest at the dinner, who asked not to be identified, told Bloomberg the dinner party was closer to 25.

Murren said he hadn’t seen a check like that since 2007.

Bloomberg termed Brooklyn-based Vice a media titan that “has grown from a free, whiskey-stained Montreal monthly.” Technology Crossover Ventures and A+E Networks each invested $250 million for 10 percent stakes in the company last year.

Smith is 45 and, according to Gawker, gave $1 million to Vice’s staff at last year’s holiday party.

1234,Blundering boyfriend burns down college after trying to impress his girlfriend with elaborate marriage proposal,"In an effort to console a grieving boy after the death of his beloved pup, Pope Francis declared that ‘all of God’s creatures’ have a shot of ending up in heaven when they die. New York dog owners and animal lovers everywhere rejoiced at the good news.

Delighted city dog owners agreed Friday with Pope Francis’ comforting comment to a distraught boy that the lad’s recently departed canine would be welcome in the hereafter.

“That’s great!” said fashion designer Allina Liu as her pet pooch, Snoopy, hit the Union Square dog run. “All dogs go to heaven, right? There is no hell for dogs.

“There is hell for people who treat their dogs badly. People who treat their animals poorly just shouldn’t have them.”

The Pope, speaking earlier this week, offered his assurance of four-legged angels to the grieving child.

""Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures,"" he said during the weekly papal address.

“This marvelous plan cannot but involve everything that surrounds us and came from the heart and mind of God,” the pontiff said.

The Pope’s stance was also hailed by animal-rights activists. Though his dog dogma appeared unexpected, there had been earlier clues to the Pope’s feelings about the animal kingdom. He took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.

Francis’ puppy views reverse opinions from previous popes, who maintained that heaven was just for human believers.

In a 2008 sermon, Pope Benedict XVI explained that not all creatures “are called to eternity” and when non-humans die, their deaths mean “solely the end of existence on earth.” The move seemingly barred pets from paradise.

Francis did not say if dogs could go to hell, too.

The puppy pardon is the latest move in his apparent campaign to make the Catholic church more inclusive and tolerant.

Earlier this year, he said gay men and women had “gifts” to offer the church, a dramatic shift in tone from the Vatican’s traditional anti-gay views. He also softened the church’s condemnation of premarital sex, cohabitation and divorce.

Health care worker Sarah Gluck, 26, said she was not religious, but definitely approved the Pope’s words.

“Dogs are a reflection of their owners; 99% of dogs go to heaven. But there’s always that 1%.”

Gluck said it’s too soon to know if her 4-month-old Australian shepherd will find eternal salvation.

“It’s hard to tell right now if Lilly is going to heaven because she’s so young,” said Gluck. “But if she goes to hell, it’ll be my fault.”

Dog walker Donna Bruno, 32, brought beagle-bulldog Hailey and Wheaten terrier Emma to the park with her.

She didn’t see how things could get any better for her canine charges.

“All dogs go to heaven?” Bruno asked as she watched the pair carouse happily with their equally excited pals.

“They’re already in heaven. Look at these guys,” she said.

CBI Files Case Against 'MSG: The Messenger of God' Actor,"TEXAS CITY — A local plumber is being flooded with phone calls — and some threats — after a picture of one of his old company vehicles being used by Islamist militants in Syria was posted on Twitter.
The picture was posted online by the Islamic extremist brigade Ansar al-Deen Front, according to a CBS News report. It shows a black pick-up truck with a Mark-1 Plumbing decal on the door and an anti-aircraft gun in the bed.
Mark Oberholtzer, who has owned and operated Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City for the past 32 years, confirmed it was his pickup truck in the picture. He said he no longer owned the vehicle and had no idea how it ended up in Syria.
Oberholtzer said he traded in the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago. He usually takes the decals off his vehicles when he sells them but he left it on this truck with the expectation that AutoNation would remove it.
“They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it,” Oberholtzer said. “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.”
He began receiving calls about the truck and the picture on Monday afternoon, Oberholtzer said. By Tuesday he said his business had received a thousand calls and faxes about the image.
“A few of the people are really ugly,” he said.
Derek Duckett, emergency management coordinator for Texas City, said he was unaware of any threats but was checking with local police to reach out to Mark 1 to see whether it needed assistance.
Oberholtzer said he didn’t know what to do about all the attention he was getting from the picture. He just wanted the public to know that the vehicle was no longer his.

According to a report on Sunday from The New York Times, the New York Police Department (NYPD) is planning to announce new guidelines that would allow those found in possession of small amounts of marijuana to walk away with a ticket instead of spending time in handcuffs.

The change in policy could have wide-ranging effects in a city known for arresting thousands citizens each year for marijuana possession.

If true, the change in policy could also have a significant impact on the city's black and Hispanic community, which some studies say are disproportionately affected by the police department's current marijuana arrest policy.

The upcoming shift in enforcement, which the report says is something of a throwback to the city's policy in the late '70s, comes just days after Alaska, Oregon and Washington D.C. voted to legalize cannabis, joining Colorado and Washington, events that may point toward a national trend.

1240,North Korea denies reports Kim Jong-un is to open state-backed restaurant in Scotland,"NEW YORK — Pope Francis has given hope to gays, unmarried couples and advocates of the Big Bang theory. Now, he has endeared himself to dog lovers, animal-rights activists and vegans.

Trying to console a little boy whose dog had died, Pope Francis told him in a recent public appearance on St Peter’s Square that “paradise is open to all of God’s creatures”. While it is unclear whether the Pope’s remarks helped soothe the child, they were welcomed by groups such as the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

In his relatively short tenure as leader of the world’s one billion Roman Catholics since taking over from Benedict XVI, Pope Francis, 77, has repeatedly caused a stir among conservatives in the church.

He has suggested more lenient positions than his predecessor on issues such as homosexuality, single motherhood and unwed couples.

Theologians cautioned that Pope Francis had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.

Reverend James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor-at-large of America, a Catholic magazine, said he believed that Pope Francis was at least asserting that “God loves and Christ redeems all of creation”, even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals. “He said paradise is open to all creatures,” Rev Martin said.

The question of whether animals go to heaven has been debated for much of the church’s history. Pope Benedict said during a 2008 sermon that when an animal dies, it “just means the end of existence on earth”.

Ms Christine Gutleben, senior director of the Humane Society, said Pope Francis’ apparent reversal of his predecessor’s view could be enormous. “If the Pope did mean that all animals go to heaven, then the implication is that animals have a soul. And if that is true, then we ought to seriously consider how we treat them because they mean something to God,” she said.

Ms Sarah Withrow King, director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA, one of the most activist anti-slaughterhouse groups, said the Pope’s remarks could move Catholics away from consuming meat. But there are differing views.

Mr Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, said in an email that it “certainly does not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin”. THE NEW YORK TIMES",unrelated
1241,"These LEGO Instructions from 1974 Are Awesome (And Yes, They're Real)","Industry sources indicate Apple is planning to lean heavily on Samsung as a component supplier for both new iPhone 6 builds and the upcoming Apple Watch, reports BusinessKorea (via G for Games). If true, this would be a marked change from Apple's reported goal of lessening its reliance on Samsung by seeking alternative suppliers for critical hardware components.

According to the report, Apple is looking to Samsung to supply RAM, NAND flash storage, and batteries for future iPhone 6 production, supplementing or replacing current suppliers for those components.

NAND flash has been a particular area of concern for Apple according to recent news reports, with the company's decision to use cheaper and slower TLC (triple-level cell) flash memory for larger-capacity iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models being blamed for sporadic crashing issues. Apple has reportedly moved to stop the use of its current TLC NAND flash chips and supposedly is back at the negotiating table with the South Korean supplier.At first, Apple discussed with Samsung about the supply of NAND flash for the iPhone 6. Due to problems with prices, Toshiba's TLC NAND flash was used in the 128GB models, and components made by SK Hynix, Toshiba, and SanDisk were used in the 64GB models.

However, as overseas IT news sites reported functional defects in the 128GB models, Apple is said to be considering whether or not to replace the TLC NAND flash made by Toshiba with Samsung's own TLC NAND flash. If Apple and Samsung strike a deal, Samsung will supply both DRAM and NAND flash to the iPhone 6.Beyond the iPhone 6, the same Korean industry sources also claim Samsung will supply Apple with application processors for the Apple Watch, which is slated to debut in early 2015.

Apple touts the Apple Watch as using a new ""S1"" module for the internals that seals nearly all of the internal components into a single resin-filled package for durability. The individual components of the S1 are undoubtedly being provided by several different manufacturers, but according to today's report the main application processor portion will be coming from Samsung.

He told a news conference in the state capital, Chilpancingo: 'We still can't talk about an exact number of bodies. We are still working at the site.'

Reports from the scene in the community of Pueblo Viejo said at least 15 bodies were exhumed from the site.

Iguala is about 120 miles (193 km) south of Mexico City in the increasingly violent state of Guerrero, the site of clashes involving students, police and armed men last week. At least six people were killed in a spate of incidents.

Guerrero Governor Angel Aguirre said earlier this week that photos showed police had taken some of the students away.

Several hundred students protested on Saturday night in front of Aguirre's residence in the state capital of Chilpancingo, expressing anger that some of their classmates may be among the bodies found in the graves.

A car was overturned and several petrol bombs were hurled at the residence perimeter, where security outposts were lightly damaged.

Authorities found the mass grave as police are scouring the area for nearly four dozen people missing after a rash of violence. Guerrero was the site of clashes involving students, police and armed men, which started in late September

The graves were found up a steep hill after some of the 30 suspects detained in the case told authorities about their location

If the students are in those pits, it would be one of the worst slaughters that Mexico has witnessed since the drug war intensified in 2006, leaving 80,000 people dead to date

Four forensic services vans left for the morgue late on Thursday carrying bodies in silver bags

A police official said on Saturday that there was video footage of eight to 10 students being put into police trucks earlier in the week.

Twenty-two police officers were arrested in Guerrero on Sunday, accused of killing two students during the clashes last week.

Aguirre said on Saturday that a total of 30 individuals have now been detained in connection with the incidents.

Local government officials criticized the police for showing an excessive use of force with the students in Guerrero, where gangs have evolved from a fragmented drug cartel and are fighting turf wars.

Thirteen of an original group of 57 missing people re-emerged this week. Some had hidden, others had gone home. Dozens are still unaccounted for.

Many mass graves have been found across Mexico in recent years and months, the legacy of drug gang violence that has killed around 100,000 people since 2007.

Thousands of students and teachers blocked the highway between Chilpancingo and Acapulco for hours on Thursday, demanding help from federal authorities to find the missing

""Many of you have wondered why I was so freaked out about my relationship with Michael Phelps being exposed,"" the 41-year-old D.C.-area woman begins her post. ""Here is the truth.""

I was born intersex and named David Roy Fitch at birth. By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one.

My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery.

Yes, I was with Michael the night of the DUI, the story of the Uber and crying and me wanting to stay with him that night are true. A lot of the other things printed are lies. I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn't put him or our relationship in the best light. He is the first man I ever had intimacy with and felt comfortable and all woman.

Chandler says she only told Phelps about her past once the ""threat of the media exposing me forced me too.""

Mr Abdulla returned to the UK last week but told The Sun how an elderly Kurdish woman, whose son was captured by ISIS and taken to Mosul, went to meet the jihadis to try and secure his release and was then fed his body.

The father of four told the newspaper: 'She was determined to find her son and went to ISIS headquarters and asked to see him.

'The ISIS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

'They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were kind.

'But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said ""You've just eaten him.""'

During his time on the front line, Mr Abdulla revealed how ISIS are terrorising locals by calling them and threatening to kidnap them and bury them alive unless they surrender.

He also told of how the terror group kill prisoners they capture by throwing them on a 'human bonfire' and that he saw his own cousin killed in an ISIS attack.

But despite returning back to his family in Yorkshire, Mr Abdulla is keen to go back to Kurdistan saying he wants to finish the job in defeating ISIS.

The new details about the cruelty of ISIS come as Iraq's prime minister called on tribal fighters to abandon the jihadis ahead of an offensive to retake Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from extremists.

Haider al-Abadi offered no timeline for an attack on Tikrit, 80 miles north of Baghdad, which fell into the hands of ISIS last summer.

ISIS and Al Qaeda are hiding messages to their followers in digitally-altered eBay photos and even pornography, a book claims.

Investigative journalist Gordon Thomas said Al Qaeda has used the tactic of 'steganography' - concealing messages in audio clips or images widely available online - to encode items listed for sale on the auction site.

It works by manipulating a sound waveform or the order of pixels in a small or invisible part of an image, a process not unlike the way teletext used to be delivered on analogue TVs.

Now Israeli intelligence service Mossad believes ISIS militants are doing the same, according to Mr Thomas.

One intelligence source told him messages are often hidden on Reddit or 'X-rated pornographic pictures which conceal documents and orders for the next target'.

The claims are contained within new chapters of Mr Thomas' book Gideon's Spies, an extract of which was published yesterday by the New York Post.

However, Shiite militias and Iraqi security forces have stationed themselves around Tikrit as state-run media has warned that the city 'will soon return to its people.'

Tikrit, which occasionally saw attacks on U.S. forces during the American occupation of the country, is one of the biggest cities held by ISIS.

It also sits on the road to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, which is also held by the extremists.

It has also been revealed that in February alone, violence across Iraq killed at least 1,100 Iraqis, including more than 600 civilians, according to the the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq.

UN envoy Nickolay Mladenov blamed the deaths on the extremist group, government forces and pro-government Shiite militias.

He explained: 'Daily terrorist attacks perpetrated by ISIS continue to deliberately target all Iraqis.

'There also concerning reports of a number of revenge killings by armed groups in areas recently liberated from ISIS.'

Last year was the deadliest in Iraq since its 2006-2007 sectarian bloodshed, with a total of 12,282 people killed and 23,126 wounded, according to the UN.

1245,Was Heart-Tugging Viral Video Of Generous Homeless Man All A Hoax?,"U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter this week declared terrorists have been crossing the Rio Grande.

The California Republican, speaking to Greta Van Susteren on Fox News Oct. 7, 2014, said he’d learned from the U.S. Border Patrol that Islamic State fighters had been nabbed trying to enter the country from Mexico. ""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" Hunter said, adding a moment later: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""

Border Patrol agents ""caught them,"" Hunter also said, but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""

Our eyebrows were raised. We sought detail.

No federal or state confirmation

No state or federal law enforcement agency confirmed Hunter’s account when we inquired, and Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper declined to reveal the congressman’s sources.

Fox News, in its original Oct. 8, 2014, online news report on Hunter’s declaration, quoted the Department of Homeland Security disputing his account.

Homeland Security told PolitiFact Texas that no such apprehensions have occurred. An agency spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, emailed: ""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

And after Hunter spoke, the Texas Department of Public Safety wrote state legislators, saying in an Oct. 8, 2014, email it ""does not have any information to confirm"" statements about Islamic terrorists or ISIS fighters entering the country. A DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, confirmed the message’s authenticity.

In the message, a DPS deputy director, Robert Bodisch, mentioned the Hunter interview and an Oct. 8, 2014, news report by Judicial Watch, a conservative news website, stating Islamic terrorists had entered the country from Mexico. According to unidentified Homeland Security sources, Judicial Watch said four terrorists had been apprehended in the previous 36 hours by federal authorities and the DPS in McAllen and Pharr.

In the message to legislators, Bodisch further wrote: ""An unsecure border is certainly a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminals of all kinds, and it would be naïve to rule out the possibility that any criminal organization would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our international border. That said, DPS does not have any information to confirm the specific statements recently reported in the press.""

On Sept. 17, 2014, PolitiFact in Washington analyzed an August 2014 Judicial Watch story, finding Mostly False another congressman’s claim that ""we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez,"" which neighbors El Paso. Research did not turn up any law enforcement official or news outlet that independently verified or corroborated the claim, making the declaration that ""we know"" with certainty ISIS is in Juarez a big stretch.

For this fact check, a terrorism expert said Hunter’s claim doesn’t make much sense.

""It’s implausible given the way the criminal-justice system works to have 10 ISIS fighters arrested at the border and never charged,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, director of the Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington.

Gartenstein-Ross said by phone he knows of ""no reporting coming through DHS suggesting that a large number of ISIS fighters have been intercepted at the border. I’ve talked to a large number of people within the department, and the department has unequivocally denied it. There’s not one shred of evidence this is the case.""

Kasper, informed we'd not confirmed Hunter's statement, said Hunter stands by what he said.

Kasper also expressed doubt federal agencies are revealing the facts about fighters getting caught.

""Problem here is that this is always a zero-sum game,"" Kasper wrote. ""We make the point. Official channels deny. Then, maybe in a few years from now the information will pop up on the front page of the Washington Post,""  much like that newspaper this week reported new details about the Secret Service prostitution scandal, Kasper said.

Our ruling

Hunter said ""at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas"" and there are ""dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""

No government agency confirms anything remotely close to the idea that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border. Notably, too, the lead Texas agency entrusted with public safety alerted legislators of its own lack of confirmation. Similarly, the idea there are ""dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol"" is missing a factual basis.

All told, this statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

1246,Tourist wakes to find strange red trail on his stomach - and discovers a spider has burrowed through his appendix scar and crawled UNDER his skin while on holiday in Bali,"While the US Vogue offices are moving to 1 World Trade Center in New York City, Anna Wintour may not be making the transition anytime soon.

A Vogue employee told Gawker that the new offices are infested with rats. And the problem is apparently so bad that the editor-in-chief is reportedly refusing to enter the premises.

Wintour, 65, has allegedly informed her staffers that the vermin must be removed before she clicks her dainty heels into their new home.

New digs, big problem: While the US Vogue offices are moving to 1 World Trade Center in New York City, Anna Wintour may not be making the transition anytime soon

Vogue, however, is not scheduled to move into the 1 World Trader Center until the new year, giving ample time for the removal of the rodents.

The staff member told Gawker the most pressing dilemma facing them had to do with fashion: 'A serious concern (laughable but I guess it makes sense) is all the clothing that could get nibbled through.'

The timing of the infestation comes after Vogue created an online campaign advertising their move to the new offices: 'Batten the hatches, lower Manhattan, because we're coming for you.'

That's one famous mover: The Instagram feed for the Conde Nast owned publication showed rapper Will.i.am carrying boxes for them

The Instagram feed for the Conde Nast owned publication showed rapper Will.i.am carrying boxes for them.

Meanwhile, Wintour has defended her decision to put Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on the April cover of Vogue, but now it appears she is suggesting that the choice was 'tasteless'.

According to Fashionista, the magazine editor said: 'I think if we just remain deeply tasteful and just put deeply tasteful people on the cover, it would be a rather boring magazine!'

Day in the life: The publication was tongue in cheek about the moving process

She added that even from the very beginning, Vogue was never about pleasing everyone. 'The first celebrity that I put on the cover of Vogue was Madonna, and that was considered completely controversial at the time, too,' she explained.

'It's such a long time ago probably no one remembers, but she was a very controversial figure. Now she's part of the establishment.'

Ms Wintour, 65, went on to say that if Vogue didn't reflect modern culture - even the more provocative figures within it - 'nobody would talk about us. It's very important that people do talk about us.'",unrelated
1247,ISIS Fighters Getting Caught Coming Across the U.S.-Mexican Border?,"Apple would never lower itself to rubbing elbows with the unwashed masses at CES, but it does like to throw out a few announcements during the show to get under everyone’s skin. Cupertino has been quiet thus far, but rumors are swirling about a 12-inch MacBook Air refresh, and this isn’t just a spec bump. Apple is reportedly redesigning the iconic laptop to be even thinner with a higher resolution screen.
Sources inside the company who have used the prototype notebook (code named MacBook Stealth) say it will eschew many of the conventional laptop features in the name of advancing design. The current MacBook Air’s taper toward the front edge, which gives them a very slim profile, but there’s still space near the back for the power connector and full-sized USBs. The new Air, however, won’t be thick enough for a USB port. Instead, Apple will start using the new type-c reversible connectors. There also won’t be an SD card slot or a MagSafe power connector–even Apple’s beloved Thunderbolt is taking a hike. USB will do it all.

The 12-inch laptop would be substantially smaller and lighter than the 13-inch model, and even slightly smaller than the 11-inch version. This is thanks to slimmer bezels and a slightly more compact keyboard with less separate between keys. 9to5Mac doesn’t have details on exactly how high the resolution will be, but the current Airs are sitting at 1366 x 768 (11-inch) and 1440 x 900 (13-inch). Stepping it up to a Retina Display resolution of 2560 x 1600 (like the 13-inch Pro) would be amazing in the Air’s form factor.
profilel-r-copy
To be clear, all the images of this supposed notebook are renders created by 9to5Mac. This is still thoroughly in the rumor category, but it’s a redesign we’ve been expecting for a long time. The updated MacBook Air could be announced in mid-2015.

1248,Mass grave found after 40 students disappear in Mexican protest,"Authorities unearthed on Saturday unmarked graves containing a number of bodies on the outskirts of a southern Mexico town where 43 students disappeared after a deadly police shooting last week.

Inaky Blanco, chief prosecutor for the violence-plagued state of Guerrero, told reporters ""pits with bone remains"" had been found outside Iguala, 125 miles south of Mexico City.

""It's hard to be sure that it's the missing students because we must conduct expert tests and find similarities with the people being searched,"" a state police agent at the scene told AFP on condition of anonymity.

The graves were in rough terrain in a hillside community that is part of the Iguala municipality. Police kept reporters far from the site.

The 43 students disappeared last weekend after Iguala municipal officers shot at buses that the group had seized to return to their teacher training college near the state capital Chilpancingo.

Three students were killed. Another three people died when police and suspected gang members shot at another bus carrying football players on the outskirts of town.

Witnesses told AFP that the officers took away several students in patrol cars after the shooting. One witness said he saw 30 to 40 people taken away.

The officers are suspected of having links to criminal gangs, raising fears about the students' fate in a country where drug cartels often bury their victims in mass graves.

Around 30 bodies were found in mass graves in Iguala alone this year.

Another police official said the pits on the outskirts of Iguala were found thanks to an anonymous phone tip.

""We are very worried. The families are very anxious,"" said Vidulfo Rosales, a human rights lawyer representing relatives of the missing.

Authorities have detained 22 Iguala officers over the shootings and issued arrest warrants for the town's mayor and security chief, both of whom have disappeared.

The United Nations has urged Mexican authorities to conduct an ""effective and diligent"" search for the missing, calling the case ""one of the most terrible events of recent times.""

Dozens of police officers, soldiers and investigators were deployed to the area after the graves were found.

Guerrero is one of the most violent states in Mexico, with gangs known as ""Guerreros Unidos"" and ""Los Rojos"" engaged in bloody turf wars.",discuss
1249,Missing Mexican students 'not found in mass grave',"Correction appended

A video shared online made it seem as if Vladimir Putin got some unwelcome love from a feathered friend Sunday during a speech unveiling a monument to Russians who served in World War I.

Putin was speaking about the sacrifice made by Russian soldiers in World War I, linking the Great War to his own current political troubles. “This tragedy reminds us what happens when aggression, selfishness and the unbridled ambitions of national leaders and political establishments push common sense aside, so that instead of preserving the world’s most prosperous continent, Europe, they lead it towards danger,” he said. “It is worth remembering this today.”
