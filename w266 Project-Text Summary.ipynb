      "Local residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky. A small meteorite crashed into a wooded area in Nicaragua's capital of Managua overnight, the government said Sunday. Residents reported hearing a mysterious boom that left a 16-foot deep crater near the city's airport, the Associated Press reports. Murillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried. Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was \"very strange that no one reported a streak of light. \"We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,\" he said. House-sized asteroid 2014 RC, which measured 60 feet in diameter, skimmed the Earth this weekend, ABC News reports. The site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. \"I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast.\n",

      "While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said child soldiers with ISIS are as young 12 and 13 years old. Children are also frequently used in ISIS propaganda, with photos showing children in “uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media,” the UN reported. The photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors ISIS social media for the London-based Quilliam counter-extremism think tank. “It seems like a very legitimate thing,” Mr. Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that ISIS is known to use child soldiers. “Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by ISIS,” said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative. Posting photos of a gun-toting child online, ISIS supporters announced that the group’s youngest soldier has died in combat. Twitter accounts linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham claimed that the child soldier “got martyred” with his father while fighting for the terrorist group in Syria. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. air strike, though that has not been confirmed. #IS http://t.co/N1PUeXI7iR — Islamic State Times (@ISTimes1) October 07, 2014 Mr. Cooper first saw ISIS supporters tweeting that the young boy was dead on Sept. 26.

It also helps that remote traces of coca have been found, at some point in time, in various popular beverages, including Red Bull.

Its Asteroid Initiative includes a plan to capture an asteroid and tug it into orbit around the moon in the 2020s. It exploded on the same day that Asteroid 2012 DA14, one that was being carefully tracked by NASA, safely passed by Earth. On February 15, 2013, a nearly 60-foot-wide meteor plunged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk with the force of about 30 nuclear bombs. NASA is trying to speed up the way it tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and to learn how to deflect rocks that threaten Earth. NASA hasn't confirmed a link between the meteorite and the asteroid. The Today Nicaragua site reported the crater was found after a loud blast about 11:05 p.m. on Saturday. The Nicaragua Dispatch said the hole is in the woods near Managua's Sandino International Airport and about 1,000 feet (300 meters) from the Camino Real Hotel. If it works, astronauts will land on the asteroid, take samples and bring them back to Earth. It was estimated to be 60 feet (18 meters) long.\n",

Word has it that Amazon is looking to launch an ad-supported streaming video service, which could give rivals a run for their money. The Wall Street Journal in March reported that Amazon was planning to launch its own advertising-filled TV streaming service — free to users, of course. The online retail giant is planning to roll out the new service early next year, the New York Post reported on Friday. It would be separate from Amazon's $99 yearly Prime membership, which offers unlimited movie streaming from the Instant Video library. Amazon had only 2.6 percent of downstream traffic, but its share has more than doubled in the past 18 months, Sandvine said. Meanwhile, Amazon is already gaining ground on streaming rivals. Netflix accounted for 34.9 percent of downstream North American traffic in the peak evening hours this year.\n",

On Tuesday, U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed Islamic State fighting positions, a building and a large Islamic State unit. Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S.-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria. A video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State showed a cache of weapons including hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. U.S. officials said Tuesday they could not confirm the video's authenticity but are looking into the claims. On Tuesday, though, Islamic State loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said \"Team USA.\" Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

      "$15/MONTH WOULD MAKE HBO'S SERVICE NEARLY TWICE THE COST OF NETFLIX Apple is reportedly one of the partners that HBO could launch its new service with. HBO may want to position this service as something distinctly different from its cable service as a way to prevent subscribers from moving online. HBO's subscription streaming service will be called HBO Now and is expected to cost $15 per month, according to the International Business Times. Nonetheless, it seems likely that HBO would want to work with multiple major partners to get this service out there. It's still not known what HBO's subscription streaming service will actually offer. That price would make it tougher to compete with Netflix, but HBO hasn't exactly had trouble finding people willing to pay subscription fees that high in the past. With the even wider audience that this service will open it up to, HBO may not be that worried. On the other hand, the $15 per month fee may mean that HBO is earning about as much regardless of how you subscribe. If a deal is made, Apple TV users would be able to access and stream HBO Now, potentially through a standalone app. According to the Times, Apple has been aggressive in its attempts to secure a place as one of HBO's launch partners.\n",

That pink gold Apple Watch is looking like a pretty good Valentine’s Day present right now, isn’t it? According to a French website, the Apple Watch will start at around $500 for the steel model. Gold will be even more expensive. A new report, however, provides some possible answers to these questions. iGen.fr also suggests that the Apple Watch will rank low on the iFixIt repairability scale.\n",

Shortly after arriving home, Mr. Phillips began exhibiting flu-like symptoms, but did not immediately go to the hospital. The small town of Purdon, Texas has been quarantined after a family of five tested positive for the Ebola virus.

Al-Thinni had said after his resignation that his government had lost control of almost all state institutions and government offices to the armed Islamist militias.

The scorpion-filled weapons have even been credited by some with ending the 20 day siege on the desert city. There are 25 known species of scorpion with venom capable of killing a human being. Mr Bretton-Gordon, who returned from Baghdad last week where he had been advising security forces, added: \"The main thing is creating fear.\"\n",

      "The dedicated pet owner initially refused to pay for the procedure to save the 3-inch fish at Toll Barn Veterinary Center in Norfolk, but quickly changed his mind. But the man, who has not been named, had a change of heart and returned just 10 minutes later to give them the green light. The dedicated owner took his blocked-up 3-inch pet to a vet after realizing it was struggling to pass waste, reports the Norfolk Daily Eastern Press. A British man forked out $460 to save the life of his goldfish — after it became constipated. He was stunned to be told that the delicate operation needed to solve the problem would cost $460. Vet Faye Bethell administered anesthetic to the fish, which was believed to be 2-years and 10-months old. After 50-minutes, the fish was handed back to his grateful owner. Shocked at the high cost, he initially refused to give Toll Barn Veterinary Center in Norfolk the go-ahead. The 29-year-old then used a tiny scalpel to remove a lump which had grown close to its dorsal fin. People love their pets — but that was an expensive little goldfish,\" she added.\n",

The former Comcast customer, identified only as \"Conal,\" told his story to Consumerist, the site whose readers have named Comcast \"the worst company in America\" two years running. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal's subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he'd only received positive feedback and reviews for his work. Comcast's counsel says the ex-customer \"is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn\" about his customer service struggle. So he tried the Controller's office again, to let them know that the rep they'd sent his way had failed miserably at her job. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues. Customer service reps promised the problems would be resolved. He describes that callback as \"bizarre,\" with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with \"How can I help you?\" According to Conal, Comcast sent him nearly $2,000 of equipment he'd never ordered and didn't want, and tried to bill him for it anyway.

To his horror, scans revealed his entire body had been infected with tapeworm after eating too much sashimi - raw slices of fish. Tapeworm infections occur after ingesting the larvae of diphyllobothrium, found in freshwater fish such as salmon, although marinated and smoked fish can also transmit the worm. 8 People’s Hospital, told the website that'smags.com that eating uncooked food contaminated with tapeworms' eggs could eventually cause cysticercosis, when the adult worms enters a person’s blood stream. Study author Nancy Craig wrote: 'The widespread popularity of Japanese sushi and sashimi (slices of raw fish) is a contributor. Research has shown that eating raw or undercooked fish can lead to a variety of parasitic infections. Doctors believe some of the uncooked Japanese delicacy of raw meat or fish must have become contaminated. Because sushi is not cooked, the larvae can in turn transfer into the flesh of any human that eats the fish. But one man's love of sashimi nearly killed him after it led to his body becoming riddled with tapeworm. If larvae begin to migrate to other parts of the body they can start to eat away at the liver, eyes, heart or brain and cause life-threatening conditions.\n",

      "Check out my counterpoint, “The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch Edition“ Gold is Expensive Let’s start with a little backgrounder in gold. Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as “standard gold”. One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but it’s much, much smaller than the Apple watch and it’s circular to boot! 18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law. Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch.\n",

But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,” he told Inserbia.info. “It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education, so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences. Nenad Babici, the national coordinator for reproductive health of the republic, told Inserbia.info that it was discovered that the seven schoolgirls got pregnant on the school trip. Educational institutes and parents, he said, should play a stronger role in providing effective sex education. However, Babici blamed parents for not educating their children properly. He said that early sexual relations later lead to adverse consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births. The schoolgirls, from the city of Banja Luka, went to the Bosnia and Herzegovina capital, Sarajevo. Furious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision, reported the Daily Mail. Senad Mehmedbasic, a Sarajevo gynecologist, said a growing trend of underage pregnancies in Bosnia and Herzegovina is worrying.\n"

This, she said, \"is how I will chose to remember James -- as a brave and tireless journalist with a passion for the Syrian cause.\" His time as a teacher For Foley, these were acts of service, not entirely unlike his time spent in the Teach for America program. Foley freelanced for a number of news media outlets, including GlobalPost, a world news Web site founded in 2009. For Foley's family and friends, the recording was the answer they hoped they'd never hear to their questions about his disappearance. One of his friends, Alex Sherman of Bloomberg News, wrote on Twitter that he was a \"funny, warm, Big Lebowski-loving guy.\" \"Jim was a great journalist, and I think he'd like to be remembered that way, first and foremost.\" BuzzFeed Middle East correspondent Sheera Frenkel said she last saw Foley about a week before his final trip into Syria. Foley -- Jim to his friends -- had been reporting from war-torn countries for the better part of four years when he disappeared in Syria.\n",

The exiled Tibetan leader requested the meeting during a visit to Rome but it was declined 'for obvious reasons concerning the delicate situation' with China. Francis was quoted by Italian news media as saying: 'One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. The issue of whether animals have the chance of an afterlife has been debated for centuries. The Catholic Church in China is divided in two; the official Church overseen by the Chinese Communist Party, and an underground community that swears allegiance to the Pope. A Vatican official said the Pope's decision was 'not taken out of fear but to avoid any suffering by those who have already suffered'.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to ISIS, the agency said. Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people on Tuesday.

      "WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. airstrikes earlier this week killed the leader of the al-Shabab terrorist group in Somalia, the Pentagon said Friday. President Barack Obama said the death of Ahmed Abdi Godane demonstrated U.S. counterterrorism resolve and was an example of his deliberate approach to dismantling al-Qaida affiliated groups. Obama faces mounting pressure to take more aggressive military action against the Islamic State, which evolved from an al-Qaida affiliate that sprouted in Iraq in 2004. \"We have been very systematic and methodical in going after these kinds of organizations\" that threaten U.S. personnel and the homeland, Obama said. \"The individual who takes his place will live in fear,\" said Army Col. Steven Warren, a Pentagon spokesman. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud urged al-Shabab militants to renounce violence, saying they have an opportunity to embrace peace following Godane's death. It took the Pentagon four days to conclusively determine that Godane had not survived Monday's airstrikes. The Pentagon's press secretary, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, announced the death in a brief written statement. Al-Shabab has not publicly confirmed Godane's death. Berger predicted a significant splintering between al-Shabab's domestically focused insurgents and internationally aspiring terrorists.\n",

      "Although standard among smartwatches, the issue has created controversy, since many had been hoping Apple would solve the smartwatch industry's battery woes with its inaugural effort. With the exception of Pebble products, most current and upcoming smartwatches - including the Apple Watch - will last no more than a day on a single charge. It's said to cut power to all non-essential functions and display only the time, helping to extend the watch's life in cases where a recharge may not be possible. Apple previously stated that the Watch's battery should last only a normal day, requiring a fresh charge at night. The function is similar in concept to the Battery Saver mode in Android 5.0, which can push smartphone battery life from minutes to hours by reducing processor use. Early experiments in tracking factors like blood pressure and stress are said to have been ditched after the sensors proved unreliable and otherwise unworkable. To help mitigate this issue, Apple has reportedly developed a still unannounced software feature of the Apple Watch called Power Reserve, according to the New York Times. Instead, the first-generation device only features motion and heart-rate sensors, once again mirroring some competing smartwatches. Among them was Bryan James, who became an Engineering vice president at Nest early last year. Apple is due to reveal more details about the Watch at a San Francisco press event on March 9th.\n",

Washington expanded its month-long air campaign to Iraq’s Sunni Arab heartland, hitting Islamic State fighters west of Baghdad as troops and allied tribesmen launched a ground assault on Sunday. A picture purporting to show Baghdadi’s bloodied body in fatigues also circulated.

In the footage, a masked man claims Haines was killed because the United Kingdom said it would arm Kurdish fighters to combat ISIS in Iraq. If verified, the execution would constitute \"another disgusting murder,\" the government organization said. A father of two, Haines was kidnapped in Syria while working with an organization that assists refugees from the country’s civil war, the New York Daily News reported. Haines’ relatives pleaded Saturday with ISIS to “make contact” and respond to their messages, NBC News reported. Militants vowed to kill Haines if the United States military did not end military operations against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. The video also contains a threat to second British hostage. The 44-year-old aid worker was kidnapped in March 2013. This time around, the message from the Islamic State is very much aimed at @David_Cameron, with a 2nd British hostage threatened.\n",

During the anniversary last year, Mr Kim and his wife also attended the performance of a national choir and the dedication of new buildings. If he did the same this year, the news would probably have been reported in the North Korean media. No public appearance by the leader has been shown in the media since Sept 3.

He limped around in the beginning, but the injury worsened,” the source told Reuters. Yesterday was the 69th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea.\n",

Professor Perrucci found the text in the archives of the Vatican, while searching amongst a bundle of personal letters and other trivial documents dating from the Roman era.

Paul Wallace of Long Beach, Calif., admits that sporting a gold Apple watch on his wrist would make him a target. What no one knows, outside of Apple, is how much the top of the line \"Watch Edition\" will sell for. So we got to wondering: How much would consumers pay for the top-of-the-line Apple Watch? I could find a watch made of gold for $2,000,\" she said. Will folks be wary of walking out of the store with a multi-thousand-dollar gold watch on their wrists? Estimates online for how much Apple will charge for the top-line watch are all over the map. Thousands of dollars for a gold watch?

      "The term \"18-karat gold,\" he says, likely means the watch is made of solid gold, not gold-plated. Adams says Apple has cheaper manufacturing centers in China than the facilities used by Swiss-based watchmakers, but gold is gold and it is expensive wherever it is crafted. That is not even considering the special process Apple's own metallurgists invented to create gold that is \"twice as hard as standard gold.\" told TechCrunch that an 18-karat gold case that is the size and shape of the Apple Watch could rack up as much as $600 for the raw material. All in all, consumers can expect to pay $1,200 for a gold smartwatch, says Rickicki. Ariel Adams, founder and editor of watch blog aBlogtoWatch, says Apple adopted watch industry terminology for the Apple Watch. Adams thinks the high-end Apple Watch will not cost anything less than $5,000 and could go up as much as $10,000. Sapphire manufacturing, Adams says, is a long and expensive process where the crystals are synthetically grown in large chambers and then cut into rectangles that are then laminated. If, for example, the Apple Watch weighs two ounces, that is already $2,400 just for the gold. The current market price for gold is $1,200 per ounce.\n",

The accounting firm where he worked reportedly fired him after someone from Comcast contacted his employer to say Conal had called to express his displeasure with Comcast. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller’s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked. The story starts as most Comcast stories start: with the cable company charging Conal for services and equipment he neither requested nor used. So Conal decided to escalate the issue to the company's controller, but when he spoke to someone in the office there, she was equally unhelpful. When Conal tried to cancel his subscription in October 2013, Comcast reportedly sent him $1,820 worth of equipment he didn't request — stuff like modems, DVRs, etc. Plus, though his company consulted with Comcast, Conal argues that bringing their name up wouldn't have helped his situation in the first place. According to the Consumerist: Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. When he was fired, Conal’s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees. When Conal created an itemized spreadsheet and took it to the Comcast customer-service reps to show them the overcharges, they refused to acknowledge the mistake.\n",

THE HEART OF THE MATTER I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller’s office. IT BEGAN INNOCENTLY ENOUGH… Conal began subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013 after he says he was sold a 9-month promotional pricing offer. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal’s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he’d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.\n",

It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days,” Dylan said. Doctors extracted a tropical spider that had burrowed itself into the scar from Dylan’s recent appendix removal. NOTHING tops off a holiday in Bali like discovering there is a spider burrowing under your skin. The doctors put the spider in a container and took it away for testing. Later that evening, the trail had moved two or three inches higher. “It was a bit bigger than the size of a match head,” he said. “It was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife,” he said. “That’s when it became painful, it was a searing burn,” he said.

      "The Apple Watch will go on sale in April with 38mm and 42mm cases made from aluminum, stainless steel, and a scratch resistant 18-karat gold. Apple held a private event at the luxury retailer Colette in Paris back in September, hinting at a possible store-within-a-store retail strategy for Apple Watch Edition sales. Apple Watch strap materials include fluoroelastomer (rubber), leather, and stainless steel. The WSJ also corroborates rumors that Apple will be redesigning its stores to include a space where customers can try on the watch by appointment. It’s likely that Apple will be limiting the initial buying experience to its own stores, where the company has total control over the sales experience. Reuters reports that Apple resellers, like Best Buy, may not carry the watch at launch, with Macy’s, Saks, Bloomingdale's, and Barney’s expressing the same. Platinum is the obvious omission, a material commonly used by luxury watch makers such as Rolex and Omega. However, it’s not expected to announce the new case during today’s \"Spring Forward\" event.

      "More than 100 demonstrators marched in St. Louis on Tuesday demanding the arrest of a white police officer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri. Police say Mr Wilson stopped Brown and a friend for walking in the street, asking the two to move to the sidewalk, and words were exchanged. An autopsy concluded that Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times, with two fatal shots to the head. According to Mr Wilson's account, he was attacked by Brown as he attempted to exit his cruiser and the two scuffled for the officer's gun inside the car. The witnesses say the officer fired on the unarmed teen as he had his hands up to surrender. People gathered in small groups at the impromptu memorial set up where Brown died and two women handed out food from a folding table. The majority of people in Ferguson are black, while most of its elected officials and police force are white. The shooting ignited racial tensions, sparking several days and nights of protests, riots, looting and unrest, which have resumed. The tape, provided to CNN, allegedly contains audio captured during a Ferguson resident's video chat at the time of the shooting.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the company originally envisioned a device that can monitor heart rate, blood pressure and stress levels (based on the conductivity of the skin). Its development slowed down once the company realized that a health-focused watch that meets its standards will be very hard to build at this time. Still, the company's expecting to sell a ton, reportedly ordering around 6 million units from its Asian suppliers just for the first quarter. The company has a good track record of substantially improving its devices after a debut model appears -- the first iPhone didn't have 3G. Apple apparently wanted its smartwatches to focus heavily on health-related features, but the company was forced to changed direction mid-development.

In a mass influx of basicness, it seems Durex may or may not be hopping on the pumpkin spice bandwagon. If there’s anything that could get the population on the condom train it would have to be the PSL trend, right? This past weekend, images of a Starbucks PSL-inspired condom took social media by storm. Is this a ploy to get basic bitches of the world to stop procreating?

Security and intelligence services monitor those who come back to see if they have renounced the terror network’s barbaric regime or whether they remain suspected terrorists plotting UK atrocities. Middle East-based intelligence analyst Benjamin Decker said IS's killing of medics and its decision to ban Westerners from its territory could allow Ebola to spread rapidly. Sources at a hospital in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul say they have seen suspected cases involving two IS fighters. The organisation is trying to contact Iraqi officials to see if help can provided to investigate any suspected cases in rebel-controlled areas of the country. Intelligence experts have already urged authorities to be ready for members of the extremist outfit deliberately trying to spread Ebola in the West. IS fighters have reportedly killed more than a dozen doctors, who may have been able to confirm the diagnoses, in Mosul. Al-Sabaah, an Iraqi newspaper, said two cases of Ebola and 26 of AIDS were reported in the city.

In particular, experts questioned the credibility of Danladi Ahmadu, who the government said was Boko Haram’s representative in the talks. But some experts questioned the credibility of the officials’ claims, in part because news of the agreement comes as President Jonathan prepares to launch a re-election bid. The Nigerian government has lied about the girls several times in the past. The government even once claimed to have rescued the girls.

If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series. AppleInsider will be covering the \"Spring forward\" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week.\n",

      "The virus, which has claimed thousands of lives in West Africa, is believed to have been brought to the city by jihadists from several different countries. Local newspaper al Sabaah has claimed that the virus was brought to Mosul by terrorists arriving from several countries in Africa. Since Ebola shares symptoms with other diseases including malaria and yellow fever, it is also possible that the cases so far have been misdiagnosed. While the former two have seen the transmission rate go down significantly in the past couple of months, Sierra Leone remains in a fierce battle to contain the virus. ISIS captured several cities across Iraq and Syria in 2014, and has been seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate in the region. The World Health Organization is investigating reports that ISIS militants have contracted the deadly Ebola virus and are seeking help at a hospital in Mosul in Iraq. The Daily Mail pointed out that there is no information on whether doctors still working in Mosul are trained or equipped to fight a possible Ebola outbreak. Over a dozen doctors have reportedly been executed by ISIS in recent weeks for refusing to treat their injured fighters. Feig said that the Iraqi government hasn't yet responded to the news of possible Ebola cases in the country.

The NASA update also called the meteorite report from Managua \"unrelated\" to RC 2014, citing the 13-hour difference in the asteroid flyby and the crater explosion. \"There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion, so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact.\" However, NASA asteroid expert Don Yeomans, author of Near-Earth Objects: Finding Them Before They Find Us, says that outside experts suspect the crater wasn't caused by an impact. The blast left a hole 40 feet (12 meters) wide and 19 feet (5 meters) deep outside the international airport serving Nicaragua's capital. Some Nicaraguan astronomers quoted in early news reports attributed the blast to a chip off a weekend asteroid flyby. Radar observations indicate that the asteroid is about 40 feet (12 meters) across and rotates rapidly, several times a minute. In some news reports, geophysicist Wilfried Strauch of Nicaragua's Institute of Earth Studies attributed the crater to a meteorite impact.

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight’s Monday Night Countdown. ESPN also posted a list of highlights for tonight’s “Monday Night Football” broadcast, which includes no discussion about domestic violence. Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. ESPN reporter Jane McManus took to Twitter to debunk Esquire’s domestic violence panel story. There was never a domestic violence panel planned for MNF tonight.

On the plus side, the film is based on Walter Isaacson's biography of the late Apple CEO—titled simply, \"Steve Jobs\"—which was Amazon's best-selling book for 2011. If you ask Sorkin, though, the movie isn't entirely biographical per se. The comic actor would join Christian Bale, who is tipped to play Jobs, according to Variety.

His songs like Dreamer, Flying High and Overdose were hits on the popular BBC radio, but they are important pieces of evidence today, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Breaking news on Sunday morning reports that senior western intelligence officials confirm that the London rapper is the major suspect in the beheading of James Foley. While news that Bary was suspected to be the man seen on the video beheading Foley hit early this weekend. Those recordings of his songs that once played on the radio are a treasure trove of data used by the investigators today. Bary’s recording music has been of vital importance when using the high-tech equipment to identify the voice on the video. Dressed all in black with a mask covering his face, the executioner beheaded James Foley, an American journalist, on a video that was later posted on YouTube by ISIS. On Sunday morning it is confirmed that he is the main suspect and not just one of many. The beheading of James Foley is not the end of the violence from this group warn officials.\n"

      "The organization, also known as ISIS, had threatened to kill Haines just under two weeks ago, in an earlier video that showed the beheading of an American journalist. Update at 8:50 p.m. EDT The militant group that calls itself the Islamic State has released a video that purportedly shows the beheading of British aid worker David Haines. The newest video, like those previous videos, appears to name another Western hostage as a future target. ISIS previously released two videos showing the beheadings of two American journalists, which were confirmed by U.S. officials to be authentic. The video appears to be recent, Alice says: \"The assailant refers to the bombing of Iraq's Haditha dam a week ago. Another man identified as a British hostage appears at the end as the masked man exhorts Prime Minister Cameron to stop fighting the Islamic State.\" The first video, which showed the killing of James Foley, was released on August 20. NPR's correspondent Alice Fordham, reporting for our Newscast unit, says the video begins with footage of British prime minister David Cameron. The BBC reports that the 44-year-old father of two from Perth, Scotland, was kidnapped shortly after he began working with a French relief agency called ACTED. The authenticity of the video, which appeared online Saturday, has not been independently confirmed by NPR.\n"

The robots are packed with HD security cameras and sensors to take in their organic, protein-based surroundings.

There are, however, plans equip the robots with tasers sometime in the future. All they can do is assess a situation, sound an alarm to defuse it, or call a human security officer to the scene.

A spokesman said: \"We are certainly not aware of Banksy being arrested in Watford, or anywhere else for that matter.\" The great artist?— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) October 20, 2014 You have to be kidding me, @metpoliceuk. US website National Report alleged the Metropolitan Police had held the elusive graffiti artist after he was traced by a \"24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force\". However, Scotland Yard confirmed the story - which left Banksy's name trending on Twitter - was fake. He was said to be in custody “without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting”. She fell for the scam and criticised the Metropolitan Police for not focusing on the \"so many other criminals out there\".\n",

If he failed a test for some sort of recreational substance, the tour's policy is not to disclose any penalties. He also told ESPN.com's Michael Collins on Monday that the information he got about the suspension was not first-hand. Only two players have run afoul of the drug testing guidelines and both were suspended for a year. \"It's not testosterone, but it's something else,'' Olsen said. \"There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,\" Votaw said.\n",

Wrong: Once at the park, the man pulled food from the bag and shared it with his fellow homeless. Let's face it: Many of us hesitate to hand money to the homeless, concerned they will spend it in ways we'd consider unwise. Lin decided to take action, setting up a crowdfunding page to raise money to help Thomas get off the streets. Thomas said that he'd quit his job to take care of his sick parents, then lost his family home after they died. \"People think I changed his life,\" said Lin, who maintains the video was not staged. And sure enough, the man's first stop was at a liquor store. He apologized and gave Thomas more money. He emerged with a bag and took it to a nearby park.

Officials said the remains of nine people had been taken down from the hillside so far, with another 25 due to follow. Thirty people, including 22 police, have been arrested in connection with the violence, which claimed the lives of at least six people and left 25 injured.

According to reports, beginning January 1, 2015, McDonald’s will no longer serve customers with a weight capacity over 170 lbs for women and 245 lbs for men. McDonald’s is currently running campaigns to shake its “junk food” image, insisting they sell nothing but good quality food. They are are branding themselves from “A dining experience of fast food” to “Good food served fast.” A fake article was published on the mostly fake news site DailyBuzzLive.com. McDonald’s will not stop serving overweight customers starting January 1, 2015. Those few articles are for entertainment purposes only.

      "HBO is reportedly in talks with Apple to be the launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service that wouldn't require a cable subscription, according to International Business Times. Presumably, the HBO Now launch must navigate the complexities of HBO's longstanding relationship with cable carriers—Time Warner, HBO's parent company, reportedly makes 70% of its profits from cable subscriptions. But if the current negotiations with Apple are successful, the Now service could be HBO's first crack at making good on its promise to cord cutters. Fans of HBO's programming, who increasingly occupy a demographic that's moving away from cable, have long craved a cable-free streaming service—but HBO has deflected the matter for years. HBO's existing streaming app HBO Go is currently available only through a cable subscription. The new season of Game of Thrones starts next month, and you know what that means: Cue the mad dash to secure someone's HBO Go password in time. So it's likely a safe bet that recent HBO content would be available through the Apple service. HBO Now, as it's allegedly being called, would cost $15/month and open up access to HBO's film and TV titles to distributors like Apple TV and Roku.\n",

      "What Ferguson police have released is a report with little more than the date, time and location of the incident. They said Wilson fired a single shot from inside his car and then fired several more as Brown attempted to flee. The recording suggests nearly a dozen shots were fired in an altercation between Brown, who was unarmed at the time, and Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Simultaneously, they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown,” Glide said in a statement released on Thursday. Federal officials won’t confirm they have this specific recording, but do confirm they are collecting any audio and video of the incident. According to Glide the recording was created at 12:02 p.m. CT on Saturday Aug. 9, precisely the time police say Brown was shot. Witnesses claim that as Brown fell to his knees and attempted to surrender to Wilson that the officer continued to walk toward him, firing several more shots. It also seems to confirm what some witnesses to the shooting say happened during the incident. The audio does not capture what happened just moments before or after the shooting. They said Brown, who was black, and Wilson, who is white, were seen struggling through the driver’s side window of Wilson’s police car.\n",

      "Madden described her duties under the KJI regime to CNN, calling her an “advance-team leader” who inspected sites before official visits and performed administrative duties. If true, this would suggest that the Kim dynasty is still perfectly intact, and a coup is just one of the many wild theories. It’s been more than a month since North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un’s last public appearance. In the last 36 days, rumors have swirled, increasing in bizarre factor with each absent day — gout, diabetes, ankle problems, cheese-induced illness, etc. Now, Madden says, she has taken on even more responsibility as a regular fixture by Kim Jong-un’s side, receiving intelligence briefings and contributing to policy. The group has not revealed its source, so it’s just an allegation at this point, but one that makes sense. According to North Korea Leadership Watch, Kim Yo-jong works as her brother’s personal aide and manages his itineraries, public events, and logistical needs. In fact, Madden believes that she played a large part in planning the three officials’ trip to the Asian Games in South Korea. While Kim has a half-sister, whom his father, Kim Jong-il had with another wife, Kim Yo-jong is his only full sister. Hwang’s appearance only further suggests that the OGD have seized control of the regime.\n",

Government sources insisted that while the option of British air strikes on the jihadists remained on the table, they “are not being actively considered or proposed at this stage”. Pentagon sources claimed President Barack Obama agonised for weeks over whether to authorise a mission to rescue Foley and other foreign hostages. “They were ready to go in June to grab the guy and they weren’t permitted,” said Anthony Shaffer, a former lieutenant colonel who worked on covert operations. Military planners are, however, drawing up plans to deploy scores of British troops to help train a “substantial” number of Iraqi troops and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. Unless Islamic State is stopped, “sooner or later they will seek to strike us on British soil”, he wrote. The comments are the most ­explicit warning yet from a British cabinet minister about the risk of an attack against the country. Writing in The Sunday Times yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond accused Foley’s killer of “an utter betrayal” of everything the British people stand for. “It is horrifying to think that the perpetrator of this ­heinous act could have been brought up in Britain,” he wrote. The intelligence agencies and police estimate up to 20 British extremists a month are now travelling to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamic State.\n"

      "A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric apparently issued a religious ruling, officially called as a ‘Fatwa’, forbidding the building of snowmen. How does one have fun building a snow sculpture of a tree, isn’t what the religious leader pondered much upon. The leader confirmed his viewpoint on a website where one of the members had asked whether it was OK for fathers to build snowmen for their children. The country’s northern regions have been recently lashed by multiple snowstorms leaving in their wake sporadic accumulations of snow that will soon melt away. The religious scholar, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid strongly believes that building snowmen isn’t an acceptable Islamic practice and it should cease with immediate effect. Apparently, any cleric in Saudi Arabia is entitled to issue a fatwa. As amusing as it might sound, children might now be left with other “inanimate” objects only. He argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being. However, they are to strictly base their rulings on the teachings of Islam and must have valid basis under Saudi law. What’s wrong with building a snowman?\n",

      "The arrest reportedly took place in the past week and followed information provided by western intelligence agencies in the past fortnight. Analysts in Iraq said that, if true, the arrest would not necessarily yield useful intelligence. The video’s authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants. Lebanese security officials described the woman as a “high-value catch” and said the identity of the boy was confirmed through DNA testing. The video also includes audio clips of IS group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia. If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by IS supporters. The Lebanese army says it has detained the second wife of the Islamic State (Isis) leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and their eight-year-old son near the Syrian border. Meanwhile, Isis supporters released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month. The arrest could be used as a bargaining chip against Isis, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners.\n",

Johnson also said that there was no struggle for the gun, but rather that Wilson drew the weapon and shot Brown once at the car. Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer. Police have said Brown was trying to grab the officer's gun. But a woman who identified herself as a friend of Wilson called in to a St. Louis radio show with what she said was the officer's version of events. Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four. Simultaneously, they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown,\" the company said. But if the gunfire heard on the audio is from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

Our correspondent says refugees watching their town from a hilltop nearby agree that there are only two or three neighbourhoods that are still the scene of fighting. Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State are training its members in Syria to fly three captured fighter jets, according to a UK-based activist group that monitors the conflict. New coordination Separately, the Iraqi government said its troops had gained ground to the north and west of Tikrit and cut an important IS supply route. Meanwhile Kurdish forces, backed by US-led air strikes, are continuing to fight militants in the northern Syrian town of Kobane.

It can only be used to induce intimidation.” “Experts have not been able to prove its use in the battles of southern Dalouiya and Saqlawiya,” he added.

      "The aid worker had traveled to the Turkish-Syrian border in December 2012 to work with groups providing support to Syrian refugees, a family spokesperson said in a statement. The group’s media outlets released the video of Kasasbeh’s death on Tuesday, but Jordanian officials belief that he had been killed about a month earlier. Last week the militant group prompted outrage around the world when they released a video of Jordanian pilot Muadh al-Kasasbeh being burned to death. Unusually for Isis, the militants did not provide footage or photographic evidence of Mueller’s purported death as it has done with previous hostages. Over the past seven months, Isis has killed three American hostages: journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig. Two Japanese hostages, Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, were killed in December, as were two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning. [I will not let this be] something we just accept,” Mueller said. In a story in her hometown paper, the Prescott Daily Courrier, Mueller said she felt drawn to help after learning more about the situation in war-torn Syria. “The criminal crusader coalition planes targeted sites outside Raqqa city today at noon time while people were performing Friday prayers,” the message read. A second female western hostage is believed to remain in the hands of Isis militants in Syria.\n",

However, if Apple really does intend to release the device early next year, mass production should already have started. Quanta has started its preparations for the mass production of the Apple Watch, increasing its workforce to a total of 4 million employees, reported G for Games. In the event, Apple said that the Apple Watch will begin to be sold to the public in early 2015 without specifying a definite time frame. According to a news source from Taiwan, the mass production stage of the Apple Watch will not begin until January. The device is Apple's first entry into the wearable technology market, wherein rivals such as Samsung and LG and startup companies such as Pebble have already established their presence. There is also said to be an agreement between Apple and Quanta that the Chinese supplier will not be manufacturing smartwatches for Apple's rival companies in the industry. The delay will only add to the conservative expectations that Piper Jaffray investment firm analyst Gene Munster has on the sales forecasts for the Apple Watch. Munster forecasts 10 million Apple Watches sold in 2015, with a selling price of an average of $500. The Apple Watch was unveiled by Apple on Sept. 9, in the same event where the company unveiled the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.\n",

Islamist militants claim to have beheaded a man identified as James Foley, an American journalist kidnapped in Syria in late 2012, in a graphic video posted on the internet. The posting of the latest video by Isis comes days after President Barack Obama ordered an intensifying series of air strikes on the militants in northern Iraq. An estimated 500 Britons have travelled to fight with extremist groups in Syria – most from London – and almost all have joined Isis, according to UK security officials. Early assessments by many in the Western intelligence community concluded that Isis was primarily a group focused on a violent regional and sectarian struggle. The group has inherited many of the hallmarks of AQI, and has been posting videos of beheadings of Assad-regime soldiers and Iraqi Shia and Kurds online for months. A spokeswoman for the White House said the intelligence community was trying to determine the video’s authenticity. British intelligence believes that several have travelled into Iraq and that some have almost certainly been involved in the worst of Isis’ atrocities. “We believe that Isis needs to be taken out,” Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said this week.

He tells Josh he's just trying to get enough to buy something to eat and Josh shocks him with the $100. \"You went to a liquor store earlier —\" \"You thought I was going to get all smacked up drunk, huh?\" He meets an elderly man with gray hair, a mustache and dark jacket named Thomas holding up a sign along a highway. There's a lot of good people that are homeless,\" he said. The video records him exit the store with several bags, but he didn't buy alcohol. Ironically during Josh's confession a man sitting at a picnic table behind them takes a swig from a bottle wrapped in a plastic bag. His mom died two weeks later from kidney failure and suddenly their building was sold leaving Thomas without a place to live.\n",

      "A reported witness said the action was intended to send out a message that sexual assault was not tolerated. A man had his genitals chopped off and thrown into the street by an angry mob in India for allegedly sexually assaulting a young woman. Alleged attacker Suresh Kumar, 40, molested a teenager in a street, but her screams for help alerted a crowd which came to her aid. According to local authorities, the extreme action was a response to high-profile incidences of sexual attacks in India. Kumar was dragged into a nearby butcher's shop and beaten heavily with sticks for nearly an hour, according to reports. World-wide condemnation greeted the gang-rape of a student on a bus two years ago, which shook the image of the country. Vigilantes then hacked at his genitals with a meat cleaver, before throwing them into the street. \"This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.\" It happened in Ganganagar in the north-western state of Rajasthan, in graphic scenes captured on video.

Elsewhere, locals said that dozens of suspected Boko Haram gunmen had stormed the town of Abadam, north of Maiduguri near Lake Chad, on Thursday, before the supposed ceasefire. Nigerian military and intelligence officials raised doubts on Sunday about the validity of a ceasefire with Boko Haram, with reports of fresh attacks and fighting in the country's northeast.

A senior intelligence official in the region also indicated to AFP that he had not received word about the purported ceasefire. He said the attack, in the village of Wagga on Saturday, saw some 40 women abducted – an established Boko Haram tactic in its bloody five-year insurgency.

In December schoolboy Sam Lee, 14, caught an 8ft 14 stone catfish while on a fishing holiday in Spain with his father Peter. The giant catfish immediately bolted 100 metres downstream, but Sam, from Chester, hung on and after a 35 minute battle finally landed the 2.5 metre-long fish. Dino Ferrari hooked the huge wels catfish, which was 2.67m in length, last week in the Po Delta in Italy. Recently, wels catfish have been spotted in non-native habitats lunging out of the water to grab pigeons on land. The wels catfish is scaleless and lives in fresh and brackish water. The aptly named Tom Herron, 68, from Launceston, battled the cream-coloured monster fish in the River Segre, Mequinenza, Spain, for 40 minutes before finally hauling it in. In time honoured tradition, he then posed for a photo to secure bragging rights before letting the creature swim back into the water at the River Ebro in Catalonia.

Special forces arrived at the target location, in a remote al-Qaeda safe haven in the desert near Yemen’s border with Saudi Arabia, to find Mr Somers was not there. The American government considers AQAP to be the world's most dangerous arm of the international terrorist organisation after linking it to several failed attacks on US soil. American authorities rarely discuss their controversial drone strike campaign in Yemen, which are known to cause civilian casualties, legitimising violent resistance against US intervention in the country. Al-Qaeda and Islamist militants have gained a foothold in large parts of southern and eastern Yemen, where the government is struggling to exert control outside main cities.

A gunman fired multiple shots at the National War Memorial in Ottawa on Wednesday and shot a Canadian soldier, Reuters reports. The incident comes just a day after police killed a Muslim convert in Quebec after he had hit two soldiers with his car. From the Associated Press: OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) -- Police say a soldier standing guard at the National War Memorial has been by an unknown gunman. Others on the Hill told Canadian Press they heard shots being fired in several different corridors. Emergency responders are still on the scene and paramedics took the wounded soldier away in an ambulance. The gunman then ran towards Parliament Hill, which is located across the street from the National War Memorial. According to Member of Parliament Bob Zimmer, the intruder was shot inside the Parliament building. The top spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Harper was safe and had left Parliament Hill.\n",

      "Experts studying the crater said it was not clear whether the meteorite had disintegrated upon impact or had been blasted into soil. Astronomer Humberto Saballos said the meteorite could have broken off from the 2014RC asteroid which passed Earth at the same time. Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said the meteorite seemed to have broken off an asteroid which was passing close to Earth. 'Like a bomb' An adviser to Nicaragua's Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter), Wilfried Strauch, said he was \"convinced it was a meteorite\" which caused the impact. \"All the evidence that we've confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event,\" he said. \"We have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact,\" he added. A small meteorite landed near the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, on Saturday night, government officials say. Locals said they heard a large blast just before midnight local time and reported a burning smell. Ineter scientist Jose Millan said that \"we need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population\". Residents reported hearing a loud bang and feeling the impact, which left a crater 12m (40ft) wide and 5m deep.\n"

DeJeus was not only a Disney fanatic, but also a porn star. In fact, her face is never shown in the video, only her voice, toys and hands. However, a recent report reveals the true identity of the YouTube hit and the identity is somewhat shocking. DC Toy Collector is the “highest paid performer” on YouTube making nearly $5 million last year unboxing Disney toys. DeJeus has went to unfathomable measures to ensure her identity remained secret and for good reason. However, little has been known about the woman-behind-the-hands of the popular YouTube channel.\n",

A temple in the ruins of the Parthian city of Hatra, where scorpion bombs were first used in 189/199AD She describes how soldiers would spit on the end of the scorpion to calm the creatures before they were packed into pots, which were flung at the besieging Romans. The live grenades were first used by Iraqis in the besieged city of Hatra in 198-199AD. The biological weapon has been credited with ending the 20 day siege on the desert city. Mr de Bretton-Gordon, who returned from Baghdad last week where he was advising security forces, said that the bombs are not causing casualties but had a profound 'psychological impact'. The Parthian city was held under siege for 20 days by Emperor Septimius Severus before the Roman military were driven out by the 'live grenades'. 'It was the brute effectiveness of Hatra's defensive biological and chemical weapons that overcame Roman morale, manpower and siege machines,' she writes.\n",

She came back to North Korea roughly four years later, but not much is known about her activities until 2008, when she began to participate in the country's politics. Kim Jong Un was the middle child of this relationship, second to an older brother, while Kim Yo Jong is the former supreme leader's youngest child. She may have started working for her father or her aunt back in 2008 as a \"junior\" member of the party, according to NK Leadership Watch. This is less likely to be a coup — and more likely, he said, that Kim Yo Jong is relaying her brother's orders while he takes a break. Her father, according to Madden, used to go around telling his friends about his daughter's sharp political mind. “She was one of the only ones that was distinctly interested in politics, in North Korean politics,\" Madden said.

      "Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri spoke with Apple's supply chain to learn that the Apple Watch will most likely come in two different storage capacities: 4GB and 8GB. This means you'll be able to store apps, messages, fitness data, and other types of files and information directly on the watch. The Apple Watch won't be released until early 2015, so we expect to learn more about it over the next several months. Arcuri believes the 4GB edition will be the more popular mainstream version, noting that the 8GB watch probably won't be the default configuration. When Apple unveiled its first smartwatch earlier this month, the company told us a lot about its design, customization options, and the type of features we can expect. This means that if Apple does release an 8GB version, it'll offer twice as much storage as current smartwatches. This chip will reportedly be similar to the wireless chip found inside the iPhone 5s, Arcuri wrote. Both Samsung's Gear 2 and Sony's Smartwatch 3 also come with 4GB of storage space. What we didn't hear about, however, is the technology Apple will use to power the watch. That amount of storage space is fairly standard for smartwatches.\n",

The company's first smartwatch will be available in three versions: Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition. The mid-tier Apple Watch could start at anywhere from $499 to $549 and likely will come closer to an average selling price of $650, according to Munster. Munster remains bearish on Apple Watch sales, estimating 8 million in unit sales this year, compared with Wall Street forecasts of 14 million. But the top-of-the-line Apple Watch Edition could break the bank, starting at $4,999 and potentially reaching closer to $7,500 by factoring in high-end, expensive bands. Munster said he believes the elastomer bands for the Apple Watch Sport will range in price from $29 to $39. On March 9, Apple is expected to finally unveil the finer details of its Apple Watch, including the price tags and launch date.

      "But the gossip mill started up again last week when Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang. Such is the fascination with North Korea, the world’s most impenetrable country, that rumors spread like wildfire. He has not been seen in public since Sept. 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. Nevertheless, it is true that Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. It aired just before the session of the assembly, North Korea’s quasi-parliament, was broadcast, the Daily NK Web site reported. In Washington, U.S. officials said they had no information about North Korea’s leader. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence. “I can just say that I have no confirmation of the reports,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. Outside commentators have guessed that Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. But they are almost always impossible to verify.\n",

Additionally, multiple sources revealed that Apple is planning a comprehensive testing program to train retail store employees on the new product between Feb. 9-16. For one, the company refused to describe the product as a “smartwatch” — something that separated their gadget from competitors’. All that Apple revealed was that the device — its first foray into wearables — would be unveiled sometime in early 2015. If there are any setbacks in terms of software development or manufacturing, the Apple Watch may not hit stores until April or later. The program will entail sending one to two associates from each U.S. store to the company's offices in Cupertino, California or Austin, Texas.

And despite the rumors, Venezuelan state media reported that he landed in Iran today, with no apparent emergencies to attend to on the Western Hemisphere. Rumors strengthened this week, however, as the anniversary of Castro’s last appearance approached. Pérez tweeted that, almost immediately after publishing the blog post, the Cuban government shut down his entire page, at least within Cuba. But dissidents continue to report strange incidents that give fuel to the rumor that, if not dead, Castro is close to death. The Cuban Foreign Ministry denied that any such press conference was scheduled for today, however, or that they had any major news to break. His Twitter account appeared unscathed, however, where he posted images of Cubans wearing American flag leggings after the announcement of President Obama’s concessions to the Castros. Nonetheless, Venezuelan opposition media are reporting that his departure from China was indicative enough of a route back to Cuba.

Two U.S. officials say they believe American journalist James Foley was the victim executed by ISIS militants as shown in a grisly video released Tuesday. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the hostage situation by name. In its annual report last November, CPJ concluded that the missing journalists are either being held and threatened with death by extremists, or taken captive by gangs seeking ransom. The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control.

It’s not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes, although it’s likely that some were. The group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al-Qaida in Iraq, which beheaded many of its victims, including Americans businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004. Since Aug. 8, the U.S. military has struck more than 70 Islamic State targets – including security checkpoints, vehicles and weapons caches.

Banksy is an artist who makes a living from exhibiting his work, he wouldn't want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad. Because of Banksy's continued anonymity, and the often confusing similarity to other graffiti artists, many works of art end up mistakenly labeled as created by Banksy.

Still, the NYPD defended the high number of arrests, with Willam Bratton, de Blasio’s police commissioner, saying that Thompson’s decision would not affect the NYPD’s approach to marijuana possession. Misdemeanor-level marijuana possession accounts for a large percentage of the city’s arrests, a vast majority of which happen to young black or Latino men living in poor neighborhoods. The policy to be announced on Monday will mark the first time the current administration will take concerted action to address the disparities in marijuana arrests. Possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana has not been a crime in New York State since 1977. This broad interpretation of “public view” helped low-level marijuana possession become one of the NYPD’s most commonly used arrest charges during stop-and-frisks. By 2013, the NYPD was making only 28,000 marijuana possession arrests — still a large number, but 47% less than in 2010. The new policy, which was first reported by the New York Times, would bring about a sea change in the way the city is policed. The report also found that the geography of the arrests is highly segregated, with dominantly white neighborhoods seeing fewer arrests than neighborhoods of color with similar per-capita incomes.

The 50-year-old man, who was blindfolded throughout his sickening fall, is seen to be still alive after hitting the ground below. She was determined to find her son and went to IS headquarters and asked to see him. The depraved story was relayed by a brave Briton fighting on the front line with Kurdish forces against the Islamic State, also referred to as IS, ISIS and ISIL. In February, IS released a highly-choreographed propaganda film showing Jordanian fighter pilot Lieutenant Mouath al-Kasaesbeh soaked in fuel and being burned alive inside a cage. Cruel militants delayed talks with the elderly mum – feeding her a meal made with the corpse of her offspring while she waited.

Mohammad Saleh Al Minjed said people must not build any snowmen or snow models of animals, according to Gulf News. However, making snow models of lifeless things, such as ships, fruit and buildings, was apparently acceptable in Islam, the scholar said. \"God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,\" he added. Another stated: \"We have snow for fleeting days, maybe even hours, and there is always someone who wants to rob us of the joy and the fun. \"It has no value in our traditions, and those who are fascinated by the West should emulate their inventions and sciences, not their culture,\" one unnamed blogger said.

She also recently helped wildlife rescue groups save an injured sparrow hawk by pinning a broken wing, so that it could recover and be released. ■ Goldfish can grow more than a foot long, but can be stunted by being kept in tanks too small for them and where the water quality is poor.

The meteorite crashed into a wooded area close to Managua’s Augusto C. Sandino International Airport around midnight and left a remarkable 12-meter diameter crater, 5 meters deep. In a statement on Monday, NASA said it’s possible that a meteorite caused the crater, but the American space agency also expressed doubt.

      "If the audio is from the exact moment when Brown was shot, then the gunfire heard on the tape clearly reveals that the officer paused before firing more shots. A new piece of audio has emerged that allegedly is a recording of the exact moment when Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot unarmed teen Michael Brown on Aug. 9. Six shots can be heard in rapid succession, followed by a brief pause before four more shots are fired. The Daily News notes that if the audio is verified, the pause in firing could add weight to witnesses' claims. Witnesses have told both police and news stations that Brown, 18, was unarmed and running away with his hands up when Wilson began shooting. \"That was what caught my attention initially,\" said Lopa Blumenthal, a lawyer for the unnamed man who claims to have made the recording. An independent autopsy indicates that Brown was hit at least six times, four in his arm and twice in the head. CNN aired the tape Monday but was unable to independently verify its authenticity. \"It shows a point of contemplation.\"\n",

That being said, we’ll need much more than talk radio allegations to put Tiger into the same LIARFRAUDCHEATER category as Lance Armstrong. It’s been hammered over and over by golf analysts that Tiger’s struggles in recent years have had more to do with his head than physical ailments. “There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,” Votaw said. “Over the past year, Woods has withdrawn with an injury three times and now fallen outside of the 70 in the world. “His back’s not hurt,” Olsen said. “I’ve heard that he’s suspended,” said Olsen. “We categorically deny these allegations.” The Tour almost never comments on disciplinary matters.

Until I see confirmed video or actual confirmed meteorite fragments I’ll remain doubtful. It’s incredibly unlikely that a small piece of that asteroid was that far ahead of the main mass and still managed to hit us. Bottom line: This may or may not have been an impact from a meteorite. A crater was found in the woods measuring something like 12 meters (40 feet) across. Claims are being made that this was a meteorite impact, a space rock a meter or so across slamming into the ground at high speed. I am not saying this was not a meteorite impact. I am saying the evidence for this that I’ve seen so far leaves me pretty unconvinced. The situation in Chelyabinsk in 2013 was different, of course, but video of that event showed up with an hour or two.

Then there’s the matter of the game’s marketing, which thus far has consisted of poorly conceived attempts at creating some viral buzz, all of which have fallen completely flat. It’s all very strange and seems to suggest a desperation to create buzz, even in a so-bad-its-good way, though none of it ever caught on. In fact, Electric Boogie was published under the name Qbical LLC, which is also based out of Denton, Tex., the same city where TriplePlay Apps is supposedly located.

For example, an Imgur gallery of horrible Electric Boogie parody movie posters had been submitted to several different subreddits before most of the links were eventually deleted. Why would the developers of the game trash it on YouTube? A Google search of any of the names associated with the company, from the CEO to the disgruntled David Gordon, returns absolutely nothing.

      "Since July, the Brooklyn district attorney’s office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases involving police arrests, or about 34 percent of the total 2,526 such cases in Brooklyn. But his announcement did not go over well with Mr. de Blasio and his police commissioner, William J. Bratton, who vowed to continue making low-level marijuana arrests. In 1977, the Legislature in New York moved to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana that were not in public view. The remainder of those arrested for marijuana possession were “put through the system,” meaning they were held for up to 24 hours before being arraigned before a judge. Photo The administration of Bill de Blasio is publicly embracing the notion that small-scale drug possession merits different treatment than arrests. Under the new policy, for example, will the 25 grams or less that constitutes misdemeanor possession under state law be the threshold below which a summons is issued? That meant that carrying a small bag of marijuana hidden in a pocket was supposed to be a ticket-eligible violation that did not amount to a crime. While campaigning for mayor, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, emphatically criticized the department’s marijuana arrest practices. But the new policy could push prosecutors out of the process, because summonses issued without an accompanying arrest generally do not receive prosecutorial review. “By allowing these cases to avoid early review, by issuing a summons, there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place.\n"

In response, director Zack Snyder took to Twitter (as he does) to send up not only the stolen-Batmobile rumor, but to reference a competing franchise.

Instagram users posted several pictures of the new, updated Batmobile, which was promptly followed by an official photo released by director Zack Snyder.

The exciting design appears to be something of a hybrid between the tank-like vehicle used in Christopher Nolan’s Bat-films and more traditional, hot rod-inspired Batmobiles of old. It would seem so, but what if Snyder had used, say, a Joker or Two-Face lookalike – or at least one of their henchmen? The attention to detail is pretty funny, too – the way the Gotham PD cop nearest the Batmobile is looking at the Stormtrooper’s blaster is priceless.

Now North Korea watchers believe Scotland may be the next prime location, largely thanks to the popularity of whisky among the communist ruling elite. The chain has begun springing up across China and Asia, with proceeds funnelled back to North Korea to help prop up the secretive regime. They are run in partnership with Office 39, a secretive branch of the North Korean government, which uses them as a legal way of raising overseas cash. KIM Jong-un could try and open a restaurant in Scotland serving delicacies such as dog meat soup, North Korea experts claim. The state-run food outlets - which began springing up about 10 years ago - channel up to 30% of takings back to Pyongyang. This comes after the controversial leader brought his chain, The 'Pyongyang' restaurants, over to Europe by launching one in Holland.

The smaller the manufacturing process, the smaller the chips and the less energy they consume. Perhaps it comes down to price, or it could be that TSMC is already stretched supplying chips for iPhones and iPads. Each wafer can supply several hundred processors. According to supply chain rumors, a Samsung processor will power the Apple Watch. Samsung used to manufacture chips for the iPhone or iPad, but it was replaced by TSMC.

      "Chandler, 41, wrote a lengthy Facebook post outlining her journey but admits that she has never told some people, including Phelps, about her past. [...] The problem is I have made friends that I never told and dated and married people that knew nothing of my past. Or a person may be born with genitals that seem to be in-between the usual male and female types. I was never a man, never lived as a man. Taylor Lianne Chandler, a woman who claims to be Michael Phelps' girlfriend, has revealed that she was born intersex and was given the name David Roy Fitch at birth. For example, a person might be born appearing to be female on the outside, but having mostly male-typical anatomy on the inside. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man. Chandler says she met Phelps on the dating app Tinder and described their relationship as being \"like a teenage love affair.\" On Wednesday, she wrote, \"Heard from Michael he is out of rehab and back home,\" while also expressing frustration about how her story is being reported. She writes: By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one.\n",

      "Nigeria's military says it killed Shekau a year ago, and authorities said in September that they had also killed an imposter posting as him in videos. They robbed banks, burned down houses and hoisted their black flag over the Emir's palace, killing dozens of people and forcing thousands to flee, witnesses in Mubi said. The man in the video also denied there was a ceasefire, and denounced Ahmadu, who says he represents Boko Haram in Chad. A car bomb thought to have been planted by Boko Haram killed at least 10 people at a crowded bus stop in Gombe on Friday morning, emergency services said. Shekau's denial of the ceasefire appears supported by the violence since the government announced it two weeks ago. Its fighters have attacked targets almost every day for weeks and last week seized control of Mubi, the home town of Nigeria's defense chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh. \"We have have married them off and they are all in their husbands' houses,\" the man claiming to be Shekau says. He says also that they are holding a \"white man.\" If we meet him now we will cut off his head,\" the man in the video says.

      "Those investigating the mass grave found video showing the police officers arresting and taking away an undisclosed number of students. On Saturday, the burned bodies of 28 people, believed to be missing student protesters, were found in a mass grave just outside the city center. The students went missing on September 25 after a protest over hiring practices at the Ayotzinapa Normal School turned violent. This time, police officers reportedly opened fire on the protesters, killing three. Police officers in Iguala have been linked to the Guerreros Unidos gang, including the mayor and chief of security, both of whom are wanted for arrest. Thus far, authorities have charged 22 police officers with involvement in the crime, as well as seven others. The students are known as radicals who have done battle with police in the past. He believes experts will need at least 15 days for the identification process, as many of the bodies have been dismembered and are charred beyond visual recognition. Just a short two-hour drive away from Mexico City, Iguala is plagued by the tragic triangulation between gangsters, crooked cops, and beleaguered government officials. However, officials and students tell very different stories of how the protests ended.\n",

A MYSTERIOUS explosion that rocked Nicaragua’s crowded capital Managua, creating a large crater, appears to have been caused by a small meteorite. One of them, William Martinez, said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil. “You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,” Martinez said. There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot, and flights at the airport were not affected. We have seen the crater from the impact,” said Wilfredo Strauss of the Seismic Institute. Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday. It had been projected to be roughly over New Zealand at the time of its closest approach. “We are convinced that this was a meteorite.\n",

The South American nun's case is very similar to what happened to a 33-year-old Salvadorean nun, also in Italy last year. This is not the first time a nun has mysteriously given birth after suffering from stomach pains. The Salvadorean nun told her social worker that she does not feel any guilt and only expressed eagerness to raise the child. She soon delivered a healthy baby boy, but the child currently remains in the hospital to undergo more checks. For her part, the nun said she had no idea that she was pregnant prior to her hospital admission. I feel more of a mother than a nun,\" she admitted, according to the Daily Mail. She complained of unbearable stomach pain, was rushed to the hospital, and gave birth afterwards. She decided to give the baby up for adoption, but after she was refused re-entrance to the convent, she changed her mind and decided to raise her daughter herself.

At least that’s the idea behind a pilot program the company ran last week to test a fleet of five K5 security guard robots. And if they spot something that a person should handle, they can call a human security guard over. They use cameras and sensors to keep track of their surroundings and look for suspcious activity. The K5s also use laser scanning and GPS for navigating, weather sensors, and, of course, Wi-Fi connectivity. Designed and manufactured by robotics company Knightscope, K5s weigh 300 pounds and are 5 feet tall. They have battery life of about 24 hours and can automatically bring themselves back to their charging stations when they’re low on juice. And it’s true that there’s artificial intelligence coordinating an A5’s actions and making decisions about where it should go and what it should do next. But reaction to the robots seems kind of alarmist. They can “see” license plate numbers and even analyze faces.\n",

In this incident, a plainclothes surveillance team was on duty that night outside the fence, meant to spot jumpers and give early warning before they made it over. Chaffetz said he plans to ask Pierson how an alarm meant to alert officers to intruders could be silenced or turned down. “The agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,” Chaffetz said. The officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. After barreling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first family’s living quarters. A Secret Service official told The Post that the usher’s office was concerned the boxes were frequently malfunctioning and unnecessarily sounding off.\n",

Kadalim told the site that Lin and the homeless man arrived at the liquor store in the same car. The homeless man is seen on camera buying food and giving it to strangers in the park. Update: Taugan Tan Kadalim, a passerby to the scene, told Vocativ that he witnessed some of the filming of the video and that the incident appeared to be staged. \"And they didn't go homeless because they're lazy ...It could be a divorce, and one thing leads to another.

A private autopsy performed on Aug. 17 at the request of Brown's family found that the 18-year-old was shot 6 times, including twice in the head. Johnson, said that Wilson attacked Brown, then shot at the 18-year-old as he was trying to get away.

Ertugun was the record label boss who signed Led Zeppelin to Atlantic Records, sight unseen, launching the then-unknown band’s meteoric career. When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock,” The Mirror quotes the source as saying.

      "Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is the group’s spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al Qaeda. Somali military officials last week launched a military operation to oust al-Shabaab from its last remaining bases in the southern parts of Somalia. Somali officials said all seven attackers, three government soldiers and two civilians were killed. Mogadishu’s Godka Jilacow prison is an interrogation center for Somalia’s intelligence agency, and many suspected militants are believed to be held in underground cells there. The attack started when a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison and the gunmen then fought their way into the prison. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate,” said Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby. Al-Shabaab had attacked the mall in Nairobi last year in retaliation against Kenya for sending troops into Somalia against the extremists. The spokesman would not say whether al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane was among the six militants killed. The latest US action comes after Somalia’s government forces regained control of a high-security prison in the capital that was attacked Sunday. On Saturday the militants withdrew from the town of Bulomarer, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Mogadishu, after hours of fighting.\n",

While Apple announced that the base model of its forthcoming smartwatch would cost $350, it's remained tight-lipped about the pricing of the rest of the range. The iGen.fr sources also claim that Apple is hoping to release the watch as soon as possible—though other rumors claim we may have to wait until Spring of 2015. Now, a new report suggests that the stainless steel version will start at $500, and the gold at somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000. We'll have to wait to find out, but such high pricing would indeed make it very much a luxury item. Certainly, $500 for the stainless steel version feels about right by comparison. It's thought that the $350 price applies to the aluminum model of the watch.

The laptop is speculated to ship in mid-2015 and is expected to use one of the new dual-core Broadwell chips from Intel. The new 12-inch MacBook Air is said to be smaller than its 13-inch sibling and a bit thinner than the 11-inch version. However, the specs of the new USB indicate that the Type-C can support driving displays and device charging. Much of the larger proportion of the machine's usable area will be occupied by the display panel and the keyboard. Apple is yet to make an official announcement on the new MacBook Air. It is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller than the latter, which allows it to keep a slightly bigger display.\n",

Thomas says that, after initially being sent home with antihistamines, he returned to the medical center where doctors discovered a tiny tropical spider beneath his skin. Thomas may have been told that a spider invaded his flesh, but the arachnologists we spoke to about this story sincerely doubt that one actually did.

Intelligence officials also told lawmakers that senior military officials were demoted for poor accuracy in artillery drills. Kim is believed to be recovering, South Korean lawmakers were told, but the cyst could recur due to his obesity and heavy schedule. That cyst may have caused muscle or nerve damage and prompted him to have ankle surgery between September and October, lawmaker Lee Cheol-woo said. At the briefing, lawmakers were told that \"European experts\" handled the surgery for tarsal tunnel syndrome. It was his longest absence from official events since he made his first public appearance in 2010, according to NK News, a website devoted to analyzing North Korea. South Korean lawmakers also were told that a political purge continues in North Korea, as a follow-up after the execution of Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek. His sudden disappearance took a concerning turn earlier this month when he didn't appear at events to mark the 65th anniversary of the Worker's Party of North Korea. North Korea executed 10 party officials by firing squad for charges ranging from corruption to women's issues to the viewing of a South Korean soap opera.

Conal considered cancelling his service, but decided to stick with it after a Comcast rep promised that the issues would be resolved and threw in some free perks. Shortly after that call, Comcast contacted Conal’s employer — a large accounting firm that Consumerist reports happened to do business with Comcast. Conal, understandably frustrated, decided to bypass the customer service department and take his complaints straight to the Comcast controller. During the call, he claims, he suggested that a private-sector oversight group look into Comcast’s billing and accounting issues. As another friendly gesture, the company also allegedly sent and billed Conal for $1,820 of equipment he’d never ordered. A customer named “Conal” started subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013. Conal tells Consumerist that he never mentioned his employer and that someone at Comcast must have looked him up to figure out where he worked. So much for monitoring “for quality assurance purposes.” If you want it done right, record the call yourself.

The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said of the video: “All the hallmarks point to it being genuine. Obama hailed Foley, who he called Jim, and said he had called Foley’s parents. Foley’s murder, Obama said, was “an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world.” While other jihadist entities employ terrorist and insurgent tactics, for which infiltration of another’s populace is central, Isis has mustered a highly mobile army that seizes and holds territory. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Wednesday that the video showed both Foley and Sotloff. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said it exposed Isis as the “caliphate of barbarism”.

      "The stainless steel Apple Watch model, which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover, is expected to start at $499 to $549, again depending on customizable features. Building off Apple's quoted starting price of $349, analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to $550, or $575 to $600 including additional bands. The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.

Islamic State militants have released a graphic video allegedly depicting the beheading of American photojournalist James Wright Foley, who has been missing in Syria since 2012. He is forced to read a letter which blames the US government for “hammering the final nail into his coffin” before the masked man takes his life. The Islamist group also threatened to kill another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff of World Affairs and Time, stating his fate is in the hands of President Barack Obama. In a statement, the US National Security Council confirmed it had seen the video, but added that it's still working to determine its authenticity. So far, the Islamic State’s campaign through Iraq has seen numerous reports of beheadings, including those carried out against child victims. Sotloff’s life, meanwhile, “depends on Obama’s next decision,” the group claimed. Sotloff has been missing since mid-2013, and his Twitter account indicates his last known location was Libya. Militants said, “we will drown all of you in blood” and flashed images of an American was beheading during the United States’ initial invasion of Iraq. Foley went missing almost two years ago while covering the conflict in Syria as a freelance photographer.\n",

      "An aviation security expert said the planes, if actually seized by terrorists, would pose more of a threat to countries near Libya than the U.S. homeland. The reports of the missing planes, which first surfaced in mid-August, likely sparked an international search for the planes by intelligence agencies, Price said. Airliners are required to file flight plans before entering U.S. airspace, and air-traffic monitors would be looking for aircraft matching the description of any stolen planes, Price said. An airliner could try to fly below radar to avoid detection, but the U.S. military has developed systems to detect and stop low flying threats, he said. Price said most countries near Libya, including in Europe, do not have the same air-defense capabilities and would be more at risk. A spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, Bernadette Meehan, also said there's been no confirmation that aircraft had been stolen. The latest report surfaced after an Islamist militia seized a U.S. Embassy residence in Tripoli last weekend, posting video online of men playing in a pool at the compound.

      "The most expensive Apple Watch set to go on sale in April will have to cost around $10,000, according to analysis done by the timepiece blog Grail Watch. That's mostly because the Apple Watch Edition has a frame made from solid 18-karat gold, which is very expensive. By that measure, the Apple Watch Edition's frame would cost around $8,300 for the larger 42mm version, excluding all other costs. That's assuming the watch's case is made from solid gold, not gold-plated. Grail Watch notes that gold sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per ounce these days. Even if the Apple Watch Edition sells for less than its analog competitors, it will still be Apple's most expensive product. Grail Watch predicts the larger Apple Watch Edition will go for $9,999, with the smaller version retailing for $7,999. The conventional wisdom so far has been that the Apple Watch Edition will cost $5,000. But gold-framed luxury watches usually go for well above the $10,000 mark.

As part of its insurgency, the militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike. The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. \"On the war front, we can say there is peace now,\" he said Friday.\n"

      "The Pyongyang restaurants are run in partnership with Office 39, a branch of the North Korean government, which uses them as a way of raising overseas cash. WATCHERS of North Korea's secretive regime believe it could be planning another surprise move, a restaurant in Scotland. The Cambodia eaterie Leader Kim Jong-Un has already opened a diner in Amsterdam, with the 'Pyongyang' chain of restaurants also having branches in China and parts of Asia. Michael Madden, editor of North Korea Leadership Watch, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries, especially those with left-wing leanings. He said: \"It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland. \"Despite voting no they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable than England, plus North Koreans love whisky. Proceeds from the 'Pyongyang' chain are funnelled back into North Korean government funds. \"The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean's elite's thoughts. \"Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.\"\n",

We tired it out and then lifted it out of the water.” The wels catfish, also known as the sheatfish, lives in fresh and brackish water. The fish prey on other fish, as well as worms, crustaceans, frogs and water fowl. “They don’t range over very large distances, they tend to live in the same stretch of river, moving just a few kilometres either way. The nine foot-long creature, a wels catfish, has been dubbed “the monster of the Po” by the Italian media. “Who knows, maybe we will manage to catch it again in a year’s time, and it will be even more gigantic,” said Mr Ferrari.

Egyptian military jets reportedly have conducted strikes inside Libya against Libyan Dawn positions recently, and U.S. officials said there are signs a larger Egyptian military incursion is being planned. Al Jazeera television reported in late August that western intelligence reports had warned of terror threats to the region from 11 stolen commercial jets. Michael Rubin, a counterterrorism specialist with the American Enterprise Institute, said commercial jetliners in the hands of terrorists could be formidable weapons. Mekkaoui said the jets are being held by the Libyan group called Masked Men Brigade, which was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department in December. Military forces in North Africa, including those from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt have been placed on heightened alert as a result of intelligence warning of the stolen aircraft. The Masked Men Brigade is linked to al Qaeda and Ansar al Sharia—the group behind the Benghazi terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2012. Libyan state-owned Afriqiyah Airways fleet is made up of 13 aircraft, including three Airbus 319s, seven Airbus 320s, two Airbus 330s, and one Airbus 340. “Anyone who has ever flown over Saudi Arabia at night can see refineries like Yanbu lit up like Christmas trees against the blackness of the desert,” Rubin said.

Anyone caught smoking in public will still be subject to arrest regardless of the amount of pot in view, the commissioner said. “If you saw someone smoking a joint, you would bring them back to the precinct and give them a summons if they didn’t have a record,” a source said. “It began with the mayor, as his initiative,” said an elected official familiar with the issue.

A Texas plumber is getting death threats after his old truck — still bearing his name — was tweeted on the front line by Islamic jihadists in Syria. Subsequently, his company, Mark-1 Plumbing — the name emblazoned on the pickup truck in Syria — has been bombarded with hate calls at its office in Texas City, Texas.

The Atlantic offers a few examples from the Cantonese-speaking city of Hong Kong: Many English names mimic the sound of Chinese given names. For most people, our names are our names and we have little choice in the matter. Often, Chinese people pick an English name as a play of words based on their original given Chinese name. While it's easy to make fun of such unusual naming conventions, it's also hard not to appreciate the playfulness with which these names get chosen. A humorous report on a satirical Web site done in the style of China's state broadcaster CCTV offers advice to Chinese on how to choose their English names. It offers this guide: A good way to work out the ‘feeling’ of a name is to watch a bunch of American movies and sitcoms. The report also lays out a set of rules governing the types of English names typically adopted by Chinese.

With the Apple set to release an Apple Watch, a lot of people expect a similar thing is going to happen with third-party applications from developers. For now, apps offload all the heavy lifting and computations to the tethered iPhone, which saves battery and gives developers access to the iPhone's powerful processor.

Apple currently doesn't allow developers to create standalone apps for the Apple Watch, though Apple has promised it will open up WatchKit later this year. Markiyan Matsekh, who has been developing a third-party Tesla companion app for the Apple Watch at app-company Eleks, says the limitations have presented a challenge for developers.

Later that day it had risen two or three inches higher up his body, he said. When he first went to doctors on Sunday they told him it was an insect bite and gave him some cream, NT News reported. He is also apparently hoping the ordeal leaves a “gnarly scar” on his body. Thomas told NT News: “It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated. By Monday morning the trail had started to blister. Then Thomas saw a dermatologist, who recognised things were not right.\n"

      "The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache. Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people. Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria. The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border. On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit. The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. On Tuesday, ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.' The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area. Militant: Particular blackspots for ISIS checkpoints are the roads around the militants' strongholds in Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor, as well as a number of major highways in eastern Syria.\n",

      "“One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ,” said the leader of the Catholic Church, according to Italian news sources. Pope Francis suggested recently that even animals have a place in heaven, while trying to soothe a young boy during a public appearance at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square. \"Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures,\" he told the boy whose dog died recently. In one such instance in July 2013, Francis struck a compassionate tone when speaking about homosexuality. Francis's papal name comes from St. Francis of Assisi, the church's patron saint of animals and the ecology. Vatican observers have called him a \"radical\" because of his open-mindedness and desire to reach out to \"the grassroots of Catholic life.\" This is a significant pivot from the position held by Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\" he said to reporters on a flight returning to the Vatican from Brazil.\n",

      "Looking to fiscal 2016, Milunovich's estimates increase to 40 million units, resulting in $17 billion in sales and $6.2 billion in profit. In its poll of 4,000 consumers, UBS found that 10 percent of consumers said they are \"very likely\" to buy a smartwatch in the next 12 months. Among respondents who plan to buy a smartwatch, 37 percent said they would purchase a SamsungGear, while 25 percent said they are waiting for the Apple Watch. Applying that same percentage to the total number of eligible iPhone owners, UBS believes Apple will sell 24 million Apple Watches in its first nine months of availability. \"Just as Apple wasn't the first MP3 or smartphone vendor but redefined those categories, we expect Apple Watch to become first to mind in smartwatches,\" he said. Still, in the first few months, Milunovich believes Apple will sell 24 million of its Watch with an average price between $420 and $430. Apple's fiscal 2015 concludes at the end of September, so Milunovich's estimates don't include the 2015 holiday shopping season. Milunovich expects the tables to quickly turn in early 2015, when the Apple Watch becomes available and shakes up the existing wearables market. And by 2018, his projections call for Apple to be selling 67.6 million Apple Watch units in a single fiscal year. The UBS survey also delved into specific brands, and found that for now consumers are more interested in the currently available Samsung Gear.\n",

Kim recently underwent surgery after breaking both his ankles following an arduous tour of military bases and factories in a pair of Cuban heels.

The start-up business also said in the statement that it was proud of their app user for turning over the video message to the FBI investigation. If the audio is genuine it calls into question the version of events that Officer Wilson and the Ferguson police force have claimed occurred on August 9. Experts who have listened to the audio have said it could prove damning for Officer Wilson. Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries.

Chaim Haas, head of communications at Glide, verified the tape recorded by an unnamed individual in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9.

The Telegraph revealed last month that the International Committee of the Red Cross had become involved in a secret prisoner swap deal that would ensure the schoolgirls' return. Privately, Western security sector sources in the country report exasperation among those coming to help over the slow pace of the Nigerians’ reactions to the kidnap crisis. The ICRC's role in the talks represented the first official confirmation that the Nigerian government was actively engaged in talks with Boko Haram.

In a historic change, city cops will stop arresting people on low-level marijuana charges and issue tickets instead, various police and other sources said Monday. Richard Aborn of the Citizens Crime Commission said the new rule will have the long-lasting effect of making it easier for more young people to find legitimate employment. The Drug Policy Alliance said it was “cautiously optimistic” about the new NYPD policy. \"Too many young people are being arrested for low-level drug charges that leave a permanent stain on their records for what should be a violation,\" Thompson has said. According to the Marijuana Arrest Research Project, blacks and Hispanics represented 86% of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city in the first eight months of the year. Mayor de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton were expected to announce the change Monday, but reaction to the new policy has been mixed ahead of the press conference. As it is, misdemeanor marijuana arrests are down citywide in the first 10 months of the year — about 24,000 compared to 29,000 last year. The de Blasio administration has been slow to embrace that strategy, but Bratton has spoken recently about handling some minor criminal offenses without making arrests.

      "The move would overwhelmingly affect black and Latino residents, who represented 86 percent of marijuana possession arrests in the city this year, according to the Marijuana Arrest Research Project. Nevertheless, police have continued to arrest people and charge them with misdemeanors after finding small amounts of marijuana in their pockets or belongings. But doing so means those summonses would not be subject to prosecutorial review, which would identify if a summons was justified in the first place, legal experts say. The Brooklyn DA’s office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases that involved arrest out of 2,526 such cases since July, according to the New York Times. The law made possession of the drug a ticketable offense and applied to marijuana that was out of public view and was not being smoked. Allowing police officers to write tickets without accountability creates “a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place,” Thompson told the Times. Prosecutorial reviews “perform a screening function to weed out legally insufficient cases,” Jeffrey Fagan, professor of law at Columbia Law School in New York, told International Business Times. That sentiment was echoed by Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson, who announced earlier this year that he would stop prosecuting small-scale marijuana violations. Under the current system, when an arrest is made, the charge becomes a court case reviewed by a prosecutor. “It’s not solving the problem that they’re trying to solve,” Fagan said.\n",

To make matters even more complicated, it's reported that the company Conal works for provides consulting services to Comcast. And earlier this year it was discovered that the only surefire way to get a refund from Comcast is to record your customer service call yourself. After Conal's complaint, the company promised him extra television channels as a make-good but instead sent him a variety of equipment he didn't need. He said he repeatedly called them about his bill, telling them that Comcast should be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Being an accountant, Conal contacted Comcast's comptroller, the office that looks after the company accounts. Instead, he says, someone working for Comcast researched him and discovered where he works.\n",

      "Anbar advances Meanwhile, in Iraq's western Anbar province, ISIS militants have tightened their grip over an area about 15 miles south of Falluja, a provincial official said Thursday. The Syrian opposition group also claims, citing reliable sources in Syria, that former Iraqi military officers are training members of the Sunni extremist militant group to fly them. The Pentagon said its increased focus on the area reflected greater opportunity rather than a strategic shift with regards to the importance of helping the Kurds hold Kobani. The planes are at the Al-Jarrah military airport east of the contested city of Aleppo, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The strikes are helping Kurdish fighters on the ground push back ISIS militants in the Syrian town, according to sources there. This was prompted by fear of potential suicide attacks by ISIS fighters, particularly during Friday prayers, he said. \"We're not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,\" said spokesman Col. Patrick Ryder. Al-Issawi told CNN the situation in Ramadi was critical, with \"heavy clashes between Iraqi security forces and their supporters from one side and the ISIS militants from another.\" \"It's a small little town along the border with Turkey, he said. Mahmoud urged the Iraqi government to send military reinforcements to support the security forces inside the town.\n",

Initial supply constraints are not uncommon for Apple products, especially entirely new product categories like the Watch. Demo units shown to the press have been running videos on continuous loops, and Apple hasn’t said anything about pricing. The constraints will likely result in making more expensive Apple Watch models harder to come by.

The three drones are routinely flown over Northern Iraq and data is shared in real time with the Turkish military. The United States appears to now be flying unarmed surveillance drones over the IS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria. Update A regional security expert reports Predator drones were seen operating in the civilian airport near Erbil. As such, the available evidence indicates that the drone is being used for surveillance purposes, rather than in a hunter-killer type mission. Drones are visible on radar and easy to shoot down with air defense systems. A third option is that the United States is now flying drones from an airbase in Iraqi Kurdistan. According to local activists, the drone has been circling over the city for three hours. A second option could be that the drones are being flown from Kuwait.\n",

South Korea's military returned fire after hearing the sound of the North's machinegun fire, the official said. The source said that Kim had just taken a step out of the limelight because of his leg injury. An official documentary from late last month described him as dealing with 'discomfort', which led to international speculation that he may be ill. Some rounds fell on the South side which then responded with high-calibre machine gun fire 'towards the North's guard posts,' a defence ministry spokesman said. While naval confrontations along the Koreas' disputed maritime border occur from time to time, any military engagement across the heavily-militarised land frontier is extremely rare.

The school took a group of 28 girls on the trip to the capital, Sarajevo, to see museums and city sights, according to inserbia.info. Sarajevo gynecologist Senad Mehmedbasic said the growing rate is worrisome because teens face higher risks in both pregnancy and child birth. Parents are demanding why there wasn't better supervision on the trip, according to the Courier Mail. \"It must not be allowed that the street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.\" But Babici said parents need to teach their children about sex. A quarter of the students returned home pregnant. The case has brought national attention to the increasing number of teen pregnancies in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n",

      "The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State group. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache. Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria. Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people. On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit. The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border. The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said the U.S. had seen the video but couldn't confirm its accuracy and was seeking more information. The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area. On Tuesday, IS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said \"Team USA.\"\n",

The militants, who posted the video on YouTube Tuesday, said Foley’s killing was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. “Today the entire world is appalled at the brutal murder of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIL,” Obama said, using one of several acronyms for the group. In an interview with the BBC, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. A masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back. Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq.

Their AI and camera rigs enable the K5s to do a good deal of profiling, scanning license plates and faces to compare against databases available to them over Wi-Fi. The K5 robots are only tools to surveil, assess and report suspicious activity, for now at least.
